[+] in the UEFA Euro 2020 Championship Final between Italy and England at Wembley Stadium on July 11, 2021 in London, England. (Photo by Andy Rain - Pool/Getty Images) Getty Images Teams hoping to win the World Cup not only have to beat their opponents, they need to beat the local climate and conditions. Games played at altitude, in soaring temperatures, or with huge distances between venues can make or break a team\u2019s tournament. At the 2014 World Cup, an energy-sapping encounter in Manaus, deep in the hot and humid Amazon basin, exhausted England and Italy\u2019s players, and was partially blamed for both countries\u2019 group-stage exits. Many of these challenges are caused simply by the diverse nature of our planet. But for the 2030 World Cup, FIFA has skewed the field for its own political reasons. Reports suggest that the 2030 World Cup will be hosted in Spain, Portugal and Morocco, but with the opening three matches played across the ocean in South America. Uruguay, Paraguay and Argentina had bid for the 2030 tournament, with a main focus of their bid being that it would be 100 years since the first World Cup in Uruguay, so it would be nice and sentimental to host the centenary event there too (despite most of the games being in neighboring Argentina). In some feat of sporting diplomacy, it seems the bulk of the 2030 tournament will now be played in Europe and North Africa, with the opening three games being played in Uruguay, Paraguay and Argentina to reflect this centenary year.

Local South Americans will be unlikely to get any tickets despite \u201chosting\u201d a World Cup, national team fans will have to add a transatlantic ticket to their World Cup expenses, and while Infantino says 2030 \u201cwill have a unique global footprint,\u201d it seems he hasn\u2019t considered the tournament\u2019s carbon footprint . The decision to host the opening three games in South America could also impact the sporting integrity of the tournament. Buenos Aires is more than 10,000 kilometers, or a 12-hour flight, from Madrid. That\u2019s more than double the distance between 2026 host cities Vancouver and Miami, and more than three times the distance between the two furthest apart cities at Russia 2018. While Madrid and Morocco could be in the middle of summer heatwaves during the World Cup, it will be winter in Buenos Aires with the daily mean temperature in June just 12 degrees Celsius (53 degrees Fahrenheit), and there is a six-hour time difference between Paraguay and Spain. The effect of travel on performance can be seen at Euro 2020 , which was held across Europe and had huge disparities between distances traveled, with some countries potentially traveling more than ten times further than others. Out of all the teams to reach the knockout stages, the two finalists, England and Italy, had the shortest total distance from their opening game to the final. Semi-finalists Denmark had the second shortest distance to travel up to the round of 16, where they won 4-0 against Wales, who had the fifth longest distance at that stage. The other semi-finalist, Spain, had the fifth shortest route to the final. And in the three-day turnaround between the quarterfinals and semifinals, the two losers of the semifinals had much longer journeys to London from Baku and Saint Petersburg. Correlation might not be causation, but there is certainly some correlation between the distances traveled and results during Euro 2020. Overcoming the local conditions is part of tournament soccer. As far back as the Mexico 1986 World Cup, England trained in steam rooms at altitude in Colorado to try to prepare for with the altitude of Mexico City and extreme heat of Monterrey. But depending on the fixture schedule, six teams at the 2030 World Cup could possibly have to travel an extra 10,000 miles more than their next opponents. They will also need to find two base camps, disrupting their tournament preparations. Whether it shows in the next game, or through accumulated fatigue as the tournament progresses, these kinds of factors can make the difference between winning and losing. Follow me on Twitter .

    "content": "People who seek help for mental health issues should be asked about problem gambling in the same way they are asked about drugs, smoking and alcohol, new guidance has suggested. According to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice), those who visit an NHS health professional in England for depression, anxiety or thoughts about self-harm or suicide due to a possible addiction, such as alcohol or drugs, could be at a greater risk of harm from gambling. Nice said questions should be asked about patients\u2019 gambling habits to ensure they can cope with their thoughts and urges. In new draft guidance, it suggested patients should be encouraged to assess the severity of their gambling by using a questionnaire available on the NHS website. Those who score eight or higher should seek support and treatment from gambling services. Health professionals should also discuss software blocking tools to limit online gambling and consider cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) as an option. NHS England has said about 1,400 people were referred for help for gambling addiction last year, up by a third on 2021. Prof Jonathan Benger, the chief medical officer and interim director of the centre for guidelines at Nice, said: \u201cHarmful gambling causes immense misery to all those who experience it. We want those needing help or who are at risk to be identified sooner and receive appropriate help.\u201d Since 2019, NHS England has opened 12 gambling treatment clinics, with a further three due to open in the coming months. It is planning to treat up to 3,000 people a year across the 15 facilities, as part of the NHS long-term plan. Benger added: \u201cThe independent committee who made these draft recommendations included both clinicians and people with personal experience of harmful gambling. They scrutinised all the available evidence to identify treatments and therapies that have been shown to work and offer good value for money. The result is this useful and usable advice to help NHS clinics as they develop their service.\u201d Fiona Macleod, the director of services at the charity GamCare, said the Nice guidance was \u201can important step\u201d. \u201cIdentifying an issue with gambling as early as possible is vital to prevent harm from occurring later down the line, and we know that there is an important role that healthcare professionals can play in helping more people find the support they need. \u201cWe believe these recommendations, if implemented, will present a greater opportunity to prevent gambling harms from occurring in the UK. They represent an important step in encouraging more people to seek support, through services such as those GamCare provides.\u201d Zo\u00eb Osmond, the chief executive of GambleAware, also welcomed the draft guidance. \u201cGambling harms are a serious public health issue, which can affect anyone, and healthcare professionals are ideally placed to identify and help people experiencing them,\u201d she said. \u201cWe welcome the development of guidelines to further inform treatment for those seriously affected by gambling harm and will be responding to the consultation with our views.\u201d The NHS England mental health director, Claire Murdoch, said: \u201cGambling addiction is a cruel disease that destroys people\u2019s lives, and the NHS is already playing its part in treating it with four new specialist clinics opening in recent months and a further three opening later this year, so if you\u2019re struggling, please come forward for help. \u201cWe will work with Nice on this consultation process and while this new guidance will ensure the NHS can help even more people struggling with gambling addiction to receive evidenced-based treatment, it is vital that the billion-pound industry also takes action in line with the government\u2019s white paper to stop people coming to harm in the first place.\u201d In April, the government outlined plans to reform gambling to ensure regulation meets new challenges as the \u201clandscape has changed significantly since 2005\u201d.

Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin The cricket World Cup starts on October 5 (Photo by Matthew Lewis-ICC/ICC via Getty Images) ICC via Getty Images The cricket World Cup starts on October 5 in the sport's rabid heartland. India which famously last hosted the event in 2011 when a MS Dhoni title-clinching six into a sea of ecstatic fans became instantly etched into lore. Even though T20s had been around for some time, with two T20 World Cups contested and the Indian Premier League exploding onto the scene in 2008, the most important prize was undoubtedly the World Cup of the 50-over variety. Back then there was no need to differentiate. The World Cup was the World Cup. The T20 equivalent was a little bit mickey mouse at the international level, still not taken seriously. But things have changed significantly in the last 12 years. The shorter three-hour format of T20 has grabbed the hearts of a younger generation, spawning lucrative domestic leagues globally, and proving a suitable game for this instant gratification era. Last year's T20 World Cup , marked by an epic India-Pakistan contest at a 90,000 MCG, felt like the tournament had really arrived. And the next event - just eight months away - might be a definitive moment for the sport with it being co-hosted by the U.S. Kohli inspired India to an amazing victory over arch-rivals Pakistan (Photo by Daniel ...

There has been much debate over the future of the 50-over format - which is played over around eight hours - and whether it should be significantly reduced or ditched entirely. As I reported recently, ODI's immediate future is secure with cricket's powerbrokers intent on protecting the format. ODIs still holds significant cache because of the 50-over World Cup, which is a money-spinner and remains the most coveted prize for players. It won't be going anywhere because there are World Cups in the next cycle of events in 2027 and 2031. For the next event, which will be played in South Africa, Zimbabwe and Namibia, the World Cup will finally expand from its measly number of 10 teams to 14. That means smaller cricket nations will need more exposure beforehand to ensure they are competitive for the next World Cup. But amid such a crammed calendar, with ODIs seemingly the casualty, there will be precious opportunities for them. With seemingly little appetite, despite administrators saying otherwise, the format is clearly on the nose, played less these days with little fanfare from fans. It's saddening for a previous generation when the 50-over format was the most exciting spectacle imaginable. ODI cricket once attracted packed crowds (Photo by Tony Marshall/EMPICS via Getty Images) PA Images via Getty Images There have already been reports from India that this cricket-mad country has been less enthused over the World Cup. Sports fever is currently centered over India's strong showing at the Asian Games - the world's second biggest multi-sport event being contested in Hangzhou, China. Inevitably, especially if hosts and favorites India start getting on a roll, the World Cup will ignite and it could lead to a swirl of nostalgia. Maybe fans will believe the format can offer the right balance of Test cricket's slow burn along with T20's manic approach. Or perhaps this will be something of a last dance, where the often excruciating middle overs makes everyone realise that the format is a relic. Either way, 50-over cricket will be the center of attention in the cricket world. Something that rarely happens these days. Follow me on Twitter .

File Photo: Commander, US President Joe Biden and US First Lady Jill Bidens German Shepherd, is ... [+] taken for a walk on the South Lawn before their return to the White House in Washington, DC. AFP via Getty Images Key Facts The First Lady\u2019s spokesperson said Commander \u201cis not presently on the White House campus while next steps are evaluated,\u201d the Associated Press reported . The spokesperson noted that the Bidens are \u201cgrateful for the patience and support\u201d of the Secret Service staffers and all other staffers as they attempt to \u201cwork through solutions.\u201d Last month, a tourist took a photo of Commander biting Dale Haney, the White House\u2019s chief groundskeeper and later that month the dog bit a Secret Service officer. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre commented on the photo of Commander biting Haney and said the dog and the chief groundskeeper were playing and no skin was broken at the time. What To Watch For It is unclear where the 2-year-old German shepherd is living currently and if there are plans to bring him back to the White House. The First Lady\u2019s spokesperson said the White House can be a \u201cstressful environment\u201d for pets and the family was working on \u201cways to help Commander handle the often unpredictable nature of the White House grounds.\u201d Key Background Aside from the two biting incidents reported last month, the 2-year-old German shepherd has bitten Secret Service personnel at least 10 other times , according to the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s records. The ten earlier biting incidents were recorded between October 2022 and January 2023, one of which required a hospital visit. It is unknown if any other biting incidents have taken place between January and September. Biden\u2019s older German Shepherd Major was also involved in several biting incidents, which eventually resulted in him moving out of the White House. Tangent CNN reported that Secret Service personnel at the White House had raised concerns about workplace safety over the biting incidents. One source cited by CNN referred to the work environment as \u201chostile\u201d and \u201cdangerous\u201d adding that agents are forced to avoid some entrances and routes inside the building to avoid getting bitten by Commander. Despite purportedly receiving assurances that the dog would receive appropriate training, the incidents continued to happen.

Sophomore wing Joseph Pinion led six Red players in double figures with a game-high 20 points (7-of-8 field goals, including 3-of-4 from 3, and 3-of-4 free throws) to go with 4 rebounds, 1 assist, 1 steal, and boxscore plus-13 in 27 minutes as his team broke a 41-all tie at halftime to topple the White, 88-70, in front of a hearty crowd of nearly 5,500 inside the venue that the men\u2019s and women\u2019s basketball teams called home through the 1992-93 season. Seven different Hogs hit three\u2019s as the teams combined for 14-of-28 shooting from distance (50%). \u201cFirst of all, the crowd was awesome,\u201d Head Hog Eric Musselman said after the game. \u201cIt was closer to 6,000 than 5,500. So the turnout when the weather\u2019s not great, and we\u2019re still a long way from playing a game. So I thought the crowd was awesome. \u201cI think the guys felt that, even pregame. A lot of things we need to clean up, we need to get better. But all things that we think are teachable. The shooting is obviously \u2026 We\u2019re going to be able to stretch the defense out a little bit more than maybe we have in the past. So really pleased with our shooting. Pretty pleased wit how the flow of the offense is. We\u2019re running an offense that we ran for about 10 games two years ago that\u2019s kind of what Milwaukee ran two years ago. And it requires a lot of thinking and a lot of reading and pretty happy with how far advanced the guys are with that. Obviously we\u2019ve got to get a lot, lot better. Some guys are further advanced on knowing this than others, but that\u2019ll hopefully come over time.\u201d Senior lead guard El Ellis had a strong floor game for the Red with his 16 points (8-10 field goals), game-high 6 assists, 1 steal, 1 turnover, and boxscore plus-17 in 28 minutes.

The Red team shot a blistering 37-of-54 from the field (68.5%), including 6-of-11 from 3 (54.5%), and 8-of-11 at the free throw line (72.7%). The Red dominated the glass (plus-10 at 27-17) and turnovers [plus-6 at 13-7, including plus-7 in steals at 10-3). The White team shot 26-of-47 from the field (55.3%), including 8-of-17 from 3 (47.1%), and 10-of-15 from the foul line (66.7%). It seemed unlikely that Brazile would play given what Musselman told the media following practice on Thursday, Sept. 28, which was Brazile (he\u2019s completing recovery on his injured knee that ended his season nearly a year ago in early December 2022) would likely begin competing in live, full-contact scrimmaging in \u201ctwo-and-a-half weeks.\u201d Indeed, Brazile was not included on either roster for the Red/White tilt. Musselman updated Brazile\u2019s status following the Red/White game. \u201cWith TB, we\u2019re being \u2014 like, I want TB in March,\u201d Musselman said. \u201cI mean, we want him to get his rhythm and all that. He\u2019s done an awesome job. He\u2019s been cleared. He\u2019s been with his rehab guy. They\u2019ve done all the testing. Everything is great. Probably could\u2019ve played tonight, three minutes a half, but why? \u201cWe want him to go a little more three-on-three. He\u2019s been going three-on-three live after we\u2019re done with practice. So, he\u2019ll go three-on-three live one more time this week at some point. But he\u2019s been jumping into all of our drills. Offensively, when a player is coming back from an injury like that, that\u2019s not really an issue. The issue is, \u2018I\u2019m guarding you or you or you and I got to react.\u2019 And so that\u2019s why we want to take our time. No real timeline other than we certainly \u2014 with the way it\u2019s going now, he\u2019s playing opening night.\u201d Junior guard Khalif Battle went through early pre-game warmups, but left the court appearing to favor his right foot. When he returned to the court, he was in street clothes and on crutches with his foot in a walking boot. Musselman also addressed Battle\u2019s injury status after the game. \u201cHe practiced today,\u201d Musselman said of Battle. \u201cI walked over and got in the gym and he said his foot was really sore. They took him for a preliminary look over at the football facility. At that point, nothing, there was no determination there was anything, no break or anything. But I know that they\u2019re going to look at it again tomorrow with some different X-rays or whatever. \u201cAs of now, no update, nothing other than the fact he felt uncomfortable. Not in the same spot where he had a break earlier. Same foot, but not really related as of now. But we did have more than one doctor look at him over at football. Then we had a couple more doctors in our locker room. So right now, nothing unless whatever tests they run, something comes up.\u201d My midnight in Fayetteville takeaways (2 parts) following Arkansas' Red/White Showcase on Wed @ Barnhill Arena -Rain falling outside, Hogs raining 3's inside -Players who stood out -Injury updates -Key recruiting updates, incl '24 Hog target announcing on Thurs More Arkansas Razorbacks R/W gm highlights from Barnhill -Makhi Mitchell drives left for window finish (reel 1) -Jeremiah Davenport drives paint for runner (reel 2) -Joseph Pinion dials up his 3rd triple (reel 3) -Davenport w/lightning-fast release on C&S corner 3 (reel 4) More Arkansas Razorbacks R/W gm highlights from Barnhill Arena on Wed \u2026 -Chandler Lawson wing middy (reel 1) -El Ellis drains corner Jnin transition (reel 2) -Devo & Lawson w/brilliant give-&-go in transition (reel 3) -Denijay Harris smash-cashes in 1 of his 5 stls (reel 4) One of the strengths of senior big man Makhi Mitchell's game is his roll to the cup after setting a pick \u2026 nice 2-man game here as sophomore G Keyon Menifield, Jr. fitted in a dime to set up Khi's finish \u2026 from R/W game @ Barnhill Arena on Wed \u2026 Arkansas senior forward Chandler Lawson was solid, finishing w/dbl-dbl (13p, 10r, 2b, 1s) in the Red win \u2026 Lawson's length, instincts tracking down rbs & battling for 50/50-balls in the paint, & competent face-up shooting look top-rotation worthy \u2026 Arkansas guard Devo Davis was givin' junior wing Tramon Mark the business on D \u2026 until \u2026 well, Mark hit the gas & snow-coned the finish off the window for the White team \u2026 This \u2026 is \u2026 Arkansas sophomore wing \u2026 JOSEPH PINION !!!

    "content": "Darren Kellenschwiler\u2019s long BSV blockchain history runs from the tumultuous days of the BCH-BSV split to his current role as a technical lead at the . On this week\u2019s , Darren takes a trip down memory lane with Charles Miller, recalling the end of 2018 when he hosted Bitcoin meetups in London. It was during this period that the BCH and BSV split occurred, resulting in heated debates and ideological divisions within the community. Darren recalled the atmosphere, when \u201ceverything was a little tumultuous, and people were taking different ideological stances. There were very strong arguments\u2014over a beer! That\u2019s the sort of atmosphere at that time. It was the hash wars era.\u201d Darren was on the BSV blockchain side of the divide, firmly believing in Dr. Craig Wright as the inventor of . As he explained, \u201cI had made my mind up years before that this chap, Dr Wright is the inventor of Bitcoin. So I didn\u2019t really waste my time with the crowd that were somehow rebelling against him.\u201d As BSV blockchain emerged, Darren took \u201ca leap of faith\u201d despite the ongoing debates about Dr. Craig Wright. As he says, \u201cThere wasn\u2019t a lot of public detail with respect to the evidence for Dr. Craig Wright having invented Bitcoin.\u201d This period also marked the birth of the \u201cBitcoin protocol is set in stone\u201d campaign. One of Darren\u2019s notable contributions to the BSV blockchain community was , an email application integrated with micropayments. He explained his motivation behind it: \u201cI don\u2019t like spam. I hate reading emails that are not relevant to me. So I thought, attach some value to it. We\u2019ll create \u2018inbox economics,\u2019 where the highest in the inbox is the person who paid you the most for you to read it.\u201d While Baemail gained quick adoption within the BSV blockchain community, it faced challenges in achieving widespread usage due to limitations in BSV wallet adoption. Darren\u2019s journey continued when he met Brendan Lee from at a conference in London. Brendan bought Baemail and hired Darren, making him a co-founder of the company. Together, they delved into building Metanet applications and experimenting with hosting entire websites on the Metanet, a concept that was both groundbreaking and esoteric at the time. Today, Darren serves as the technical lead of the utilization value stream at the BSV Blockchain Association. He described his role as multifaceted, involving contributions to various aspects of the BSV blockchain ecosystem. He also emphasized the Association\u2019s responsibility to ensure that the user experience and businesses built on BSV blockchain remain intact and thrive. Darren also highlighted his passion for tackling complex challenges and his role in documenting, analyzing, and improving wallet architectures within the BSV blockchain ecosystem. He mentioned the importance of effective communication and collaboration with developers, including discussions with Dr. Craig Wright, to advance the ecosystem\u2019s growth and development. Darren Kellenschwiler\u2019s journey in the BSV blockchain ecosystem exemplifies the resilience and dedication of individuals committed to the vision of a stable, scalable, and innovative blockchain. As BSV blockchain continues to evolve, Darren and others like him play a pivotal role in shaping its future.",

    "description": "Political scientist Theda Skocpol on how tea party politics laid the foundation for the GOP\u2019s current troubles.",
    "content": "In the hours after the House of Representatives\u2019 historic vote to oust Kevin McCarthy from the speakership, a photo began circulating online of the cover of Young Guns , the splashy policy treatise authored by then-Reps. Eric Cantor, Paul Ryan and Kevin McCarthy in 2010. The irony of the photo was clear enough: The book, which featured a gleaming group portrait of the three self-declared standard-bearers of the Republican Party, was intended to introduce the rising stars of the GOP to the American people \u2014 but now, just 13 years after its publication, the book had become a visual obituary for the party\u2019s past. When I called Theda Skocpol \u2014 a political scientist at Harvard University who\u2019s written extensively about the rise of the tea party and the transformation of the Republican Party \u2014 shortly after the House kicked McCarthy out of the speakership, she was staring at this same photo. \u201cI\u2019m sitting here looking at a picture on my iPad of the three \u2018Young Guns\u2019 from that iconic cover of their book,\u201d she said. \u201cAll three of them were felled in succession by the popular anger of the tea party base.\u201d The tea party that Skocpol was referring to no longer formally exists as a faction in Congress, its erstwhile allies having been subsumed into the far-right Freedom Caucus or into the generic \u201cAmerica First\u201d wing of the GOP. But according to Skocpol, the history of the tea party remains essential to understanding the forces that ultimately led to McCarthy\u2019s political demise. \u201cIt represents the culmination of [the tea party movement],\u201d said Skocpol. \u201cAll the research that I and other political scientists have done on the movement shows that by the 2010s \u2014 just before Donald Trump emerges \u2014 the tea party had taken the shape of a just-say-no, blow-it-all-up, don\u2019t-cooperate, do-politics-on-Twitter faction \u2014 and this is the perfect expression of it. This is where it leads.\u201d In some respects, Skocpol\u2019s argument is counterintuitive. In the late 2000s and early 2010s, McCarthy and the other Young Guns rose to power by harnessing the grassroots power of the tea party movement, promising to slash government spending, constrain federal power and foil the Obama administration\u2019s policy goals. But though McCarthy and the other Young Guns rose to prominence by allying themselves with the tea party movement, Skocpol said, their banishment from the GOP doesn\u2019t mark a break with the movement\u2019s legacy. Instead, it shows that the Young Guns never really understood the forces that they helped unleash. \u201cThe fact that McCarthy and the other Young Guns were once called tea party people because they dallied with the movement,\u201d Skocpol said, \u201cdoes not mean that the tiger wasn\u2019t going to consume them in the end.\u201d The following has been edited for clarity and concision. Ian Ward: You\u2019ve written extensively about the history of the tea party movement and its aftereffects for the Republican Party. How does the vote to oust Speaker McCarthy fit into that history? Theda Skocpol: Shortly into Barack Obama\u2019s presidency, we saw this explosion of tea party demonstrations and a remarkable degree of grassroots organizing \u2014 a couple thousand local tea parties, according to our research. There was a lot of writing at the time claiming that this organization was motivated by the same thing that people now claim drives the Republican Party when they shut down the government \u2014 cutting the deficit. But it was never about cutting the deficit. The popular side of the tea party was about anger and fear of a changing country in which a guy with \u2018Hussein\u2019 as his middle name and black skin could be elected president. The tea party \u2014 especially at the grassroots \u2014 was trying to pressure the Republican Party and its elected leaders not to compromise with a changing country or with Democratic Party politicians in Washington. Ward: How did the Young Guns fit into that mobilization? Skocpol: The tea party mobilization made a big difference electorally in 2010 in installing a Republican Congress, and probably even more importantly in installing Republican-dominated state legislatures. But it was especially potent after that in undoing any effort at compromise over immigration. Our research shows that polarization over immigration between the two major parties has played out recently and piled on top of the polarization over the civil rights revolution of the 1960s. By the time you get to the period at the end of Barack Obama\u2019s presidency, he\u2019s trying to find a way to incorporate long-present immigrants from Mexico and Central America and give them a path to citizenship \u2014 and that effort falls apart in 2013 and 2014. Remember that election in which David Brat in central Virginia shockingly felled Eric Cantor, who at that time was seen as the kind of rising golden boy on the Republican right? It was anger over the potential of immigration reform that played a big role in that. And then you have Paul Ryan, who inherited a Congress where the Republican caucus was increasingly riven by the rise of this angry, just-say-no style that the tea party always favored. They wanted to make sure that people were angry about changes in the country and wanted to make sure Republicans were not compromising about those. Paul Ryan was [from] Mr. Koch\u2019s network. I think that House Republicans thought that by making him their leader, they would cement their right-wing Republican credentials\u2014 and it did with the elites around the Republican Party at the time. But among the populist right \u2014 who make up more than half of Republican base voters and the most loyal primary voters \u2014they never liked what he had to offer. So he was gone before long. And now finally, we get to Kevin McCarthy, who is just an example of the final transmogrification of the tea party anger, which was given a national focus and much more potency by Donald Trump. Donald Trump didn\u2019t create all this. He\u2019s just been very good, ever since 2015, at giving it permission and focus. Ward: McCarthy and the other Young Guns who rose to power during that tea party moment in the late 2000s and early 2010s gave voice to one interpretation of the tea party movement that you mentioned, which is that it was all about fiscal conservatism and small government. Why do you think they so dramatically misunderstood the energies behind the movement? Skocpol: We have to understand the radicalization of the Republican Party as a process that has been underway since 2000. Act 1 of that radicalization was the rise of the Koch network, which was itself motivated by displeasure with what the Republicans under Bush junior and senior had been doing \u2014 for example, passing Medicare expenditures. The Koch network outflanked the Republican Party, and they put a lot of pressure on candidates and officeholders to hew the line on cutting taxes, cutting regulations and disabling public sector unions. These Young Guns were initially in tune with that \u2014 and why wouldn\u2019t they be? They thought that\u2019s where the money came from and where the business community had gone. But that wasn\u2019t satisfactory to a lot of base voters around the Republican Party, who were much angrier about social changes in the country and much more upset about immigration. So I think the Republican Party was first hollowed out at the top, and then the tea party crystallized when Barack Obama was elected president and then it ended up being given further expression during the immigration reform battles and the rise of Donald Trump. I call it the bottom-up radicalization of the Republican Party, and I think it caught a lot of these Koch network darlings, including all three of these Young Guns, by surprise \u2014 although in McCarthy\u2019s case, I think he has done his best to ride the tiger. He\u2019s tried to have it both ways. Ward: Why do you think McCarthy was able to ride that tiger for longer than the other two? Skocpol: He\u2019s a shapeshifter, and that\u2019s given him staying power \u2014 up until the moment he had Democratic votes to keep the government open and then went on TV over the weekend and trashed the Democrats. The shape shifting is both a strength and a weakness. It\u2019s a strength in that, a little bit more effectively than Paul Ryan before him, he\u2019s been able to have it both ways \u2014 to condemn Donald Trump and then embrace him, to say he\u2019s about cutting the deficit and he\u2019s about cracking down on the border. If the Republican Party really had wings \u2014 and I don\u2019t think it does at this point \u2014 he might have been able to bridge them. But by the end, he got to the point where nobody trusted him. I don\u2019t think anybody in the Republican Party trusted his word, and Democrats definitely couldn\u2019t. Ward: Given the fact that McCarthy rose to power during the tea party moment, is there any sense in which his ouster represents a repudiation of the tea party legacy? Skocpol: No \u2014 it represents the culmination of it. I think most people in the in the media thought the tea party was about cutting the federal budget deficit because that\u2019s what a few elite spokesmen on TV said it was about. But our research always showed that at the grassroots, it was about popular anger over a changing country and fury at a Republican Party that was not responding to that desire. All the research that I and other political scientists have done on the movement shows that by the 2010s, just before Donald Trump emerges, the tea party had taken the shape of a just-say-no, blow-it-all-up, don\u2019t-cooperate, do-politics-on-Twitter faction \u2014 and this is the perfect expression of it. This is where it leads. The fact that McCarthy and the other Young Guns were once called tea party people because they dallied with the movement does not mean that the tiger wasn\u2019t going to consume them in the end. Ward: The conflict between the tea party and the Obama-era Republican Party reflected some real ideological differences between those two factions, especially on issues like immigration. Do you think the conflict between the far-right, anti-McCarthy wing of the party and McCarthy\u2019s backers reflects a similarly robust ideological fissure? Or does it just boil down to rank obstructionism? Skocpol : I think it\u2019s post-ideological. One of the things that Trump\u2019s presidency accomplished was to give national expression to populist ethno-nationalism and anger at \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d in Washington, D.C, and you get to a certain point where there aren\u2019t many moderates at all in the Republican House caucus. There certainly are some people who are cross pressured because they come from Biden districts, but most of them have been enthusiastic supporters of the same kinds of issues that Matt Gaetz is speaking to. This is a disagreement over whether you should ever settle for less than 100 percent of what you want, even when you\u2019re in a position where you don\u2019t control more than one chamber. Ward: So if the conflict is essentially about tactics and the real energies behind the far right are cultural, why do people like Gaetz still lean so heavily on the language of fiscal conservatism? After all, this most recent incident was partly set off by McCarthy\u2019s unwillingness or inability to slash spending levels. Skocpol: You\u2019re not going to like the answer I\u2019m going to give you. Ward: Try me. Skocpol: It sells with the Washington press corps. Why anybody believes this is beyond me. Did you see what Donald Trump did when he was office? Did you see what Republicans did when they controlled the entire Congress? They don\u2019t cut anything, except taxes. And that keeps a certain number of billionaires \u2014 and even Charles Koch himself \u2014 happy. There are two strands that have played out in the Republican Party during recent years. One of them I call \u201cMcConnellism.\u201d McConnellism is clever. It\u2019s about using every lever of power to make sure Republicans get the federal judiciary full of judges who are going to disempower Democratic initiatives, and it\u2019s about doing everything you can to shape the electorate, both by encouraging your own voters and discouraging the other guys\u2019 voters. It\u2019s at the edge of what\u2019s legally and constitutionally legitimate. Then there\u2019s Trumpism, which at this point has gone from bullying and threatening to actual calls for violence. One of them is very powerful in the House, and the other is very powerful in the Senate. But it\u2019s a tactical difference. It\u2019s not as if there\u2019s a huge difference of policy. I think there might be some differences in policy over immigration, but those don\u2019t really come up because nobody\u2019s talking about legislating on immigration. Ward: So what does all this mean for the future of the Republican Party? What are the ramifications of the argument that you\u2019re making \u2014 that there\u2019s a fundamental continuity between the tea party movement and the MAGA movement? Skocpol: Well, everything depends on whether Donald Trump is reelected president, and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s impossible. I really don\u2019t. As for the House of Representatives, I really do not know how they\u2019re going to find a new Kevin McCarthy who can promise enough because the promises that are being demanded are impossible to fulfill. Ward: Based on the traditional tea party playbook, though, what do you think the endgame here is for the far-right faction in the House? Skocpol: Well, I think Matt Gaetz himself wants to get on TV, raise a lot of money and run for another office. That\u2019s true of a number of the people who make up this very small group of people who were in a position to pull the hook on the grenade. But I don\u2019t think we know how this is going to come out. If you\u2019ve got people in power who are backed by a large number of voters who are angry, fearful, limited in the information they get about what\u2019s going on and thinking that it would be better to blow America up than to save it \u2014 I think you\u2019re in uncharted territory. We are in uncharted territory.",

The 2024 presidential hopeful, who is polling second behind former President Donald Trump in the race for the Republican nomination, promises an energy policy to benefit \u201cMidland over Moscow,\u201d \u201cThe Marcellus over the Mullahs,\u201d and \u201cthe Bakken over Beijing.\u201d An all-of-the-above energy plan makes sense for a country as rich in natural resources as the United States, but there\u2019s always the risk of national campaigns to throw the baby out with the bathwater. \u201cThe self-imposed handcuffs on oil, gas, and critical minerals extraction will be removed,\u201d DeSantis said at a late-September campaign event in Midland, Texas, the heart of the Permian Basin, the nation\u2019s largest oil-producing basin. To remove those handcuffs, DeSantis wants to unwind the United State\u2019s current climate commitments, including withdrawing from the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement. Former President Donald Trump exited the Paris Agreement in 2017, a decision incoming President Joe Biden reversed on his first day in the Oval Office.

I believe the Biden administration has overreached in advancing a rapid transition to an all-electric economy, but not every policy decision is wrong. Correcting course will require a deft hand that can keep what works while ensuring that American families and businesses have access to abundant and affordable energy. The next administration should conduct a full review of the current policies to ensure that abundance, affordability, and American-produced are at the top of the to-do list. In addition to pulling out of the Paris deal, DeSantis says he would walk back the 2021 Global Methane Pledge to slash emissions globally by at least 30% by 2030 from 2020 levels and strike environmental, social, and governance (ESG) disclosure requirements that have tempered investors\u2019 confidence in traditional energy stocks despite the industry paying record dividends. The domestic oil and gas industry is committed to reducing emissions and minimizing the environmental impact of its activities, so eliminating artificial barriers to investment and access to capital, as the ESG trend has done, is a good start toward achieving our universal environmental goals. Like Trump\u2019s \u201cMaking America Energy Independent Again\u201d agenda , DeSantis leans heavily on pledges to rip up the Biden administration\u2019s policies favoring climate change over energy security and economic growth, including reversing restrictions to oil and gas production on public lands. Energy abundance and affordability should be our highest goals. A wealthy nation is far better positioned to address the challenges of a changing climate than a poor one. DeSantis promises to \u201cexpand federal lease sales and devolve more leasing authority to the states.\u201d The Biden administration has largely constrained new leasing to court-ordered sales or those prescribed in last year\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act. The administration recently canceled leases in Alaska\u2019s National Petroleum Reserve (NPR\u2013A), frustrating the industry and Republicans on Capitol Hill, and released a five-year offshore leasing plan that made no one happy. DeSantis is pledging to refill the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR), which Biden tapped before the 2020 election to tame rising gas prices \u2013 another example of politics interfering with public policy decisions. DeSantis says he would only use the nation\u2019s emergency oil reserve \u2013 the SPR is at its lowest level since the early 1980s \u2013 for actual supply disruptions. Given the geopolitical situation in Europe and the revanchment of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its Russian ally, to say nothing of the rise of China, maintaining robust reserves makes sense. DeSantis promises to revitalize America\u2019s nuclear and automobile industries. DeSantis would repeal Biden\u2019s electric vehicle (EVs) mandates and \u201csupport Americans\u2019 right to drive the cars they want.\u201d That doesn\u2019t mean he opposes EVs, but he believes they must be able to compete in the marketplace without government subsidies. DeSantis says he plans to jumpstart critical mineral mining on federal lands and create a strategic reserve of critical minerals to ensure America can compete in the energy transition with China, which controls 90% of the world's critical minerals. Streamlining environmental reviews and permitting is another priority for the Florida governor, as is preventing \u201cabusive litigation\u201d by environmental groups that have used the courts to block projects like the Dakota Access and Keystone XL pipelines by filing frivolous lawsuits. New rules targeting natural gas stoves, furnaces, and appliances would be repealed under DeSantis, giving Americans greater choice in how they want to cook and heat their homes. Such nanny state laws should be repealed wherever they are found because they create hurdles for competition and innovation in the marketplace. DeSantis likewise promises to repeal Biden\u2019s Clean Energy Plan , which demands a 90% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2035-2040 from power plants \u2013 essentially forcing a switch to renewable energy sources like wind and solar despite cost considerations. The country might be better served by a more modest goal that's attainable and doesn't scare off investment in the energy resources we need today \u2013 and will need for decades to come. The boldest \u2013 and most controversial \u2013 part of DeSantis\u2019 agenda is his promise of $2 per gallon retail gasoline prices by 2025, requiring pump prices to fall by about $1.85 from the current national average. That would require a crude oil price of about $55 a barrel, which could hurt U.S. crude oil production by putting too many new prospects below breakeven cost levels for new wells. U.S. refiners may also lack the capacity to deliver gasoline at that price level. Indeed, gasoline prices haven\u2019t touched the $2 a gallon level since the depths of the pandemic in 2020, when fuel demand collapsed under the weight of government-mandated lockdowns. Such a sharp price drop would also require cooperation from the OPEC cartel, whose member states are cutting supply to boost prices above $100 a barrel. The fix is literally in to keep pump prices high. Our only hope for seeing those prices fall is to increase domestic production. That won't happen overnight, but we have the resources; we just need the will. Overall, though, the feeling among American energy executives is that DeSantis is taking positive positions for national security and traditional energy producers. He prioritizes fossil fuel production, removing regulatory red tape and keeping the government out of industry decision-making over the pace and trajectory of the low-carbon transition. DeSantis\u2019 energy priorities reflect his concerns about the impact of energy cost inflation on Americans today rather than positioning the United States as a global leader in the fight against climate change. But he's also looking to take advantage of the economic and jobs opportunities offered by the diversification of the energy sector, focusing on critical minerals mining and a strategic reserve for these strategic resources.

    "description": "The exclusives Microsoft released for Xbox Series X/S this year have made 2023 feel like what 2020 should have felt like.",
    "content": "Even though we\u2019re almost three years into the life span of the Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S , it feels like this console generation is just starting for Microsoft. It\u2019s no secret that Xbox was slow to start up and then maintain consistency this console generation. For example, 2020 saw the company putting out a weak console launch lineup made up of ports and remasters. While 2021 had a flurry of great games, it was followed by a comparatively barren 2022. And 2023 hasn\u2019t been perfect either (due, in large part, to the flop that is Redfall ) , but outside of that, this year delivered the excellent Hi-Fi Rush , the grandly scaled Starfield , solid ports of two Age of Empires games and Quake II , a new Minecraft title, and a technical showpiece in Forza Motorsport . Recommended Videos Looking at that varied lineup, these games showcase both the potential of the Series X and the power of Xbox as a brand. Prospects for Xbox\u2019s lineup are up heading into 2024 too, so it feels like we\u2019re at the proper start of the Xbox Series X and S console generation \u2026 even if it came a few years too late. Related Baldur\u2019s Gate 3 drops Series S splitscreen support to release on Xbox in 2023 Xbox Games Showcase and Starfield Direct: how to watch and what to expect How many games featured in Xbox\u2019s 2022 showcase actually launched within 12 months? A new beginning Looking at the 2020 launch lineup for Xbox Series X/S, it wasn\u2019t exactly emblematic of what the console could do. While there were some nice 4K and 60 frames per second (fps) upgrades for Xbox One games, the only new draws were a console port of Gears Tactics , the multiplayer-supporting Tetris Effect: Connected , a temporary next-gen exclusive version of Yakuza: Like a Dragon , and some smaller indies like The Falconeer and Bright Memory 1.0 . Xbox Game Studios Most of those games were on or came to more platforms afterward and, in general, didn\u2019t provide that strong of an argument for why players should stick around this console generation. But looking at many of the games Xbox has released this year, it finally feels like we have a bundle of good Xbox exclusives that show what the platform was always capable of. In my review of Forza Motorsport , I note that the game feels like a launch title because it\u2019s an impressive technical showpiece. It runs at 4K and 60 fps in performance mode, which is something not many games this generation have done. The closest comparable games are Astro\u2019s Playroom and Marvel\u2019s Spider-Man Remastered on PlayStation 5, which effectively demonstrated the power of Sony\u2019s console early on. Forza Motorsport was also built as a platform that developer Turn 10 Studios can expand over time. It plans to periodically slot in new single and multiplayer content, including new cars and tracks. A game like that makes a lot of sense early on in a console\u2019s life span in this live-service era. It\u2019s what Microsoft tried to do with Halo Infinite , even if that didn\u2019t pan out as expected due to a one-year delay, and with Killer Instinct on Xbox One. Xbox Game Studios Then there\u2019s the matter of games that intrinsically feel next-gen in scope. While that\u2019s a much more nebulous feeling from person to person, the scale of a game like Starfield feels like something that wouldn\u2019t have worked or run as well on an Xbox One. It\u2019s a landmark, zeitgeisty first-party release that got the whole video game industry talking, which is something that Xbox has only managed to do a few times over the past decade and could have sorely used at the start of this console generation. On top of that, you\u2019ve got Hi-Fi Rush and Minecraft Legends as 2023 stand-ins for the typical quirkier launch titles, in line with games like Sackboy: A Big Adventure or Ryse: Son of Rome . The Age of Empires ports show unification between the PC and console publishing departments of Xbox. And it\u2019s also been a solid year for day-one Xbox Game Pass titles, with third-party games like Exoprimal and Lies of P hitting the subscription on launch day . It\u2019s perhaps the first time in nearly a decade that Xbox has seemed healthy on both the first-party and third-party fronts. Xbox Game Studios While it\u2019s impossible to say that Xbox has fully gotten its mojo back or that this is a definitive end to Microsoft\u2019s struggles, 2023 is still the first year where it has genuinely felt like the Series X vision is coming into focus. We\u2019ve gotten a comprehensive game lineup and reason to have faith in the viability of the future game lineup thanks to a packed summer showcase this June. It feels like a console launch year for Xbox. While that is a bit concerning as we\u2019re three years into these consoles\u2019 life spans, it hopefully is a sign that things will be better going forward, with Xbox truly rebounding after the lows of 2022 and Redfall . So, what does this feeling mean for players? For Xbox Series X and S owners, we finally are getting a sense of consistency and validation for the hardware we picked up, in some cases, almost three years ago. For those who don\u2019t own an Xbox system, it\u2019ll feel like the generation just started if you pick one up now and immediately download Forza Motorsport, Starfield , and Hi-Fi Rush . Editors' Recommendations You don\u2019t need an Xbox Series X to play Starfield.

    "description": "A new study finds an esketamine nasal spray achieved remission and prevented relapse of depression in patients with treatment-resistant depression.",
    "content": "A new study is offering more evidence in support of the former party drug in helping hard-to-treat depression. Depression is a , but an erstwhile party drug is projected to flip the narrative and improve the lives of those in desperate need. Over the last several years, \u2014 especially forms impervious to conventional treatment, known as treatment-resistant depression \u2014 by rewiring the brain, encouraging a phenomenon known as neuroplasticity. Currently, ketamine is only approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as an anesthetic; it isn\u2019t approved to treat any mental health conditions. But it\u2019s seeing off-label use in clinics offering intravenous infusions (often at a ), , and more recently, through nasal sprays. In 2019, the , an intranasal nasal spray containing esketamine, a molecule derived from the drug, based on clinical trials demonstrating its potency in not only treating but keeping treatment-resistant depression at bay. Now, a new study is offering more evidence in support of esketamine, positioning the nasal spray as even more effective than antidepressant medications like quetiapine, also known as Seroquel. In a clinical trial spanning 24 countries, among 336 participants already on an antidepressant, 28 percent saw remission of their symptoms after eight weeks on the esketamine nasal spray versus 18 percent of a similar-sized group taking quetiapine in addition to their usual antidepressants. After about 32 weeks, 22 percent of the esketamine remained in remission as opposed to 14 percent in the quetiapine group. Medical experts say these results are promising for patients with treatment-resistant depression, but more research is needed to see how truly effective the esketamine nasal spray is compared to other antidepressants \u2014 not just quetiapine \u2014 and whether the former party drug is safe for patients to take long-term. The in the . Lasting remission While a majority of individuals with depression will get better with conventional antidepressant medications, 10 to 30 percent don\u2019t respond to treatment at all. called the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (or STAR*D) study, those getting treatment for depression will generally enter remission (or return to normal levels of functioning) in a step-wise fashion: 30 percent after the first treatment, 50 percent after two treatments, 60 percent after three, and 70 percent after four. Studies show esketamine does seem to work pretty well when compared against a placebo for individuals with hard-to-treat depression, , director of the Center for Affective Disorders at King\u2019s College London, who co-led the study, tells . However, there hasn\u2019t been much data on how the esketamine nasal spray stacks up against other recognized, more affordable treatment options like quetiapine. Typically, ketamine is delivered as an intravenous infusion. To suss out how well it works against other treatments, 676 adults between 18 and 74 were recruited and screened from August 2020 to November 2021 across 24 countries. These were individuals with treatment-resistant depression already on an antidepressant \u2014 either a selective serotonin or serotonin-norepinephrine inhibitor. Participants were randomly put into two groups, but knew what they were getting: the esketamine sprayed up the nose twice a week in a health care setting or quetiapine taken daily. \u201cA very important thing of this study was to look at not only the people who got better but also stayed better over the course of 32 weeks,\u201d says Young. And that\u2019s what the researchers saw. After eight weeks of treatment, 28 percent of the esketamine group saw remission of their treatment-resistant depression, and 24 weeks after the initial treatment, 22 percent didn\u2019t relapse. (Whether someone was functioning back to normal was determined by the Montgomery-\u00c5sberg Depression Rating Scale, a 10-item clinician-rated scale used to assess the severity of depressive symptoms in those with mood disorders.) This is compared to 18 percent in the quetiapine group, 14 percent of whom didn\u2019t relapse after the same time period. Therapeutic potential with many questions , chief of psychiatry at Massachusetts General Hospital, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study, told in an email that the findings were in line with what many clinicians have come to expect with the efficacy of nasal esketamine for people with treatment-resistant depression. However, because the study was limited to comparing esketamine to quetiapine, it\u2019s hard to say how much better the nasal spray is compared to other drugs used for treatment-resistant depression. For , professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, who was also not involved in the study, there are concerns about how much the placebo effect may be at play during the course of the entire clinical trial, given participants knew what they were getting and the fact esketamine can only be administered in-person by a health care professional. \u201cThere\u2019s a big placebo effect of giving that much attention to a patient,\u201d he tells . He also mentions other factors at play, separate from the placebo effect. \u201cPeople get a little bit of high when they get [the esketamine nasal spray].\u201d While giving short-term doses of esketamine appears to be safe for patients, Anand says there\u2019s the issue of potential addiction associated with esketamine with prolonged use, which needs to be further investigated. Right now, it\u2019s not entirely clear how long esketamine can keep depressive symptoms at bay. Young says when treating severe or recurrent depression with conventional antidepressants, a patient would need to remain on medication for about six months although this can be as long as two years. He believes this could be the same for nasal esketamine. Like ketamine infusions, esketamine nasal sprays aren\u2019t cheap, but they may be more cost-effective, . As millions of people around the world suffer from depression, the hope remains for esketamine to revolutionize the way we approach mental health care.",

    "content": "A toxic cocktail of damaging chemicals created by road pollution is flowing into England\u2019s rivers and no regulator is monitoring the scale of its impact on wildlife or public health. More than 18,000 outfalls, such as pipes, and about 7,700 soakaways managed by National Highways discharge rainwater potentially contaminated with heavy metals, hydrocarbons, microplastics and other chemicals from the main road network into rivers and on to land. Last month, National Highways reported it had assessed its discharge points and found 1,236 outfalls and soakaways had \u201ca potential high risk of pollution\u201d. Of these, \u201c145 have a verified high risk of pollution and require mitigation\u201d while the remaining 1,091 had a \u201cpotential high risk\u201d of \u201cpolluting the water environment\u201d. runoff map Analysis by the Guardian and Watershed Investigations of hundreds of these sites reveals that about 70 are located in areas that are legally protected for important habitats or wildlife, and about 250 are within 1km (0.6 miles) of a protected site. Hundreds more discharge to rivers and land with no formal protection. Despite urban and transport pollution accounting for 18% of England\u2019s water bodies failing to meet good ecological standards, highways outfalls are not regulated under environmental permitting regulations, which means there is less scrutiny and no monitoring in place. Guy Linley-Adams, a solicitor at the charity Wildfish, said: \u201cThe Environment Agency has the power to bring highways drains and discharges under environmental permitting if they involve \u2018the discharge or entry to inland freshwaters, coastal waters or relevant territorial waters of any \u2026 poisonous, noxious or polluting matter\u2019. \u201cThat would certainly appear to be the case here, so the agency must show that it has considered the problem and explain why it has not yet, to our knowledge, required permits that limit pollution of rivers from, at the very least, the higher risk discharges that have been identified by National Highways. \u201cIt is no good just saying: \u2018We don\u2019t know how big this problem is.\u2019 Put simply, the agency has a duty to find out.\u201d National Highways said it did not routinely monitor runoff because the results varied depending on rainfall and river flows, and because it would not be practical or good value. It had instead developed a predictive tool to determine scenarios where the risk of impacts on water quality were unacceptably high. The lack of monitoring makes it impossible to understand the scale of the pollution but it is also hampered by lack of knowledge over the total number of outfalls across the country. Jo Bradley, a former Environment Agency officer who runs the Stormwater Shepherds not-for-profit, said: \u201cNational Highways operates 3% of the road network and they have over 25,000 outfalls and soakaways. Imagine how many there are across the entire road network. The number of these outfalls dwarfs the 15,000 storm sewer overflows, and perhaps the impact of the pollution is worse.\u201d Ten potentially high-risk outfalls drain runoff from the M27 bridge into the River Hamble conservation area, which flows into the Solent. Some of England\u2019s rare and fragile chalk streams are also under threat from runoff; the M1 discharges into the River Colne, near Watford, and runoff from the M3 flows into the River Itchen, in Hampshire, which is home to salmon, brown trout, grayling and otters. A cluster of 24 outfalls surround the River Kennet chalk stream area and its tributaries near Reading. Official data shows the river system has high levels of heavy metals and hydrocarbons, which are associated with road runoff. Charlotte Hitchmough, the director of Action for the River Kennet, said: \u201cThe people responsible for highway drainage actively encourage the disposal of polluted rain water straight into the river, even rivers that have the highest levels of legal environmental protection. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Down to Earth Free weekly newsletter The planet's most important stories.

In urban areas this is a perennial problem. Every summer we experience fish kills in those rivers where there are fish remaining.\u201d Fish are not the only species under threat. Prof Andrew Johnson, from the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, said persistent and bioaccumulative chemicals such as PAHs could reach the ocean, \u201cin which case we start to worry about animals such as cetaceans [dolphins, porpoises and whales]\u201d. However, he said the risk was hard to determine because the chemical loads were unknown. An Environment Agency spokesperson said outfalls and road drains were \u201cnot directly regulated by the Environment Agency but we do work with the government and partner organisations to reduce pollution from roads. This includes working closely with National Highways to influence their road investment strategy to include pollution mitigating schemes on their priority list of outfalls.\u201d Stephen Elderkin, the director of environmental sustainability at National Highways, said: \u201cWe are committed to addressing all of our high-risk water outfalls by 2030 and our water quality plan 2030 sets out a high-level programme of work to achieve this \u2026 National Highways has also invested in a programme of research to understand the risk of pollution from microplastics in road runoff.\u201d Under National Highways\u2019 plan, four outfalls have confirmed funding for mitigation this year, and \u201c17 outfalls and soakaways have been identified for potential delivery in 2024-25\u201d. Dr Sue Young, the head of land use planning at the Wildlife Trusts, said it was \u201chugely concerning that National Highways doesn\u2019t actually know the scale of the problem, and despite having identified over a thousand potentially polluting outfalls, it is mitigating just four of these this year. It\u2019s hard to see, with this snail\u2019s pace of action, how they will resolve this toxic issue by 2030. \u201cNature is in crisis now, with one in seven species in the UK at risk of extinction. We believe the next road investment strategy should allocate funding to act with greater ambition to stop this pollution now, rather than allowing most sites to continue putting this toxic mix into our most vulnerable rivers and streams until almost the end of the decade.\u201d",

Gold bars and stacks of cash: how Bob Menendez ended up charged with bribery Read more The New Jersey senator temporarily stepped down from his powerful position as chairman of the Senate foreign relations committee in September after he was indicted by federal prosecutors in New York on corruption charges, including allegations that he accepted cash bribes and gold bars in exchange for breaching his duties \u201cin ways that benefited the government of Egypt\u201d. Menendez pleaded not guilty to the allegations and has resisted calls for his resignation, including from fellow Democrats. Among former senior US officials and some Egyptian dissidents, one accusation included in the indictment against the senator stands out: that in May 2018, Menendez procured details from the state department about the number and nationalities of people working at the US embassy in Cairo, one of the largest US missions in the Middle East. Menendez is accused of passing this information to Egyptian officials, via his partner, Nadine Menendez, and a New Jersey businessman, Wael Hanna, who recently pleaded not guilty to charges that he bribed the senator. Menendez, Nadine Menendez and Hanna have all denied wrongdoing. The indictment states that \u201calthough this information was not classified, it was deemed highly sensitive because it could pose significant operational security concerns if disclosed to a foreign government or if made public\u201d. The FBI has also reportedly opened a counterintelligence investigation related to the charges. \u201cIf the allegation is true, this is reprehensible. One of the worst aspects of this is that it\u2019s not only selling influence, it\u2019s really putting people\u2019s lives in jeopardy,\u201d said a former high-ranking state department official who worked across the Middle East, including Egypt. \u201cI\u2019d label this charge in the indictment a betrayal of trust,\u201d said Gordon Gray, a former diplomat with 35 years in the foreign service whose postings included ambassador to Tunisia, senior adviser to the US ambassador to Iraq and deputy chief of mission in Cairo. \u201cOur Egyptian employees \u2026 work for us under potentially high risk to themselves and their families.\u201d It\u2019s also a betrayal of trust of the US government writ large to protect its people Former diplomat Gordon Gray He added: \u201cIt\u2019s also a betrayal of trust of the US government writ large to protect its people.\u201d The state department declined to respond to questions about the impact of the apparent leak or whether it was providing additional security to individuals who may have been compromised. US personnel with knowledge of the Egyptian security state have long understood the specific risks facing diplomats based in Cairo \u2013 and that those working at the embassy, particularly Egyptian nationals, were likely to be the target of surveillance by Egyptian intelligence. Such fears sharply increased after the 2013 military coup that brought Egyptian president Abdel-Fatah al-Sisi to power, which spurred a resurgence in the power of Egyptian intelligence bodies. For the US embassy in Cairo, the arrest and detention of staffer Ahmed Aleiba a year later was a watershed moment. Reporting in Egyptian pro-government media suggested that Aleiba, an Egyptian national, was detained and transferred to the custody of an Egyptian intelligence body after accusations that he had coordinated meetings between US officials and the Muslim Brotherhood, a banned group. Pressure on foreign missions has also extended to those who meet with diplomats: in 2020, two employees of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights, a prominent human rights organisation, were detained by security forces after hosting a meeting for a group of western diplomats at their offices in Cairo. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to First Thing Free daily newsletter Our US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it matters Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Following Menendez\u2019s indictment, acting foreign relations committee chairman Ben Cardin as well as members of Congress moved to block a further $235m, the maximum possible amount, until Egypt\u2019s record on human rights improves. Others said that while the information on embassy staff that Menendez allegedly passed to Egyptian officials was subject to constant change, it was valuable because Egyptian intelligence would have been able to compare it to other data secured through surveillance, to gauge which members of the embassy could be employees of US intelligence organisations and target Egyptian staff working there long term. \u201cThe Egyptian government wouldn\u2019t just be relying on Menendez for information like this \u2013 obviously they have their own sources and methods of how to source it, including visas, passports and counting the numbers,\u201d said Ben Fishman, a former member of the US national security council overseeing north Africa and Jordan. Referring to the allegations in the indictment, he added: \u201cBeing willing to convey that information and forward it on is, in my view, inappropriate for a senator.\u201d Gray pointed to how Egyptians employed at the embassy are particularly vulnerable to intimidation by local security forces. \u201cThe pressures that the locally engaged staff face are always on the mind of US embassies, at least US embassies in non-democracies,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t have diplomatic immunity, and their families are there. It can be a much more precarious situation for them.\u201d One US-based Egyptian dissident said the Egyptian government would be aware of Egyptians staffing the US embassy in Cairo, and believed there were likely already informants who work for Egypt inside the embassy. But he said the alleged sharing of sensitive and non-public information, as described in the indictment, meant that Egypt gained another, highly reliable, source of information about embassy employees. \u201cIt would have been seen as a definitive list,\u201d the person said.",

    "description": "With the blockbuster success of the \"Barbie\" movie and the related expansion of Barbie branding and merchandising, educators and parents may find themselves wondering about Barbie's original purpose: as a child's toy.",
    "content": "October 5, 2023 This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies . Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility: fact-checked trusted source written by researcher(s) proofread by Ozlem Cankaya, The Conversation With the blockbuster success of the \"Barbie\" movie and the related expansion of Barbie branding and merchandising , educators and parents may find themselves wondering about Barbie's original purpose: as a child's toy. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1449240174198-2'); }); Barbie has become an icon since her introduction in 1959 . On the positive side, dolls like Barbie can serve as a canvas for imaginative storytelling and role-playing . Children often create elaborate scenarios, dialogs and relationships among their dolls, and they refer to the thoughts, emotions and desires of themselves and others while playing, supporting language and emotional development . Dolls often act as catalysts for children to explore different roles (or careers) and social scenarios, potentially encouraging aspirations and broadening horizons. Additionally, Barbie play can promote fine motor skills as children dress and accessorize the dolls. Dolls can also facilitate social interaction when shared with peers or caregivers. However, there is a potential downside. Barbie dolls come with predefined appearances and characteristics, which can limit the range of narratives a child may explore. There is also marketing of an entire \"Barbie world\" of branded objects , which many parents may choose not to invest in for financial or environmental reasons. In the face of consumer pressures, while also being mindful of educational aspects of play, parents or caregivers can consider integrating open-ended everyday objects and versatile toys into children's play with Barbie or other commercially successful toys. This is a rewarding approach that promotes growth, creative thinking , adaptability and a sense of wonder. While Mattel, the maker of Barbie, today features Barbies featuring multiple skin tones, hairstyles and body types , the original Barbie may reinforce certain stereotypes, particularly related to whiteness and gender roles . And while the Barbie brand has evolved, many unfortunate decisions were made historically. For example, in 2014 Mattel apologized after readers complained about a book where Barbie as a computer engineer waited for males to save the day from computer difficulties . Mattel's release of Teen Talk Barbie in 1992 sparked controversy due to a particular phrase: \"Math class is tough!\" The phrase perpetuates the stereotype that struggling with math is expected or even normal. The doll inadvertently contributed to a culture that discourages girls from pursuing mathematics and other STEM fields , reinforced gender biases and perpetuated misconceptions that can have far-reaching consequences on children's educational choices and career aspirations. When children play with dolls and toys, they are not just having fun, but also absorbing messages and attitudes from their playthings. Researchers name play in early childhood as one of the powerful early influences on later gendered outcomes . The choice of toys and play materials can contribute to how adults reinforce gendered patterns and habits, encouraging boys and girls to develop different interests and skills. For example, psychology researchers Emily F. Coyle and Lynn Liben explored the impact of gendered toy packaging in five-year-old children's STEM play with their mothers. Mothers and their child (31 daughters; 30 sons) were randomly assigned to play with a mechanical toy packaged for girls (GoldieBlox) or boys (BobbyBlox). They discovered children's independent play varied with game packaging. When preparing for the play, mothers who were provided BobbyBlox built more toy pieces than those given the GoldieBlox. Also, mothers built more with their sons, whereas they focused more on reading the toy's instructions with their daughters. Further exploration of young children's early STEM play patterns may effectively influence later outcomes. Encouraging children to modify and personalize their play experience in a variety of ways can mitigate some of the stereotypical gender-specific effects of Barbie-like dolls . Repurposing common materials to craft intricate settings and props, children are empowered to envision boundless scenarios. Creative fusion allows children to transform ordinary items into extraordinary elements within Barbie's world. For example: The personalized aspect of using everyday materials to create accessories or outfits for dolls, or combining toys to allow for envisioning new worlds, fosters a sense of autonomy in children and instills a sense of ownership and pride in their creations. As children engage in collaborative play and work together to construct shared goals, they practice communication, teamwork and negotiation. Using ordinary items also nurtures an early awareness of environmental consciousness in children, teaching them the value of repurposing materials, reducing waste\u2014and the wondrous capacity of imaginative play.

    "content": "to get the biggest news straight to your inbox 2023 continues to be a difficult year when it comes to layoffs. In the past couple of weeks alone, companies including , , , , , , , , and have all dismissed varying numbers of staff, ranging from 10 Hearthstone developers to more than 800 Epic employees. The reasons for these redundancies can vary. Crystal Dynamics and Beamdog, for example, were which also resulted in the closure of studios such as . Meanwhile the Keywords layoffs reported today are a consequence of . But when job cuts make headlines so frequently in such a short space of time, it's easy to see there are wider issues at work. reached out to a range of analysts, recruiters and investors, who all cite myriad factors that are a sign of the current economic climate: high interest rates, inflation, slowed growth, rising production costs, and increased competition (to name but a few). These challenges are not unique to gaming, as indicated by the widespread layoffs at major tech firms like Microsoft, Meta and Amazon. \"In gaming, the significance of 'efficiency' has risen dramatically over the last 18 months,\" Kantan Games CEO Serkan Toto tells us. \"There is a much higher sense of urgency now to save costs and run slimmer organisations. The pressure is on for game industry CEOs to pull out the hammer and handle the biggest cost block of them all, namely staff. And this is what we have seen in 2023. \"All this happens under a sense of 'If we don't do it, our competitors will and then eliminate us on efficiency,' and people get fired left and right at the moment. There is also the phenomenon that often CEOs think 15% to 20% of their people are redundant anyway at any point in time.\" Hiro Capital partner Spike Laurie believes you can trace the current wave(s) of layoffs to one in particular: Elon Musk cutting 50% of Twitter's workforce in November 2022. \"He had figured out from people's electronic passes that there were more people serving food in the cafeteria than actually there to eat it,\" he says. \"This was the impetus other business leaders needed in order to start looking carefully at the size of their companies and start making judicious cuts. Why? We have come to the end of an economic cycle, fuelled by an addiction to cheap and readily available cash. \"A year later, we're seeing cuts in the games industry workforce and many good, talented people losing their jobs and financial security. This is made more painful for those affected by the high cost of basic goods like energy and food.\" Widespread layoffs are made all the more galling by what IDG Consulting's SVP of consulting Emilie Avera describes as a \"glaring disparity\" between executive and non-executive compensation, particularly in publicly traded companies. \"While measures like contractor and employee layoffs effectively reduce overhead costs and momentarily boost the appearance of balance sheets, there's an evident lack of comparable reduction in total compensation packages for executives,\" she says. She continues: \"When it comes to executive compensation, the current imperative is a robust 'pay-for-performance' model, where executive boards strictly enforce benchmarks for the upper echelons of management. Their compensation should be tied to tangible outcomes and performance metrics, with compensation adjusted downwards if the set targets aren't met.\" The pandemic inevitably factors into the current state of the market, too. Avera observes that the games industry expanded dramatically while stay-at-home measures were in place, but this was never going to last. \"As money started to dry out, firms were forced to reassess the ways funds were allocated, with layoffs emerging as an immediate solution to cut expenses,\" she explains. \"The short-term vision of chasing aggressive growth, often at the expense of sustainable profitability was exacerbated by investors \u2014 lured by the promise of rapid returns, many pursued hasty acquisitions, often without sufficient diligence paired with poor budget management. This frantic approach, driven partly by a 'fear of missing out,' had the unintended effect of bruising the industry they had aimed to prop up.\" Avera compares this to the entertainment sector, where streaming platforms prioritised audience expansion over profitability. Just as the streaming space is now recalibrating by increasing prices to \"mend their unsustainable model,\" the games industry is going through \"a comparable reckoning.\" \"The pace of growth for the games industry has peaked. It will keep growing, but mostly driven by increasing population and better internet connectivity, rather than by strengthening fundamentals of the business\" Liz Prince, head of recruitment specialist Amiqus, says that from a hiring perspective, the current situation is more of a recalibration than a deep-seated industry issue that warrants serious concern. \"Firstly, I'd like to express my compassion for all those affected by the recent layoffs and studio closures,\" she says. \"These times are undoubtedly challenging, and it's deeply unsettling to see talented individuals in our industry facing job losses. \"Every sector undergoes cycles of expansion and retraction, and what we're seeing looks to be a post-COVID realignment. As we know, during the pandemic there was a huge surge in games and this sudden boom led to studios scaling up swiftly, making acquisitions, and perhaps some over-investment in certain areas. Now some studios need to readjust. But it's worth noting that while certain studios are facing challenges, there are many others that are expanding.\" Ampere Analysis' head of games research Piers Harding-Rolls agrees: \"This is nothing new, especially in tougher economic times, although the scale of big budget games development today means that when a project gets cancelled, this can lead to hundreds of layoffs and that means a broader impact than in the past. \"It wasn't long ago that a major talking point of the industry was talent shortage. Key positions within studios were going unfilled and competition between companies for talent was intense. For bigger companies, this was part of the strategic rationale behind many of the acquisitions that took place between 2019 and early 2022.\" He adds that the M&A spree during the past few years was also fuelled by \"lofty games company valuations\" that peaked during the pandemic, and the availability of cheap debt. However, debt is now considerably more expensive and company valuations have fallen since Microsoft first announced its record-breaking proposed purchase of Activision Blizzard. Laurie is also unsurprised by the recalibration and companies resorting to layoffs, noting that many have been housing \"large, unprofitable teams.\" \"For a while, at peak hype, there were too many games being made by too many new teams, funded by cheap money and by the temporary boom in venture capital financing,\" he explains. \"Funds were pouring money into untested blockchain and metaverse studios, driving up wages but often not providing the studios enough runway to launch a game.\" Avera adds another factor: consumers are buying fewer games and spending more time with select franchises, a trend likely to accelerate as the market continues to shift towards live service titles. Even single-player titles are demanding more of players' time, with Avera noting that some of the biggest recent hits, including Baldur's Gate 3 and Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, take 50 or more hours simply to get through the main story. \"These lengthy games, combined with a labor/talent shortage among developers, engineers and designers, place immense pressure on an industry striving to capture as much mindshare as possible from a discerning gaming audience,\" she says. Kim Parker-Adcock, owner of recruitment agency One Player Mission, adds that consumers' spending habits have broadened again in the wake of lockdowns: \"People are spending what disposable income they have on going out, holidays abroad, events and so on. You will still get the die-hard gamers spending every spare dime on games but a lot less can afford a luxury item that might also require buying new hardware to play them i.e. latest consoles. Sony's recent exclusives are no longer being released on PS4, so you'll have to fork out \u00a3400+ for a PS5, too.\" Midia Research co-founder and senior analyst Karol Severin adds: \"The pace of growth for the games industry has peaked. The industry will keep growing in dollar terms, but it is mostly going to be driven by increasing population and better internet connectivity, rather than by strengthening fundamentals of the games business. While in-game spending will still grow, so will games subscriptions. And as cloud gaming subscriptions grow, there will be less of a need to buy high price point individual games. \"The games industry is about to see similar pressures as the music and video industries saw when streaming subscriptions truly took off. There will, of course, be many differences in how these dynamics will play out, but the fact that the value of an individual game in consumers' eyes will decline is inevitable. As such there will be a need for fewer games, therefore fewer developers and publishers.\" \"Every sector undergoes cycles of expansion and retraction, and what we're seeing looks to be a post-COVID realignment... While certain studios face challenges, many others are expanding Severin adds that the number of games released is growing significantly faster than global games revenue; for example, he says, Steam is tracking to have seen more than 13,500 games in 2023, compared to 12,500 last year. There is also the added issue of companies whose business models aren't necessarily dependent on games (such as Netflix, Amazon and Apple) increasingly grabbing for more market share. In terms of what the industry can do going forward, Avera has a series of suggestions. For example, she believes generative AI could be used to assist (but not replace) overburdened development teams and reduce total development time, and predicts that more companies will turn to outsourcers such as Keywords and Virtuos for services such as art, engineering, audio and more so their in-house teams can focus on their core strengths. User-generated content could also be a way to trim development costs, although she acknowledges there are imperfections in this business model, citing the public scrutiny over Roblox and its revenue-sharing models. But ultimately, Avera believes the industry needs to address its expectations. \"Righting the ship will require gaming companies and investors to agree on and adhere to realistic KPIs,\" she says. \"While positive sentiment around a game on social media platforms is heartening, it does not necessarily correlate with solid sales. Tangible metrics such as review scores, pre-sales, and proven track records of releasing games with minimal bugs should be appraised when making investment decisions.\" She adds: \"It's undeniable that some studios may experience further financial strain, and additional course corrections \u2014 including new layoffs \u2014 might be forthcoming. Yet these adjustments, however painful in the short term, are necessary steps toward ensuring a sustainable future for the gaming industry.\" Severin adds that there is no silver bullet, since so many of the factors behind these layoffs are out of the industry's control: inflation, interest rates, and so on. \"The games industry was staffed and invested for overdrive success and is simply correcting to a more natural/profitable equilibrium now,\" he says. \"Though much of the above sounds like doom and gloom, this industry isn't going anywhere \u2013 it will still be worth approximately $187 billion this year. For games companies thinking of future projects, carefully planning routes to profitability over user growth will become increasingly important. Also, we see increasingly more success in the future for games that focus on capturing and serving enthusiastic niches, rather than competing for mass audiences.\" Toto warns that these layoffs are not about to ease off anytime soon, adding: \"There are still studios in the market that seem to be overstaffed, looking at them from the outside. My guess is we will see further bad news through 2024.\" Prince assures those affected by these and future layoffs that their skills and expertise are \"still very much in demand,\" noting that there are still plenty of studios looking for talent. Similarly, Parker-Adcock notes that the downsizing of studios often leads to new ones opening doors. \"Whilst these [new] studios are still growing, it's [key] to make sure they don't overspend to ensure their survival and again only hiring for critical roles. I don't see much changing until the new year once the industry has seen what sales have been like for their Christmas releases.\" Laurie concludes by observing that the future may \"superficially look challenging\" but the growth of the industry with Gen Z rising and games technologies being adopted by big tech firms like Meta and Apple means there is still cause for optimism. \"Now is the time for talented individuals to use the incredible suite of tools available to them to build fun and engaging experiences for people to enjoy,\" he says. \"If this round of layoffs in the industry is the catalyst people need to build new games in a leaner, more efficient and creative way, we are all richer for it. \"We must remember how lucky we are to work in such a flourishing industry. When the macroeconomic climate improves, games will inevitably be at the forefront of driving new growth and jobs. Our skills will be deeply valuable in the new forward looking digital economy.\" to get the biggest news straight to your inbox",

    "description": "Mahomes is on pace to set a career-high in rushing yards",
    "content": "' passing numbers have looked a bit different this year, as he's only on pace to throw for 4,276 yards and 34 touchdowns. These numbers -- along with a 92.0 passer rating -- are considered low for Mahomes as he's still finding ways for the to win football games despite not having to play at an MVP level every week. With the passing game not as strong as in years past, Mahomes has turned to his legs to generate yards for the Chiefs. Through four games, Mahomes has 23 carries for 154 yards, a career high of 38.5 rushing yards per game. \"I'd probably just say more coverage. I haven't had a lot of pressure yet. I mean I'll obviously probably get some more this week,\" Mahomes said to reporters Wednesday, via a Chiefs transcript. \"They're playing a lot more coverage and dropping deep into coverages, and so it's opened lanes for me to scramble. That's something that I've always done. It just usually happens later in the season more than early, so (I'm) just trying to do whatever to go out there and win.\" The rushing yards average (38.5) easily surpasses Mahomes' previous career-high of 22.4 rushing yards per game, set in the 2021 season. Mahomes has never rushed for more than 381 yards in a season, but is on pace to shatter that mark. At this rate, Mahomes will have 655 rushing yards in 2023 -- more than he had in his first two full seasons as a starter combined (2018-2019). Mahomes isn't or running the football, but it's a part of his game defenses have to respect. His primary read is to throw the football, yet he'll take off to move the chains if necessary. \"I think what makes those dudes so great is that they can throw the football, too. I just have to be able to throw the football and then whenever the opportunity comes, just get enough yards to keep the chains moving,\" Mahomes said. \" I'm just trying to move the chains, and obviously, I want to throw for it. I want to make the throws, but when the opportunity arises, just \u2013 if I'm going to take it, make sure I go get the first down. \"It's just something you have to balance throughout the season is when to run for it, when to slide, when to throw the football and try to find ways to win games.\" Until the pass offense is able to make plays consistently, Mahomes is going to use his legs as an advantage to keep the offense on the field. The Chiefs' record hasn't been affected by the added dimension Mahomes has put in his game.",

    "content": "The co-leaders in both the SEC East and the SEC West meet up during the Week 6 college football schedule. In the East, No. 20 goes to Athens to take on top-ranked , and the Bulldogs are 14.5-point favorites in the latest Week 6 college football odds via the SportsLine consensus. It's expected to be a tighter matchup in the 3:30 p.m. ET SEC on CBS matchup when hosts No. 11 (-2.5). There's also a SEC crossover matchup between ranked teams as No. 21 hosts No. 23 (-6.5). Other Week 6 college football spreads of note around the nation include No. 3 (-6.5) vs. No. 12 in the 2023 Red River Showdown, No. 10 at No. 25 (+6.5), and No. 4 hosting (+19.5). Before locking in any Week 6 college football picks on those games or others, be sure to . Sallee is a true insider -- a CBS Sports analyst, SiriusXM host, Heisman voter and consistently one of the top CBS Sports experts picking games against the spread. He debuted with SportsLine in 2017 and has delivered his three best to members each week. Now, he has turned his attention to the Week 6 and is sharing his top three best bets over at SportsLine. If you parlay them together, you could be looking at a return of around 6-1. . One of Sallee's top Week 6 college football picks: He's taking No. 17 (-20.5) to cover against in an 8 p.m. ET kickoff on Saturday. Georgia Tech had one of the worst losses among Power Five teams in Week 5, giving up 38 unanswered points and ultimately falling 38-27 to , a MAC squad that entered that game winless against FBS competition. Miami, meanwhile, is cruising with a 4-0 straight-up record and three covers in as many tries against FBS competition this year. \"Their perfect season will continue this weekend against a wretched Yellow Jackets squad,\" Sallee told SportsLine. \"The Jackets haven't found their offensive identity, and Miami's defense has created chaos in every game this season. Even if this game is close for a half -- which is unlikely -- Miami will pull away in the second half for an easy cover.\" . Sallee has also found two other college football picks he loves, including backing a Group of Five underdog that he says can not only cover, but win outright. .",

    "description": "Levi's: From Fashion Icon to Corporate Distress \u2013 A Tale of Ups and Downs in the Denim Business. Can it find a new vision for the future?",
    "content": "Forbes Money Investing The Distressed Look At Levi Strauss Is In The Corporate Suite Who Are Lacking Vision Greg Petro Contributor Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own. Following Oct 5, 2023, 01:01pm EDT | Press play to listen to this article! Got it! Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin The Distressed Look at Levi Strauss is in the Corporate Suite Who are Lacking Vision getty In the fickle business of fashion, the popularity of denim has ebbed and flowed over the years, and likewise, the fortunes of Levi Strauss. This venerable brand invented blue jeans in 1873. Just two years ago, Levi\u2019s was riding high, sporting a market capitalization of $12 billion in May 2021, up from about $6 billion just two years earlier when it went public. For over three decades before that, Levi\u2019s had been a struggling, privately held company whose core audience was aging out. Today, the company is worth about $5.3 billion, less than half what it was in 2021 when consumers were spending all that pandemic stimulus money to trade up and look good in Levi\u2019s. The stock price has fallen from a high of about $29 a share to where it is today, about $13.50. Since 2021, the company seems to have again lost its way under CEO Chip Bergh, a former US Army captain recruited in 2011 as group president for global grooming at Procter & Gamble. After working his way up the ranks over nearly three decades, Bergh has said he left P&G when he realized he would not be a candidate for P&G\u2019s CEO. So, rather than the fashion maven that Levi\u2019s needed, the company\u2019s board picked Bergh, an ambitious corporate executive responsible for such brands as Tampax and Gillette. The problem at Levi\u2019s is not their distressed jeans; it\u2019s distress in the C-suite. In the quarter ended June 30, the company posted a $1.6 million loss compared with nearly $50 million a year earlier. The company is now a consumer retail laggard. Anyone who follows fashion industry trends as closely as I do might have predicted Levi\u2019s recent problems. For me, it was when I noticed that Bergh showed up at virtually every industry event and conference wearing an astonishing outfit for how out of step it is with the current culture \u2013 the so-called \u201cCanadian Tuxedo\u201d: denim jacket and jeans. Who wears denim jackets today? I thought this was a fashion exec out of step with the fashion market. Furthermore, as inflation-wary consumers trade down to save money, Levi\u2019s is losing to Walmart, Target, Tractor Supply, and other retailers expanding their private label lines at prices Levi\u2019s can\u2019t, won\u2019t, or shouldn\u2019t match.

At some point, skinny jeans on bulky bodies stop looking sexy. The trend is evident these days: jeans buyers are looking for room in their pants, wider legs, and stretchy materials. Skinny jeans may be dead, but as things stand, not the future of denim. The distress in Levi\u2019s corporate ranks may not be over. As part of a succession plan announced late last year, Bergh was recently to be replaced by Michelle Gass, the former chief executive of department store chain Kohl\u2019s. Gass takes over a company whose retail website promotes heavily discounted merchandise, and a whole section of denim jackets and other tops is a product category outside of its expertise (one exception: the trucker jacket). Last year, the company spent $400 million to buy Beyond Yoga, which focuses on activewear and body-positive apparel \u2013 think stretch pants. They have a wide array of \u201cWestern\u201d tops, and one would argue a complete lack of product vision. The bottom line: Levi\u2019s has lost its fashion sense and any product vision. The company seems to be clinging to the past, a past that belongs to a fashion cohort that is more concerned with getting in and out of their cars without having to hold their breath than looking sexy and having spoken to several friends and colleagues about what the first thing that crosses their minds when asked about Levi\u2019s? Their response was, \u201cThe past\u201d. Levi\u2019s needs a make-over. A vision. New ideas for a future, not a past. Check out my website .

    "description": "Atoms within the enormous ball of iron in Earth's inner core may move around much more than previously thought, which could explain recent findings about the core's surprising softness.",
    "content": "Scientists recently discovered that 's inner core, which was long thought to be an unmoving ball of solid metal, might be a lot less rigid than we expected. Now, a new study suggests this surprising softness may be caused by hyperactive that move around within their molecular structure much more than we realized. The inner core is a massive spherical lump of metal, predominantly iron, that spans roughly 760 miles (1,220 kilometers) and . The inner core is enveloped by the outer core \u2014 a sea of swirling liquid metals \u2014 that is in turn surrounded by a massive layer of molten rock, known as the mantle, which sits just below the solid crust we live on. The pressure at the heart of our planet is immense, so experts initially believed the core must be completely solid and that the iron atoms within it, which are arranged in a massive hexagonal lattice, must be permanently held in place. But in 2021, seismic waves from earthquakes , which led some scientists to describe it as a \"mushy hidden world.\" Subsequent studies suggested this or that the core exists in a \"superionic state,\" where atoms from other elements like carbon and hydrogen are . The new study, published Oct. 2 in the journal , provides an alternative explanation for what is going on inside the inner core. The researchers recreated the intense pressure within the inner core in the lab and observed how the iron atoms behaved under these conditions. The scientists then fed this data into a computer-learning program to create a simulated virtual core that they dubbed the \"supercell.\" Using the supercell, the team was able to see how the iron atoms moved within their supposedly rigid structure. The results suggest the atoms inside the inner core can \"move much more than we ever imagined,\" study co-author , a geophysicist at the University of Texas at Austin, said in a . The supercell simulations show that some of these atoms can move around in groups, taking up other positions in the lattice without compromising its overall shape \u2014 kind of like how dinner guests change seats at a table without adding or removing chairs, researchers wrote in the statement. This type of movement is known as \"collective motion.\" \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \"This increased movement makes the inner core less rigid [and] weaker against shear forces,\" Lin said. This could explain why the inner core is \"surprisingly soft,\" he added. The researchers believe that the new findings could also reveal new insights into other inner core mysteries, like how it helps to generate . \"Now, we know about the fundamental mechanism that will help us with understanding the dynamic processes and evolution of the Earth's inner core,\" Lin said.",

He characterizes McCarthy as a conservative who had at least some interest in actually governing, but is now set to be replaced with a hardliner who will be even more difficult to work with. Writing in the Washington Post , Bloomberg says: McCarthy\u2019s failure to reach out to Democrats was inexcusable, of course. But so too was Jeffries\u2019 failure to extend an olive branch. Not only has it empowered the Republicans\u2019 extreme right wing, but it also squandered an opportunity for Democrats to increase their influence. Jeffries had a chance to use the crisis to push for a more bipartisan governing model in the House, one that would have given Democrats more involvement in crafting legislation and conducting oversight. It could have been a transformative moment for Congress and the country. But if any informal Democratic overture occurred, it was too little, too late. It\u2019s true that McCarthy gave no indication he would have had the good sense to accept a serious peace offering by Jeffries. But even if he had rejected it, Democrats could have shown voters that at least one party in Washington is serious about finding common ground. Their failure to make a peace offering falls heaviest on the party\u2019s moderates, who speak of bipartisanship but, when push comes to shove, don\u2019t practice it. Now, with the House paralyzed, not only is Congress failing to do the people\u2019s business, but aid to Ukraine has been indefinitely paused, helping Russia\u2019s war effort and costing people their lives. \u201cThere has to be an adult in the room,\u201d McCarthy said over the weekend, after keeping the government from shutting down with the help of Democrats. He was right. Sadly, in the end, neither he nor Jeffries could do the adult thing, by reaching across the aisle to prevent Congress from sinking even deeper into dysfunction. 18m ago 17.59 BST Biden says border wall won't work, but law required construction Joe Biden explained that his administration was moving forward with building a wall on the US border with Mexico because federal law required it \u2013 even though he does not believe it will work. Here are comments he made to the press from the Oval Office: President Biden defends moving to build border barriers in a portion of the Rio Grande Valley, saying funding was already appropriated and he \u201ccan't stop that\u201d despite asking Congress to redirect the money. Asked if he thinks the border wall works, Biden says \u201cNo.\u201d pic.twitter.com/U9dRRl4Lbk \u2014 The Recount (@therecount) October 5, 2023 Environmental advocates are furious with Biden for waiving federal laws in order to move forward with the construction, even though his own administration said in its early days in office that such a barrier would not be effective. Here\u2019s the latest on this story: Biden criticized for waiving 26 laws in Texas to allow border wall construction Read more 35m ago 17.42 BST For a sense of how the GOP is trying to spin this week\u2019s theatrics in the House, take a look at this tweet from the National Republican Congressional Committee, which is tasked with winning seats in the chamber: Extreme House Democrats are the Chaos Caucus. pic.twitter.com/SDtxWqdKg3 \u2014 NRCC (@NRCC) October 5, 2023 All the Democrats you see there represent swing or red districts, and many won re-election only narrowly last year, when Joe Biden \u2019s allies overperformed expectations thanks to factors like the downfall of Roe v Wade and successful warnings about GOP extremism. The Democratic caucus was unanimous in voting to oust Kevin McCarthy , arguing that they were merely keeping with the common practice of the minority party in the House refusing to support the majority\u2019s choice for speaker. 54m ago 17.23 BST Trump considering visit to Capitol to meet with House Republicans ahead of speakership election Hugo Lowell Donald Trump is considering meeting with House Republicans at the Capitol next week, a source familiar with the former president\u2019s plans tells the Guardian, as his party works to elect a new speaker following Kevin McCarthy \u2019s overthrow. Trump is the frontrunner for the GOP\u2019s presidential nomination, and has been endorsed by several House lawmakers. He has denied involvement in congressman Matt Gaetz \u2019s successful effort to remove McCarthy from power, and both lawmakers call themselves Trump allies. 1h ago 17.15 BST More hints of the dynamics of the speaker\u2019s race within the House Republican Conference are emerging. The latest report is from the Messenger , which, citing unnamed sources, reports that Steve Scalise began campaigning to replace Kevin McCarthy even before he had been officially ousted. Scalise, the majority leader, is one of two major candidates who have declared their candidacy, along with judiciary chair Jim Jordan . Both are staunch conservatives, and the Messenger\u2019s report may explain why McCarthy\u2019s aides are reportedly encouraging lawmakers to support Jordan: Kevin McCarthy had just been ousted as speaker of the House. Republicans \u2014 and the entire Congress \u2014 were stunned. Yet McCarthy\u2019s deputy, House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., wasted no time, as he quietly launched a bid to become the next speaker, multiple sources tell The Messenger. Four Republican sources say Scalise started his campaign for speaker on Tuesday evening, moments after the House approved a far-right motion to vacate McCarthy from the speakership, before any other member had formally declared a candidacy. One House Republican who was lobbied by Scalise early Wednesday morning said the Louisiana Republican\u2019s outreach was \u201cwas too early.\u201d \u201cThe body wasn\u2019t even cold,\u201d the lawmaker, who was granted anonymity to speak candidly about the speaker\u2019s race, told The Messenger. \u201cIt was bullsh--.\u201d The race to replace McCarthy has just two declared candidates so far: Scalise, and Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, the chairman of the powerful House Judiciary Committee. There is also Rep. Kevin Hern, R-Okla., who has fielded support from members but has not yet formally announced a bid. 1h ago 16.53 BST Another thing that could prove pivotal to determining control of the House next year: the revolt that ousted Kevin McCarthy from office. His ouster was unprecedented, and the GOP is still digesting its implications for their broader campaign to hold onto the House, and regain the senate and White House next year. One lawmaker, Ohio\u2019s Max Miller , told CNN it set the party back: Rep. Max Miller fears GOP chaos could cost them House \u2014 and said he told that to Trump this week. \u201cHe\u2019s incredibly upset.\u201d Accuses Matt Gaetz of using the \u201cMAGA cloak\u201d to make it seem like Trump backs him. \u201cThat's why he's so good at what he does is because he's a BS artist\u201d pic.twitter.com/Bss7KEPpvg \u2014 Manu Raju (@mkraju) October 5, 2023 2h ago 16.36 BST Speaking of the House, the Cook Political Report just got its hand on Alabama\u2019s new congressional map and, as expected, Democrats appear set to win a new seat in the state: NEW: a federal court just selected Alabama's new congressional map, featuring an additional Black majority district. Under the remedial plan, #AL02 swings from Trump +29 to Biden +12, virtually assuring a Dem pickup. pic.twitter.com/9sXRVGwELB \u2014 Dave Wasserman (@Redistrict) October 5, 2023 The redrawn map came after the supreme court struck down an earlier version that included only one majority Black district, in what the justices determined was a violation of the Voting Rights Act. The state\u2019s Republican lawmakers tried to get around that by enacting a new map that didn\u2019t follow the court\u2019s decision, leading them to again order Alabama to draw new maps . With Republicans controlling the House by only four seats, the decision could prove pivotal to Democrats\u2019 quest to retake the majority in next year\u2019s elections. 2h ago 16.15 BST Former George Santos campaign treasurer pleads guilty to felony An ex-campaign treasurer for George Santos , the Republican congressman who admitted to lying about large portions of his resume and is currently facing federal fraud charges, will plead guilty to an unspecific felony, prosecutors have announced, according to the Associated Press. It is currently unknown to what charge Nancy Marks is admitting guilt, the AP reports. A veteran of Long Island politics, Marks worked with Santos on his two congressional runs. In May, federal prosecutors indicted Santos on 13 charges, including fraud and money laundering. Democrats have called on him to resign, and Santos is currently being investigated by the House ethics committee. 2h ago 15.57 BST Jim Jordan appeared on Fox News earlier today to make his pitch for why he would be a good speaker. Here\u2019s what he had to say: Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) on his candidacy for Speaker of the House in a Fox exclusive: \u201cYou need someone who can unite the conference \u2026 We have to have someone that can bring our team together. I think I\u2019m best equipped to do that.\u201d pic.twitter.com/ZVofF8glaI \u2014 The Recount (@therecount) October 5, 2023 3h ago 15.41 BST Back at the Capitol, Semafor reports that staffers for Kevin McCarthy have been making calls to support Jim Jordan\u2019s bid to replace him as speaker. Jordan is the chair of the judiciary committee a former leader of the far-right House Freedom Caucus, and among the most prominent of the lawmakers who boosted their profile by strenuously defending Donald Trump . The Ohio lawmaker is considered the strongest competitor to Steve Scalise , the House majority leader who is also vying to take over for McCarthy. Following his ouster from the speaker\u2019s chair on Tuesday, McCarthy did not endorse a successor, and Semafor reports it\u2019s unclear if his staffers are making calls to support Jordan at his orders. 3h ago 15.23 BST Trump asks for classified documents trial to be delayed till after 2024 election The Guardian\u2019s Hugo Lowell reports that Donald Trump has requested his trial on charges related to hiding classified government documents at Mar-a-Lago be delayed until after next year\u2019s presidential election: NEW: Trump asks for the Mar-a-Lago classified docs trial to be delayed until at least Nov 2024 \u2014 after the election \u2014 citing discovery complaints and the trial schedule for his lawyer Chris Kise. https://t.co/40Eiq6f527 \u2014 Hugo Lowell (@hugolowell) October 5, 2023 The former president is facing more than three dozen federal charges relating to taking classified materials with him when he departed the White House, then frustrating investigators\u2019 efforts to retrieve them from his south Florida resort. 3h ago 15.03 BST Republicans\u2019 demands have expanded from merely building a border wall. Some lawmakers and candidates, including Donald Trump, have recently publicly mulled invading Mexico, ostensibly to fight drug traffickers. As the Guardian\u2019s Ramon Antonio Vargas reports, on progressive Democrats wants them to knock it off: A progressive US congressman from Texas has asked his legislative colleagues to join him in condemning some American conservatives\u2019 calls to invade Mexico \u2013 ostensibly to do battle with drug cartels there. Joaquin Castro says he intends to file a resolution in the US House as soon as Friday reaffirming the federal government\u2019s \u201ccommitment to respecting the sovereignty of Mexico and condemning calls for military action without Mexico\u2019s consent and congressional authorization\u201d. The San Antonio Democrat and House foreign affairs committee member\u2019s proposed measure \u2013 a copy of which was provided to the Guardian \u2013 comes after a high-profile episode in May saw US senator John Kennedy urge the US to send its military into Mexico to confront drug cartels. In the process, Kennedy insulted Mexicans by saying they \u201cwould be eating cat food out of a can and living in a tent behind an Outback\u201d steakhouse restaurant if it were not for their proximity to the US. The racist remarks earned the Louisiana Republican criticism from Mexico\u2019s top government leaders as well as many of his compatriots. Former president Donald Trump, Florida governor Ron DeSantis and Vivek Ramaswamy \u2013 who are all seeking the Republican party\u2019s 2024 White House nomination \u2013 have similarly pledged to send US military forces into Mexico to wipe out drug lords if given the chance, as the Dallas Morning News reported . The resolution from Castro, who\u2019s served in the House since 2013, seeks to assert that the US and Mexico \u201chave cooperated for several decades on a variety of issues such as trade, investment, counter-narcotics, migration, rule of law and security, including through recent high-level security and economic dialogues\u201d. US representative files resolution decrying rightwing calls for invasion of Mexico Read more 4h ago 14.44 BST Biden waives federal laws to approve border wall construction The Biden administration has issued waivers to federal law in order to build border fencing in south Texas, the Associated Press reports. Building a wall along the US frontier with Mexico was a priority of Donald Trump \u2019s administration and remains so for many Republicans, but Joe Biden has opposed continuing the plan. His administration is however under pressure amid a surge in asylum seekers arriving at the southern border. Here\u2019s more on the wall construction, from the AP: The Joe Biden White House announced it waived 26 federal laws in south Texas to allow border wall construction on Wednesday, marking the administration\u2019s first use of a sweeping executive power employed often during Donald Trump\u2019s presidency. Homeland security department officials posted the announcement on the US federal registry with few details outlining the construction in Starr county, Texas, which is part of a busy border patrol sector seeing \u201chigh illegal entry\u201d. According to government data, about 245,000 illegal entries have been recorded so far this fiscal year in the Rio Grande Valley sector, which contains 21 counties. \u201cThere is presently an acute and immediate need to construct physical barriers and roads in the vicinity of the border of the United States in order to prevent unlawful entries into the United States in the project areas,\u201d the homeland security secretary, Alejandro Mayorkas, stated in the notice. The Clean Air Act, Safe Drinking Water Act and Endangered Species Act were some of the federal laws waived by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to make way for construction that will use funds from a congressional appropriation in 2019 for border wall construction. The waivers avoid time-consuming reviews and lawsuits challenging violation of environmental laws. Starr county\u2019s hilly ranchlands, sitting between Zapata and McAllen, Texas , is home to about 65,000 residents sparsely populating roughly 1,200 sq miles (3,108 sq km) that form part of the Lower Rio Grande Valley National Wildlife Refuge. Although no maps were provided in the announcement, federal customs and border protection officials announced the project in June and began gathering public comments in August when they shared a map of the additional construction that can add up to 20 miles (32km) to the existing border barrier system in the area. The Starr county judge Eloy Vera said it will start south of the Falcon Dam and go past Saline\u00f1o, Texas. \u201cThe other concern that we have is that area is highly erosive. There\u2019s a lot of arroyos,\u201d the county judge said, pointing out the creeks cutting through the ranchland and leading into the river. Biden waives 26 federal laws in south Texas to allow border wall construction Read more 4h ago 14.25 BST From the Guardian\u2019s Martin Pengelly and Joan E Greve , here\u2019s a look at two of the frontrunners who have emerged to replace Kevin McCarthy \u2013 both conservatives, but know for taking different approaches to governing: Jim Jordan of Ohio and Steve Scalise of Louisiana announced Wednesday they would seek to succeed Kevin McCarthy as speaker of the US House of Representatives, after the Californian was brutally removed by his own Republican party on Tuesday. Jordan is chair of the powerful judiciary committee, while Scalise is the majority leader. Both had been named as potential successors to McCarthy, and they confirmed their intentions to run for the top House job a day after the speakership was declared vacant. Pitching his candidacy in a \u201cDear Colleague\u201d letter, Jordan pledged to unify his fractious conference, which has repeatedly stumbled under the weight of a razor-thin majority. \u201cWe are at a critical crossroad in our nation\u2019s history. Now is the time for our Republican conference to come together to keep our promises to Americans,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cNo matter what we do, we must do it together as a conference. I respectfully ask for your support for speaker of the House of Representatives .\u201d But Scalise argued he had the experience needed to unite the conference, after serving as part of the House Republican leadership team for the past decade. \u201cI have a proven track record of bringing together the diverse array of viewpoints within our Conference to build consensus where others thought it impossible,\u201d Scalise said in his own \u201cDear Colleague\u201d letter. \u201cWe have an extremely talented Conference, and we all need to come together and pull in the same direction to get the country back on the right track.\u201d Republicans Jim Jordan and Steve Scalise launch House speakership bids Read more 4h ago 14.10 BST Few expect House to have new speaker by Wednesday - reports In theory, the House will be back to normal by next Wednesday, when lawmakers will vote on a new speaker. In practice, few in the chamber believe the infighting that led to Kevin McCarthy \u2019s overthrow will be resolved by then. Reports concluding this have been trickling out over the past day, and, this morning Axios revealed some of the dynamics behind this dysfunction. \u201cThere are way too many potential blowup points for this leadership vacuum to be easily resolved, thanks to a rump caucus of Republicans who proved they\u2019ll break with the overwhelming majority of their colleagues,\u201d they write. Conservatives are unlikely to vote for any candidate that would give more aid to Ukraine, while moderates want whoever is the new speaker to make it more difficult to remove the chamber\u2019s head. And then there\u2019s the fact that, with 435 members, there are plenty of people in the House who just don\u2019t like each other. We\u2019ll get a sense of these dynamics over the days to come, and especially on Tuesday, when a candidate\u2019s forum for those seeking the speaker\u2019s post will be held. 5h ago 13.47 BST McCarthy's ouster imperils Ukraine aid, threatens government shutdown Good morning, US politics blog readers. Not 48 hours after the House of Representatives was paralyzed by a far-right revolt that ousted Kevin McCarthy from the speaker\u2019s chair, the broader implications are becoming clear. Leaderless, the chamber is in disarray, but lawmakers nonetheless have crucial work to do. One of McCarthy\u2019s last acts was passing a deal to prevent a government shutdown that would have begun this last Sunday, but the bill funds the government only till 17 November. That is more than a month away, but Congress is riven with divisions over government spending, and the House\u2019s present dysfunction robs lawmakers of time to address them. Then there\u2019s the prospects for continued American aid to Ukraine. That, too, must be approved by Congress, and while senators of both parties appear open to continuing to help Kyiv, House conservatives are opposed, with speaker candidate Jim Jordan saying he will not bring further aide to the floor, if elected. Joe Biden , meanwhile, said yesterday he is exploring other ways to assist Ukraine, and will make a major speech on it soon. We\u2019ll be following these stories today. Here\u2019s what else is going on: Biden will at 12pm eastern time receive a briefing on Ukraine from his national security team, which could perhaps lead him to reveal more details about his plan to continue aid. Should Republicans continue holding debates, even though presidential frontrunner Donald Trump is not attending? Some party officials think the answer should be no, Politico reports . Kamala Harris and a host of other politicians will be in San Francisco for senator Dianne Feinstein \u2019s funeral. Harris delivers remarks at 4pm eastern time.

    "description": "This week's value can be found outside of the biggest games on the slate",
    "content": "Week 6 of the season should be an exciting one, with four games pitting ranked opponents against one another. Outside of that, teams like No. 13 and No. 11 are expected to get tough tests against unranked opponents. But a lot of this week's betting value can be found outside of this weekend's top-billed games. A lot of the ranked matchups are either too close to call or filled with too much uncertainty to confidently find a value play. Not that some of the more notable games lack merit. The aforementioned Washington State Cougars are actually underdogs on the road against unranked , which is looking to pick up its first Pac-12 win and stay afloat in the conference race. No. 23 is looking to bounce back on the road against No. 21 in a game that could see plenty of offense. This column needs a bounce back, as well. After a 4-1 start to things, we've had just two hits in the last two weeks. Last week was filled with bad beats: starting quarterback was ruled out right before kickoff against , throwing the Jayhawks covering a 16.5-point spread out the window, while and came within three points short of hitting the over. 1-4 6-9 Here are the value plays that bettors should keep an eye on during Week 6 of the college football season. Friday, 7:30 p.m. | Boone Pickens Stadium -- Stillwater, Oklahoma Oklahoma State has managed to stumble its way through the 19th easiest schedule in the nation and still has two losses on its resume. The Cowboys started the year 2-0, though their season-opening 27-13 win against FCS did little to instill confidence, and have not won a game since. That includes a 33-7 loss to , which may have been a new low in Mike Gundy's tenure. Kansas State's only setback thus far was on the road against a now-ranked Missouri team. Both squads are coming off a bye here, but if Oklahoma State can lose by 26 against the likes of South Alabama, Kansas State should have no problem maintaining a pretty comfortable gap in this one. Saturday, 12 p.m. | Faurot Field at Memorial Stadium -- Columbia, Missouri LSU is the type of team that boasts an offense that few can stop and a defense that might be better off just staying on the bench. The Tigers (from LSU) are fresh off a 55-49 loss to -- the highest-scoring FBS game this season. LSU quarterback passed for 414 yards and four touchdowns. Four LSU receivers had at least 50 yards through the air. Now Daniels and company get to go against a Missouri team that ranks ninth in the SEC in pass defense, allowing over 242 yards through the air per game. Missouri is no slouch offensively. Quarterback , who is getting healthier each week since he hyperextended his knee against Kansas State, and wide receiver Luther Burden are a potent duo. The two have combined for 629 yards and four touchdowns, more than any other quarterback-wide receiver combo in the nation. All this to say, points should come easy in Saturday's game. Saturday, 3 p.m. | Rose Bowl Stadium -- Pasadena, California It's not everyday that the No. 13 team in the nation is considered an underdog, even if that team is playing on the road. But the Cougars enter Saturday's contest +3.5 against UCLA. Instead of hitting a spread with meager payouts -- especially one so thin -- the money line brings a ton of value here. In fact, it almost feels like stealing. UCLA hasn't seen a team like Washington State yet. The Bruins lead the Pac-12 in scoring defense, allowing just 11 points per game and are second in total defense, but they have yet to play an FBS team that ranks better than 61st in offensive efficiency. The Cougars rank 11th nationally in offensive efficiency, sixth nationally in total offense (533.8 yards per game) and fifth nationally in scoring offense (45.8 points per game). UCLA should be able to move the ball if this game evolves into a shootout, as Wazzu's defense is quite porous. But in that scenario, it's smarter to lean on a veteran quarterback like WSU's over UCLA freshman , who hasn't had to play in a game like that at the collegiate level. Saturday, 3:30 p.m. | Memorial Stadium -- Clemson, South Carolina Only one of Clemson's three games against power conference competition this season has reached 50 total points, and it took overtime to get there. On the other hand, Wake Forest and its opponents have combined for at least 50 points in all but one of the Demon Deacons' four games this year. That being said, Wake Forest has yet to play an FBS team with a winning record, and it has yet to try and move the ball against anything close to Clemson's defense. The Tigers are strong as ever on that side of the ball, pacing the ACC in total defense (266.4 yards per game) while allowing 20.8 points per contest. Wake Forest isn't going to score much, which puts the burden on Clemson. Dabo Swinney's squad has only managed at least 40 points on its own against FCS and a 1-3 team. Saturday, 6:30 p.m. ET | Mountain America Stadium -- Tempe, Arizona Before the season started this game might have been at worst a tossup, but it's pretty clear at this point that Colorado is the better team. The Buffaloes have already exceeded expectations, with a 3-2 record against the hardest schedule in college football. They've already beaten better teams than Arizona State, and came within seven points of shocking a squad that some see as a College Football Playoff contender. The Sun Devils, meanwhile, are 1-4. Their lone win was a three-point triumph against FCS in the season opener. To make matters worse, ASU is down to its third-string quarterback for Saturday's game, as starter and his backup are both out with injuries. Colorado's defense has been a concern this season, but it should be able to get enough stops against a shorthanded Arizona State.",

    "description": "The new WNBA Golden State franchise will begin play in 2025",
    "content": "Joe Lacob is no stranger to making bold promises and building winning teams. Now, the man who helped turn the into a dynasty -- with four titles and six Finals appearances since he bought the franchise in 2010 -- is hoping to do the same in the WNBA. On Thursday, the WNBA officially granted Lacob and the Warriors that will begin play in 2025. The yet unnamed team will play at Chase Center and practice at the Warriors' facility in Oakland. If all goes to plan, they'll be hoisting a trophy sooner rather than later. \"First press conference with the Warriors, I said we will win a championship in the first five years,\" Lacob said during a press conference to officially announce the team on Thursday. \"I'm telling you right now, we will win a WNBA championship in the first five years of this franchise.\" Put this in your bookmarks. owner Joseph Lacob vows that once play begins, they will win a championship in the first 5 years of their existence \ud83d\ude4c Lacob's claim may be audacious, but that's the kind of mindset any owner should have. It's also not out of the realm of possibility. The Seattle Storm won a title in their first five years of existence, and the Atlanta Dream got to two Finals in their initial five seasons. For a full historical account, here's a look at the timeline for the most recent expansion franchises. Note: This only includes teams that are still in operation and joined the league since 2000. As you can see, there is a wide range of outcomes for expansion franchises. The one common denominator is you're almost certainly going to be bad in your first season. From there a lot depends on draft luck, developing players, coaching and resources. On the latter, it's clear Lacob and Co. will spare no expense. The team isn't even playing yet and has its own dedicated practice facility, which some current teams can't claim. That kind of commitment doesn't guarantee success, but it goes a long way. \"We're coming in here, number one, to win,\" . \"Number two, we want to see this league and women's basketball grow, and we hope to be a big part of it. We think it's a watershed event for us to come in and commit to it in a big way. We're going to bring all of our resources. We can put this machine to work, and we're going to do that.\"",

    "description": "According to figures published by the journal Nature, 73% of the world's antibiotics are used in the production of domestic animals. They are used primarily for preventive purposes because these animals are kept in confined and unhygienic conditions, but are also administered to promote growth.",
    "content": "October 5, 2023 This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies . Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility: fact-checked peer-reviewed publication trusted source proofread by Christina Benjaminsen, SINTEF According to figures published by the journal Nature , 73% of the world's antibiotics are used in the production of domestic animals. They are used primarily for preventive purposes because these animals are kept in confined and unhygienic conditions, but are also administered to promote growth. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1449240174198-2'); }); The result is that bacteria are becoming increasingly resistant to essential and life-saving antibiotics. So says Gunhild Hageskal, who is a Senior Research Scientist at the Norwegian science institute SINTEF. Together with her colleagues, including Anne T\u00f8ndervik, she is currently working in the field of antibiotic resistance, which is currently regarded as one of the biggest threats to global public health. \"We know that resistant microbes can be transmitted from animals to humans via our food and the environment,\" says Hageskal. \"This interaction is recognized as part of a 'One Health perspective,' acknowledging that all things are interconnected and that the battle to combat resistance must be fought at all levels,\" she says. A reduction in the use of antibiotics alone is no longer sufficient to combat the global increase in resistant microbes. According to The Lancet , preventive approaches must be introduced in order to inhibit transmission, with a particular focus on the livestock sector. And the problem is getting worse. Global prognoses for 2050 indicate that 10 million people will die each year because bacteria are developing antibiotic resistance. In comparison, only 7 million died in the course of three years as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Together with Iceland, Norway can boast at being clearly among the best in the world when it comes to limiting its use of antibiotics in the livestock sector. It is prohibited in the Norwegian sector to use antibiotics to promote growth or prevent disease. However, you don't have to look any further than Denmark to find that it is common practice for pigs and other animals to be administered with antibiotics in their feed. According to the researchers, the situation is worse by far in Asia and South America. As consumers, we should bear this in mind when we buy Argentinian beef, Danish bacon or Spanish ham. Meat is of course incorporated into a variety of processed products, and even if the label says that the country of origin is Norway, this doesn't necessarily mean that the animal was reared in Norway. However, even if Norway's problems are small compared to the rest of the world, we shouldn't be complacent. The world is more globalized than ever, and resistant microbes (bacteria and fungi, Ed.) have no respect for national boundaries. We are currently already seeing an increase in infections that are difficult to treat in Norwegian hospitals. According to SINTEF researchers, 1.3 million people died in 2019 because their treatment failed as the result of antibiotic resistance. An additional 5 million died due to associated problems. We continue to find unwanted microbes in the Norwegian food production sector. This is why disinfection procedures are a very important part of the production process. The use of disinfection is crucial to disease prevention and the control of microbial threats in many fields, such as medicine, agriculture, aquaculture, food production, the drinking water and cleaning sectors, as well as personal hygiene. \"The problem is simply that the use of disinfectants can itself cause bacteria to develop resistance to antibiotics,\" says Anne T\u00f8ndervik, who is also a Senior Research Scientist at SINTEF. This issue is described as a gap in our knowledge as we engage in the battle against antibiotic resistance. When a bacterium is exposed to antibiotics it adopts a number of strategies to protect itself. In basic terms, these strategies are identical to those that it uses to protect itself against other chemicals such as disinfectants. Some bacteria are even resilient enough to ward off the very agents that are designed to destroy them. These can then reproduce, enabling their descendants to inherit their resistance. Resistance may also develop naturally as a result of genetic mutation. \"We have seen indications that disinfectants can promote resistance and possibly also so-called cross-resistance, which enables bacteria to resist the threats of both antibiotics and disinfectants,\" says Hageskal. \"It is well known that disinfectants that contain quaternary ammonium compounds (one of the three most common active substances used for disinfection) are able to promote antibiotic resistance,\" she says. It is this problem that SINTEF is currently addressing as part of the project called DisinfectAMR. Together with its research partners at NTNU, SINTEF is looking into the effectiveness of agents used to disinfect poultry and salmon production lines, and whether these may have unwanted side effects in terms of contributing to antibiotic resistance. In order to compare condition status in Norway with the situation overseas, researchers are working together with the University of Lasi in Romania, where scientists are taking samples from the premises of a local poultry producer. A Ph.D. student is also participating in the project. To date, researchers have been focusing on what are known as slaughterhouse processing lines. These conceal many nooks and crannies that are difficult to keep clean, even when premises are washed down and disinfected on a daily basis. \"This is where biofilms are created. Biofilms form thin, slimy layers of microbes that in some cases can be difficult to spot with the naked eye,\" says T\u00f8ndervik. \"Biofilms are another piece in the puzzle. They represent the natural habitat of bacteria and are well-known for acting as the cradle of resistance development,\" she says. The reason for this is that bacteria enjoy better protection in biofilms and can survive the disinfection process. It is easier for them to exchange so-called genetic elements when many are assembled in the same place. Biofilms are also known to be involved in 80% of all infections in humans. In order to evaluate the problem and investigate the links between antibiotic resistance and the various kinds of disinfectants, the researchers have collected bacteria from a number of surfaces in poultry and salmon processing lines. To date, they have established a \"clan assemblage\" of approximately 1,000 bacterial isolates, which are now being studied in detail in laboratories at SINTEF and NTNU. These bacteria are being identified and tested with a number of different disinfectants currently in use in the same processing lines. \"We're also studying the variety of bacteria in the biofilms in the processing lines\u2014the so-called microbiome\u2014both before and after disinfection in order to see how the disinfection process impacts on bacterial communities across the slaughterhouse,\" explains Hageskal. In the next stage of the project, the genomes in the microbiome will be mapped and analyzed. This will give the researchers a clearer picture of which resistance genes are present. Even if the researchers succeed in destroying a bacterium, the genes that carry the resistance may still be intact and can be transmitted in residual raw materials and wastewater. This is how the snowball keeps on rolling. \"For this reason, it's important to acquire as much knowledge as possible about how we can remove unwanted bacteria from the production process most effectively,\" says Hageskal.

    "content": "Attorneys representing former Michigan State coach Mel Tucker sent a 106-page letter to the university's interim president and board of trustees on Thursday outlining \"new evidence\" in his sexual misconduct case. This as the university begins its hearing, also Thursday, into allegations against Tucker made by rape survivor and activist Brenda Tracy. The letter, by attorney Jennifer Z. Belveal, aims to identify contradictions in Tracy's allegations, which led to Michigan State's investigation and Tucker's subsequent firing. It alleges that Tracy \"manipulated a key witness\" and \"deleted key evidence.\" It also claims Tracy's motivations for filing the complaint were financial and contains partially redacted messages between Tracy and her former assistant, now deceased. \"Money is my only recourse to make him feel like there is a punishment,\" Tracy wrote in one message, according to the letter, \"when they do the money I should make him pay me 10k directly.\" Tucker, who was not present at Thursday's hearing due to a \"serious medical condition,\" was initially suspended without pay on Sept. 10 after Tracy's allegations were made public. Michigan State initiated the firing process eight days later, citing Tucker's moral turpitude clause of his contract. Tucker and his attorneys are in which the coach claims university leadership had ulterior motives; by firing him with cause, Michigan State avoids paying Tucker the nearly $80 million left on his deal. Tucker amassed a 20-14 record during his time with the Spartans. He was hired in 2020 and the following year led Michigan State to its first 11-win season since 2015. Michigan State went 5-7 in 2022 and was off to a 2-0 start at the time of Tucker's suspension. Former defensive backs coach Harlon Barnett is serving as the interim coach for the remainder of the season.",

He was 80 years old. We're told someone went to check on Butkus at his home on Thursday ... and he was found unresponsive. The family later released the following : Dick Butkus, a legendary Bears Hall of Fame middle linebacker and Chicago native who many still consider the most ferocious defensive player in NFL history, has passed away. He was 80. The Butkus Family released the following statement: \"The Butkus Family confirms that football and entertainment legend Dick Butkus died peacefully in his sleep overnight at home in Malibu, Calif. The Butkus family is gathering with Dick's wife Helen. They appreciate your prayers and support.\" \"Dick was the ultimate Bear, and one of the greatest players in NFL history,\" Bears chairman George H. McCaskey said in a statement. \"He was Chicago's son. He exuded what our great city is about and, not coincidently, what George Halas looked for in a player: toughness, smarts, instincts, passion and leadership. He refused to accept anything less than the best from himself, or from his teammates. When we dedicated the George Halas statue at our team headquarters, we asked Dick to speak at the ceremony, because we knew he spoke for Papa Bear. \"Dick had a gruff manner, and maybe that kept some people from approaching him, but he actually had a soft touch. His legacy of philanthropy included a mission of ridding performance enhancing drugs from sports and promoting heart health. His contributions to the game he loved will live forever and we are grateful he was able to be at our home opener this year to be celebrated one last time by his many fans. \"We extend our condolences to Helen, Dick's high school sweetheart and wife of 60 years, and their family.\" They also posted this on Twitter: Dick Butkus was a legend who embodied what it means to be a Chicago Bear. Our hearts go out to his family and friends. As did the NFL: The NFL is mourning the loss of legendary Hall of Famer Dick Butkus. Our thoughts are with his family and the Bears organization. Fans on Twitter/X shared their reaction to Butkus's passing: Very sad. He is on the Mount Rushmore of Bears players. One of the best defensive players ever in football He once held the record for 26 fumble recoveries and is tied for 11th in Bears history at 22 career interceptions. The Bears retired his jersey in 1994. Damn, he was just on here tweeting like a week ago...RIP to a legend. He was. If the Bears don\u2019t win tonight\u2026 \ud83d\ude24 The Bears play Washington tonight for Thursday night football. Kickoff is at 7:15 pm Chicago time. Dick Butkus had one of the greatest commercials ever. He had a lot of very fun commercials. Throwback to this epic Dick Butkus exchange RIP to a great one This was epic. Super Sky Point to the predatory, legendary, and utterly hilarious Dick Butkus. He was, and always will be, the goddamn physical embodiment of the greatness of the city of Chicago. If your kids don\u2019t know, just tell \u2018em if he didn\u2019t know who had the ball he\u2019d tackle the entire\u2026 He was incredible on the field. To really understand the greatness of Dick Butkus, he was the NFL Defensive Player of the Year in 1969 despite the fact that the Bears finished 1-13. RIP to a legend. What an achievement. Dick Butkus presenting that ball to the defender after the TD in 1971 was priceless. RIP Priceless. Prediction: Bears lose by 51 points to honor Dick Butkus. RIP legend. This writer is a Packer fan, so it wouldn't be a post about the Bears without some good natured fun. Somebody give me some pads and a QB to tackle. Our sympathies and prayers are with the Butkus family and the NFL as they mourn the loss of one of the greats. ***",

    "content": "Hall of Fame linebacker Dick Butkus, whose name became synonymous with the Chicago Bears and hard-nosed defense, has died, his family announced Thursday. Butkus was 80. \"The Butkus family confirms that football and entertainment legend Dick Butkus died peacefully in his sleep overnight at home in Malibu, California,\" the family said in a statement. \"The Butkus family is gathering with Dick's wife Helen. They appreciate your prayers and support.\" Additional information was not yet provided. The news came less than two hours before the Bears were slated to face the host Washington Commanders in a \"Thursday Night Football\" matchup. Born in Chicago, Butkus built his memorable football career in his home state, becoming an All-American at Illinois before joining the Bears in 1965. Butkus became a two-time NFL Defensive Player of the Year (1969, 1970) and an eight-time Pro Bowl selection in a nine-year pro career before going on to work as a broadcaster, pitchman and actor. He played 119 games for the Bears, tallying 22 interceptions, 27 fumble recoveries and at least 11 sacks during an era when defensive statistics weren't closely kept. He is a member of both the College Football and Pro Football Halls of Fame. \"Some people were made to be doctors, others to be lawyers,\" Butkus once said. \"I was made to play football.\" --Field Level Media",

It probably had something to do with him declaring that American conservatives needed to be put in reeducation camps and made to do forced labor. \"American conservatism is a mental illness that needs to be eradicated through reeducation camps and forced labor\" Yes Apparently, he, like many others, was upset about conservatives being less than broken up about the murder of a far-left activist on a New York City street. Reportedly, his girlfriend, who watched him get stabbed to death in the chest, refused to give a description of the (black male) suspect caught on video doing it. She literally refused to tell the police the description of her boyfriend\u2019s killer because it would cause \u201cracist stereotypes\u201d. If anyone needs reeducation camps, it\u2019s progressives like her, nevermind the killers. You want people in \"Reeducation camps and forced labor\" and I'm the delusional? Who's going to put me in a camp if you already defunded the police? Reeducation camps and forced labor? Jestin wants to be him so bad, it\u2019s plain to see.

There's a shot of the activist's girlfriend showing off her MARX license plate. The chances of you and your friends making that happen is literally zero. And are you going to be putting these people through reeducation camps and forced labor, or are you just gonna expect LEOs and the military to do it? Congratulations on absolutely vindicating the very people you\u2019re trying to condemn lol What happened to Ryan Carson was horrific and absolutely meaningless. Sorry there are some who aren't as broken up about it. Bloomberg/WaPo op-ed writer is so mad about posts on Ryan Carson\u2019s stabbing that he deleted X from his phone. ..But he\u2019s still on here posting his article. And he\u2019s still going to \u201ccontinue to follow X.\u201d He\u2019s just really mad at There are 2 subreddits, one with 500K subscribers, anther with 1 million, dedicated to celebrating misfortune and deaths of political opponents, mostly conservatives.

    "content": "The football community lost an icon Thursday when Dick Butkus . Butkus was best known for his Hall of Fame career as a linebacker for the Chicago Bears from 1965-73, but his legacy is not limited to professional football. Butkus' legendary career at earned him a place in the Hall of Fame. His name is so synonymous with excellence that the award presented to college football's best linebacker every year bears his name. \"I am saddened to learn of the passing of Dick Butkus, the greatest linebacker in football history,\" Illinois coach Bret Bielema said in a press release. \"As the head coach of his alma mater that he loved, I had the great honor to meet Dick, one of my childhood idols, last September. He was an amazing person, as well as football player, and a loyal Illini. Dick embodied everything that Illinois football has represented in the past and what we look to represent into the future. His deep love for Illinois football will be honored and remembered forever.\" A Chicago native, Butkus attended Illinois in the early-to-mid 1960s, playing center and middle linebacker for the Fighting Illini from 1962-64. His impact for the Illinois program was immediate. Butkus was an All-Big Ten selection his first year. While the team finished 2-7 that fall, far more success for both Butkus and the program as whole was on the horizon. \"Dick Butkus was a giant in a land of giants,\" Illinois athletic director Josh Whitman said in a release. \"In a game built on toughness and tenacity, he stood alone. One of the most imposing figures to ever wear a helmet, away from the field, Dick was self-effacing, humble, and generous. A cultural icon, Dick leaves a legacy on Americana that will never be forgotten.\" The 1963 season saw Illinois compile an 8-1-1 overall record, capturing the Big Ten championship and ending the season with a Rose Bowl victory against for a No. 3 finish in the AP rankings. Butkus was the star of the show for the Illini defense that season, winning Big Ten Player of the Year honors and Unanimous All-American honors. In 1964 Butkus finished third in Heisman voting and was named a Consensus All American as Illinois finished 6-3 and ranked No. 16. \"Our University is better, our game is better, and our country is better, all because we were graced by the presence of one Dick Butkus,\" Whitman said. For his Illinois career, Butkus totaled 347 tackles. His 145 tackles in 1963 stood as a school record until 1976. Butkus also toppled the century-mark in 1964, registering 132 total tackles before he went No. 3 overall in the 1965 to the Chicago Bears. Butkus' No. 50 was retired by the university in 1986 before he was named to the Walter Camp Foundation All-Century team in 1989. Additionally, Butkus is a member of the Illinois Athletics Hall of Fame. By going on to play exclusively for Chicago in the NFL, Butkus was able to spend his entire football playing career within his native Illinois. In his eight-year NFL tenure, Butkus totaled 1,020 tackles, 22 interceptions, and 25 fumble recoveries. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1979.",

This season, however, the Mets were grave disappointments as they went 75-87 and finished in fourth place in the National League East despite the highest payroll in history. Eppler's resignation comes not long after former executive and new lead decision-maker. \"Billy Eppler led this team through a 101-win season and postseason berth last year and he will be missed,\" Mets owner Steve Cohen said in the statement released by the team. \"We accepted Billy's resignation today as he decided it is in everyone's best interest to fully hand over the leadership of Baseball Operations to David Stearns. On behalf of the Mets organization, we wish him all the best.\" \"I wanted David [Stearns] to have a clean slate and that meant me stepping down,\" Eppler said in that same statement. \"I hope for nothing but the best for the entire Mets organization.\" Given Eppler's presence at Stearns' introductory press conference, the decision comes a surprise. That may be explained by the reported investigation by the league noted above. While Stearns and the Mets will likely replace Eppler at some point, it's not an urgent matter given that Stearns is already in place atop baseball operations.

    "description": "\u201cWe\u2019re just on another level right now and it\u2019s really awesome.\u201d",
    "content": "HELENA \u2014 The Flying Bs of Bozeman High, bookended by two Neils, buried their competition Thursday afternoon at the Capital City 7 of 7 Invitational. In a very 2016-esque performance, the Hawks\u2019 boys team averaged a 21.51-second margin of victory in sweeping all seven races for the first time since 2016. \u201cThat was really fun,\u201d senior, and No.1 runner, Nathan Neil said. \u201cEvery single time one of our guys won a race, it just got me more hyped and ready to go\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s really fun to watch those guys achieve because they don\u2019t get all the hype I get, but they\u2019re right there working with me.\u201d Neil, last year\u2019s Class AA state runner-up, cracked the 15-second barrier for just the second time in his career, gapping Manhattan Christian\u2019s Oren Arthun with four-minute, 42.03-second and 5:04 second and third miles to post a 14:59.60. \u201cNot falling asleep in the middle of the race,\u201d Neil said of a sub-15-second key. \u201cWhen you\u2019re out by yourself, a lot of times it\u2019s easy to fall asleep and slow down a little bit. You just gotta keep pushing \u2013 that\u2019s really the key there.\u201d Neil, who posted the only other sub-15-second time in the state of Montana on Sept. 1, bested Arthun by 36.39 seconds, the largest margin of Bozeman\u2019s seven male runners on Thursday. \u201cWhen you see consistency in racing, it\u2019s because there\u2019s consistency in training,\u201d Hawks head coach Casey Jermyn said. \u201cIf you know Nathan, you know he is the most dedicated, the most consistent person\u2026 \u201cHe shows up every day and does his work out, does his long runs, does his recovery runs, and he\u2019s like a machine. When he\u2019s doing that in practice, you see those types of results in races.\u201d Taylor Neil, Nathan\u2019s freshman younger brother, set a personal record with his 16:46.12, while sophomores Miles Halvorsen (No. 5 race, 16:32.43) and Christian Landers (No. 3 race, 16:43.41) got close in victories. Kieran Anderson (16:53.52) and Daniel Johnson (16:36.68) won the No. 6 and No. 4 races for Bozeman, while first-year varsity runner Jeremy Posdon held off Helena High freshman Milo Kauffman in the No. 2 race. \u201cI was happy with that \u2013 I\u2019m really excited about my fitness,\u201d Posdon said. \u201cWe have a race we're going to in Seattle that I\u2019m really excited for, so today was to see how I felt and try to win\u2026 \u201cWe wanted to get the seven-people first place.\u201d Kauffman, whose second place represented the Bengals\u2019 best boys performance, out-paced Posdon with a 4:57.07 first mile. He fell into Posdon\u2019s wake with a four-second slower second mile, but turned in a really solid 5:33 third mile to establish a 10-second personal record (16:12.21) and finish just six and a half seconds behind his Bozeman counterpart. \u201cIt went really good,\u201d Kauffman said. \u201cI just went out, wanted to win, and tried to lead but I couldn\u2019t hold the guy. He just ran a better race.\u201d Running competitively since he was in seventh grade, Kauffman said he hopes to be All-State as a freshman. His previous best run of 16:22.9 ranked 23rd in Class AA entering Thursday. On the girls side, Hardin\u2019s Karis Brightwings-Pease repeated as girls No. 1 champion. The freshman and reigning Class A cross-country state champion PRed with a time of 18:15.77 to anchor a fourth-place finish for Hardin in the team standings. Bozeman\u2019s Natalie Nicholas (18:56.10) won the girls No. 6 race and Gallatin\u2019s Bella Determan (18:41.44) did the same in the No. 5 race. It was Determan who disrupted a streak of four consecutive Missoula Hellgate victories to begin the meet. Hellgate, the defending Class AA girls cross-country champions, won the girls team 7 of 7 title for the second time in four years, edging out Bozeman and Gallatin. Claire Rutherford (fourth, No. 1 race) and Isabel Ross (second, No. 2 race), Gallatin\u2019s standout sophomores from a year ago, anchored the reigning Class AA state third-place finishers on Thursday. \u201cIt was definitely painful \u2013 the hills are tough \u2013 but I think I did a good job of pushing through the pain and not slowing down when I felt like I needed to give up,\u201d Ross said of her race. \u201cI think everyone is on track to peak at state. The coaches\u2019 training plan has really put us in that position and I\u2019m really excited to see what we can do. I think we have a really good chance to do really well.\u201d Hellgate senior Rose Wiltse, who entered Thursday with the fastest girls 5,000-meter time in the state, finished fifth in the girls No. 1 race (19:00.04). Gia Petrini (19:00.12, No. 4 race), Myla Spoon (20:14.51, No. 5 race), Kaitlyn Skinner (20:15.76, No. 6 race) and Audrey Baldwin (20:40.80, No. 7 race) took home first place finishes for the Knights. So, back to that 2016 Bozeman boys team that swept the 7 of 7. It too was anchored by a sub-15-second performance (Chase Equall \u2013 14:55.14) and had some kid named Duncan Hamilton run the No. 3 race. Like those two, Nathan Neil has the talent to run collegiately and has committed to the University of Washington. According to Jermyn, the 2016 and 2023 teams are very equal in terms of depth. This team has aspirations of repeating as state champions, then chasing a regional and national championship, just like seven years prior. Bright and early Friday morning, the Hawks leave for the Nike Hole in the Wall XC Invitational right outside Seattle \u2013 a meet to see where Bozeman, and Neil, stack up nationally. \u201cYeah, definitely,\u201d Neil said of being favorites at the state meet. \u201cThis is a really, really fast year for Montana \u2013 Billings West is a great team, Great Falls High is a great team\u2026 \u201cWe\u2019re just on another level right now and it\u2019s really awesome.\u201d",

    "content": "So a spunky new technology e-zine has entered the foray - 404 Media. It appears 404 Media is a cutting edge publication personed with bright young minds who cover the tech scene with a left-leaning slant. So in other words, it's as fresh as Buzzfeed circa 2008. Oh, except one thing, it's paywalled for subscribers, which makes it as hip and cutting-edge as Substack, we guess. Anyway, this Tweet got a bit of buzz. Why? Well, there's a bit to unpack here. One, the time between a new technology and a tasteless meme is roughly 5.3 seconds in 2023 so we're not sure what the big deal is here. Two, the hipster journalist's efforts to 'problematize' everything is eye-rollingly played out. And three, there's the amusing running to Nintendo to ask if they knew what Bing was doing to their copyrighted characters. We also asked if it knew Bing is generating images of Kirby doing 9/11. It reminds us of the schoolyard gossip to runs to the mean girl and asks if she knows that the popular girl is talking smack about her to the jock who she ... well, you get the picture. i'm sorry, it's just funny how well this image captures the rush into generative AI tools with so little thought about consequences Naw, brah, it's just funny. Period. But at the same time, we also can't stop laughing and the self-important chin scratching concern over how 'little thought about consequences' relates to a Spongebob Squarepants meme done in bad taste. Did we mention that the author was so disturbed by this that she created the memes herself? I generated a bunch of AI images of beloved fictional characters doing 9/11, and I\u2019m not the only one. Let's get back to what you're here for - the ruthless and well-deserved mockery. holy shit I just typed this into a word processor and it straight up allowed me, murder is NOT actually good you guys omg we are NOT ready for the future Props to Mike for getting right to the heart of the matter in hilarious form. It\u2019s weird. There\u2019s definitely a problem. I typed \u201cdumb person writes an article\u201d into Bing and it linked me to this tweet. No, I think AI is actually working in this case. Oh, how clever you are, remembering memes and recycling them. Want a cookie? Others took the ball and ran with it. Bing is literally killing people Of course. If we can't lay this tragedy at the feet of an evil corporation, did it even happen? Other than that, Mario, how was the play? Spit take worthy! Thank you Pete. Did you think about the consequences? Wait 'til he sees this. It'll send him over the edge. Bonus points for the mashup with the Current Thing! Did you also blame Crayola for your application to journalism school? We do. Maybe Kirby is trying to save lives by kamikazing into the planes the terrorists are flying? Did you think of that? Our own Aaron Walker has thoughts. This kind of stuff is silly and will result in silly laws being passed and I want off this rock. Not wrong. You don't think mediocre journalists gunning to be the next Upton Sinclair don't cause stupid laws? Consider the plastic straw hysteria. we should have more sympathy for people who are technologically illiterate and have never built anything, just now grasping the idea that a computer will do whatever you tell it to do thanks to AI making compute accessible, even to journalists. it\u2019s probably very frightening. It's like momma said, 'those who can, do, those who can't, teach and those who fail, problematize.' Journalism is when you buy a knife, stab someone with it, then attack the knife manufacturer for not doing more to stop you And that's all we got to say about that. This is how you create a story on a slow news day. Wait, no! One more. And that's a wrap. ***",

    "description": "Paul has been excellent next to superstar guards during previous stops in his career",
    "content": "The new-look are looking to bounce back from a disappointing season with the offseason addition of , but there are certainly questions about his fit. The 38-year-old future Hall of Famer rose to excellence by having the ball in his hands and operating almost exclusively out of the pick-and-roll. Now he finds himself on a team with two other primary creators in and , in a Steve Kerr system that prioritizes ball and player movement over pick-and-roll -- often to the great despair of Dub Nation. One person not worried about the fit, however, is Curry. Coming off one of the best seasons of his storied career, Curry said on Thursday that he and Paul have played \"a lot\" of pickup this offseason, and the two are already thriving. \"It's mad fun,\" Curry said of playing next to Paul. \"I get the rebound and push, I can throw it ahead in transition knowing he's pretty sure with the ball. He makes the right decision. He's been really good catching and shooting when he's open, moving without the basketball. ... It's pretty seamless, really, to be honest.\" Paul is no stranger to playing with superstar guards, and history suggests that operating alongside Curry won't be a problem. In Paul's first year next to , and , the , and all had significant success when the duos shared the floor. James Harden (2017-18) 118.6 105.5 13.1 Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (2019-20) 117.1 109.7 7.4 Devin Booker (2020-21) 117.1 110.2 6.9 As you can see, the \"there's only one ball\" theory has never been an obstacle for Paul, who has become an elite spot-up shooter. He ranked in the 98th percentile in catch-and-shoot efficiency last season with the Suns, per Synergy Sports, and in the 94th percentile in spot-up situations. The guy knows how to get it done without the ball. The bigger issues, as Curry pointed out on Thursday, will come on the defensive end. With Paul standing at an even six-feet and Curry at 6-2, the duo could be challenged by some of the league's bigger, stronger guard pairings, and potentially hunted by opposing stars in a playoff setting. \"There's challenges in terms of how we match up, making sure we're defensively sound and how we play on that end of the floor and how we adapt with the other three guys that are out there with us, whoever that is,\" Curry said. \" ... You obviously have to rebound, and there's an attention to detail on mechanics and reads that can help us do our work early, so you're not just trying to get rebounds above the rim. Matchup-wise, it depends on the game, what the scouting report is. We'll be able to adapt to that.\" A nine-time All-Defensive selection, the aging Paul will rely on his basketball IQ and relentless tenacity to make up for whatever he's lost athletically. The 35-year-old Curry, meanwhile, has continued to add muscle and improve defensively over the latter half of his career. The two will also have the benefit of defensive stalwarts Green, and/or on the floor with them. Watching how Paul fits into a Warriors team seeking another title will be one of the most intriguing early storylines of the 2023-24 season, which begins on Oct. 24 when Golden State hosts Paul's most recent former team, the Phoenix Suns. (The first preseason game will be Saturday night, when the Warriors host the Los Angeles Lakers.) \"That's the beauty and the challenge of what we have in terms of our roster,\" Curry said. \"Because each five that you put out there is going to have a strength and they're going to have a weakness. You have to be able to adapt as we go through.\"",

    "description": "Trump accused Cohen of \"spreading falsehoods\" and causing \"reputational harm\" for talking about hush-money payments to women during Trump's 2016 campaign.",
    "content": "NEW YORK \u2014 Donald Trump dropped his $500 million lawsuit against Michael Cohen, his former lawyer and fixer who is now a key witness in a criminal case against him, Cohen and a Trump spokesperson said Thursday night. The former president did not waive his right to sue again. Trump accused Cohen of \"spreading falsehoods\" \"with malicious intent\" and causing \"vast reputational harm\" for talking publicly about hush-money payments made to women during Trump's 2016 campaign that are at the heart of criminal charges he faces in New York. Trump also accused Cohen of breaking a confidentiality agreement that he signed as a condition of his employment. The former president and GOP front-runner's decision comes days before he was set to give a deposition in the suit brought in April in Florida. That testimony was originally set for Oct. 3, but Trump rescheduled so he could attend the first three days of a separate New York civil fraud trial. Cohen is likely to testify in that trial next week. A Trump spokesperson said Trump decided \"to temporarily pause\" the suit against Cohen as he mounts another campaign for the White House and fights criminal charges in four separate jurisdictions, but said he would refile at a later date. \"Given that President Trump is required to sit for deposition in a civil matter on Columbus Day, when he is scheduled to be in the Great State of New Hampshire, and while the President is fighting against the meritless claims that have been lodged against him in New York, Washington D.C., Florida, and Georgia, as well as continuing his winning campaign \u2026 President Trump has decided to temporarily pause his meritorious claims against Michael Cohen,\" the spokesperson said in a statement. The spokesperson added that once Trump \"has prevailed in dealing with the witch hunts against him, he will continue to pursue his claims against Michael Cohen, who rightfully deserves to, and will be held accountable for his unlawful words and actions just as the Southern District of New York held him accountable for numerous non-Trump related acts and crimes, making Cohen a very 'proud' felon.\" Cohen celebrated the decision, calling the suit \"nothing more than a retaliatory intimidation tactic.\" \"Mr. Trump's cowardly dismissal spells the end of this latest attempt to deter me from providing truthful testimony against him,\" Cohen said in a statement. \"My legal team and I now look forward to turning our full attention to holding Mr. Trump accountable for his latest abuse of the legal system. More to come.\" The lawsuit, filed in Miami, offered a preview of arguments that are sure to be featured in Trump's defense against charges that he falsified internal business records to disguise payments made during the 2016 presidential campaign to silence claims of extramarital sexual encounters. Trump denied any wrongdoing.",

    "description": "Bears legend Dick Butkus dies at 80",
    "content": "Hall of Fame linebacker Dick Butkus, whose name became synonymous with the Chicago Bears and hard-nosed defense, has died, his family announced Thursday. Butkus was 80. \"The Butkus family confirms that football and entertainment legend Dick Butkus died peacefully in his sleep overnight at home in Malibu, California,\" the family said in a statement. \"The Butkus family is gathering with Dick's wife Helen. They appreciate your prayers and support.\" Additional information was not yet provided. The news came less than two hours before the Bears were slated to face the host Washington Commanders in a \"Thursday Night Football\" matchup. Fans at the Commanders' FedEx Field observed a moment of silence for Butkus before the game. \"Dick was the ultimate Bear, and one of the greatest players in NFL history,\" Bears chairman George McCaskey said in a statement. \"He was Chicago's son. He exuded what our great city is about and, not coincidentally, what George Halas looks for in a player: toughness, smarts, instincts, passion and leadership. \"He refused to accept anything less than the best from himself, or from his teammates. ... His contributions to the game he loved will live forever and we are grateful he was able to be at our home opener this year to be celebrated one last time by his many fans.\" NFL commissioner Roger Goodell said in a statement that Butkus \"helped define the linebacker position\" thanks to his intuition and toughness. Born in Chicago, Butkus built his memorable football career in his home state, becoming an All-American at Illinois before joining the Bears in 1965. Butkus became a two-time NFL Defensive Player of the Year (1969, 1970) and an eight-time Pro Bowl selection in a nine-year pro career before going on to work as a broadcaster, pitchman and actor. One popular tale of Butkus' toughness came from a game against the Green Bay Packers in 1970. Butkus was said to have hit Packers quarterback Bart Starr so ferociously that when Starr arose from the turf, he began walking to the wrong bench. Butkus played 119 games for the Bears, tallying 22 interceptions, 27 fumble recoveries and at least 11 sacks during an era when defensive statistics weren't closely kept. He is a member of both the College Football and Pro Football Halls of Fame and was named to the NFL's 100th anniversary team. The annual award for the top linebacker in college football is named after Butkus. \"Some people were made to be doctors, others to be lawyers,\" Butkus once said. \"I was made to play football.\" --Field Level Media Originally published on , part of the .",

    "content": "After director David Gordon Green revived the Halloween franchise with his trilogy of sequels, Universal tapped him to do the same thing with The Exorcist--make a direct sequel to the original film, and get a modern franchise going. And now we have The Exorcist: Believer , positioned as the first entry in a new trilogy (box office performance pending, presumably). Despite that franchise plan, Believer functions in a fairly standalone way, allowing for the possibility of continuing the story while also concluding things in a way that would work pretty well if they don't make any others. It's hard to talk about it in these vague terms, though--it's time to get spoilery. Warning: This article contains spoilers for the entire plot of The Exorcist: Believer, including the ending. The Exorcist: Believer plot recap Believer begins in Haiti, where Victor and his pregnant wife are on their honeymoon. But an earthquake strikes, and she's injured in a building collapse. The doctors tell Victor they can save the mom or the baby, but not both--and he has to choose. Cut to the present day. Victor has a 13-year-old daughter named Angela, and his wife is dead. Angela, naturally, is a little bit obsessed with her mother since she never knew her, and one day she swipes one of her mom's old earrings and goes into the woods with her friend Katherine to do some light ritualizing. They don't seem too serious about it, but the demons hear them anyway. The girls go missing without a trace, and then reappear a few days later in a barn, many miles away, thinking they'd only been gone a few hours. From there we get the standard demonic escalation. They seem relatively normal, but traumatized, at first, and then they gradually get ruder, cruder, and uglier as the demon's presence becomes more obvious in both Angela and Katherine. Victor calls up Chris McNeil, the mom from the original Exorcist. But she isn't able to do much to help aside from hearing some mean comments about her daughter Regan (the girl who was possessed in the original movie) and getting stabbed in both eyes by Katherine. Both things lay out the stakes and the reality of the possession, and so Victor, Katherine's family of evangelicals and their pastor, and some concerned neighbors (a Catholic woman and a Pentecostal man) prepare for the big, climactic exorcism scene. And in addition to the three varieties of Christian, Victor also recruits a pagan priestess to get in on it. There's no Catholic priest involved at first, though, because the local diocese forbade the neighborhood priest from participating. But he believes the possession is real, and as the exorcism begins, he's sitting outside, in his car, praying. Inside, things are going pretty poorly, and the good guys aren't really making any headway. The priest, sensing that, decides to show up and bring the power of Christ with him. So he pops in and starts issuing his rites on the demon-possessed girls. The movie indicates it's working, with the music rising triumphantly as the priest does the whole exorcism routine. But it's just a ruse--the demon doesn't care about the priest's rite of exorcism at all. And it demonstrates that by telekinetically causing the priest's head to turn all the way backwards until he is dead. What happens at the end of The Exorcist: Believer? From there, we get two major developments. First: The demon reveals that Victor told the doctors in Haiti all those years before to save his wife, not his daughter. But her injuries were too severe, and they ended up having to save Angela by default, against Victor's wishes in the moment. The second big thing: The demon says that Angela's and Katherine's parents get to choose which of the two girls gets to live, and which one has the unholy privilege of going back to Hell with the demon. Victor says nothing--he and Katherine's mom agree they can't make that choice, and decide to fight for both of them. But the demon says that if they don't choose, it will take them both. And after some more fun times with demons, Katherine's father gives into temptation and chooses her. From there, everything wraps up pretty quickly. It turns out the demon had tricked them--the one that was chosen would be the one who died, and the other would get to live. So Katherine's spirit is dragged to Hell, and Angela gets to live, just like what happened with Victor's choice all those years before. As horror movie endings go, that's a pretty good one--it's both viscerally disturbing in the moment, and then once those raw feelings fade, it's just depressing. That's great. But knowing that two sequels are on the way changes the perspective a little bit. It's not hard to imagine that this group will run afoul of more demons by trying to find a way to save Katherine from her damnation. That sequel, scheduled for 2025, is already subtitled \"Deceiver\"--a good title for a movie in which the characters wrestle with the consequences of being tricked in such a horrible way. The possibility that Katherine might return from her fate theoretically lessens the emotional impact of this ending, but we've still got a while before we find out anything about Deceiver. And it's likely that the unenthusiastic response to Believer from critics will inspire some kind of adjustment to whatever plans they may have already had for the story. But as it stands now: Angela is alive and recovering from her ordeal, and Katherine is in Hell. But with two more movies coming, it's hardly safe to assume the state of things will stay the same. Does The Exorcist: Believer have a mid-credits or post-credits scene? No, there aren't any extra scenes or any teases for future Exorcist movies during the credits. So once the credits get started, it's safe to head to the bathroom if you need to.",

    "description": "\u201cThe fight is not over and the work is not done.\"",
    "content": "Key figures of the Indigenous \u201cprogressive\u201d opposition to the Voice to Parliament announced this week they would vote Yes in the upcoming referendum to alter the constitution. The moves reflect growing concerns among Indigenous leaders that a national No vote would fuel racist right-wing action and sentiment in the country and inadvertently align their cause with No campaigners like One Nation\u2019s Pauline Hanson and Leader of the Opposition Peter Dutton. Progressive No activists, including First Nations Senator Lidia Thorpe\u2019s Blak Sovereignty Movement, have opposed the Voice in favour of more concrete action and argued for a Treaty-first approach. Thorpe is now one of the few in the movement who has stuck to this hardline stance. Her sister, co-campaigner on the Blak Sovereignty movement and Warriors of Aboriginal Resistance (War) co-founder Meriki Onus, publicly she would change her vote to Yes this week. Speaking with the Sydney Morning Herald, Onus while she agreed with much of the No position, she was now leaning towards voting Yes. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen an example in Australia where a body similar to the Voice to parliament already functions, and I think that they do really good work and there\u2019s amazing opportunity there. So I would be leaning towards a Yes,\u201d she said. WAR community organiser Tarneen Onus Browne has also changed their stance from No to Yes. They told VICE they feared the \u201cmental anguish\u201d caused by a national No vote would harmfully impact Indigenous peoples, as well as lead to the rise of the far-right in Australia. \u201cAs a Black Queer, we went through the plebiscite and it was horrific. The most harmful consequence would be that our people are just absolutely disempowered,\u201d they said. \u201cIt will be a leg up for the \u2018Racist No\u2019 campaign and confirm that they can run a campaign based on misinformation and disinformation and win a national campaign, and the rise of the right wing in Australia.\u201d The Melbourne-based activist said they initially wanted a No because they feared their \u201csovereignty would be compromised\u201d. \u201cI felt like Blackfulla didn't have a choice, and I knew this was happening to us and there was nothing we could do to change it. I saw an opportunity to send messages of strength about First Nations people because we've seen a lot of deficit in the media,\u201d they said. \u201cI have 'come out' to support my mum and dad and my auntys and uncles who are voting Yes to this and the hundreds of Blackfullas I have spoken to on the phone over the last few months.\u201d With the referendum approaching on October 14, other Indigenous leaders have acquiesced to a Yes vote. On Tuesday, Yorta Yorta rapper Briggs a No vote would \u201cdo nothing\u201d. \u201cI feel like it would set us back and does nothing to mend the already fragile and fragmented dialogue Australia already has with Indigenous people,\u201d he told Guardian Australia. \u201cYes is the only way to maintain this idea that we\u2019re still working towards a more unified country and society.\u201d Chief executive of Uprising of the People, Mililma May, the Sydney Morning Herald she had changed her vote to Yes after considering how a No vote would affect her community. \u201cThe idea of a No vote in the Northern Territory scared me in that it could mean a majority of Australians do not care about Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander voices. And that fundamentally felt wrong to me,\u201d she said. \u201cI realised that sovereignty can\u2019t be impacted by voting Yes. And I think it\u2019s healthy to have a level of mistrust of the government, but in a way that can make the government accountable.\u201d For Onus Browne, while a Yes vote isn\u2019t a \u201csilver bullet\u201d, if the public were to vote Yes, \u201cthen a wave of transformative change for First Nations justice will follow\u201d. \u201cPublic momentum and demand give governments a political mandate to act on bold policy reform. This is far from ideal but it is happening, and a No vote will have devastating effects on Indigenous and non-Indigenous communities alike,\u201d they said. \u201cOn their ballot papers, I ask settlers to write Yes to First Nations strength and leadership. And if it is a Yes, Non-Aboriginal people must resist the complacency and the slumber that often happens after historic moments. \u201cThe fight is not over and the work is not done. I ask that your Yes be a commitment too, continuing to support our campaigns, standing alongside us for our fights for justice, and joining us on the streets at our protests, because Yes isn\u2019t enough.\u201d",

    "content": "The entered Thursday night with a 14-game losing streak, the longest active streak in the league and in team history. However, the graciously allowed the visiting Bears to explode out to a 17-0 lead that became a 27-3 halftime edge . Bears wide receiver looked like the second coming of Jerry Rice with 230 receiving yards and three touchdowns, both career-highs which made him the first Chicago player with 200 or more receiving yards and three or more touchdowns in a game since Harlon Hill all the way back in 1954, 12 years before the start of the Era. Given the Bears offensive onslaught and that the Commanders defense has allowed 30 or more points in four straight games, tied for the longest stretch of Ron Rivera's head-coaching career, one of Washington's new owners has already had enough: Magic Johnson. \"Tonight the Commanders played with no intensity or fire,\" the Basketball Hall of Famer and Commanders limited owner . \"We didn't compete in the first half and got down 27-3 heading into halftime. It was too big of a hole to climb out of and that is why we ended up losing 40-20.\" Plays like the one below where Bears running back took a shotgun handoff up the middle for 16 yards on third-and-seven just before halftime probably contributed to raising Johnson's blood pressure during the game. The two highest total value contract on the Commanders payroll below to defensive tackles: (four years, $90 million) and (four years, $72 million). Seeing his team get run over despite the presence of both of those players likely annoys Johnson and the rest of the Commanders fanbase. Khalil Herbert: \u2705 Picked up the first down \u2705 Dragged the defenders for several extra yards on Prime Video Also available on The Bears outran the Commanders by 149 yards, 178 to 29, as Washington quarterback ended up as the team's leading rusher with 19 yards on four carries. According to , Washington dropped back to pass 55 consecutive times without a design run from midway through the second quarter through the end of the game. That marks the most for a team in a game since 2006, the start of PFF's database. Johnson won't be too pleased if he takes a closer look at Thursday's box score.",

    "description": "The brand's first car was launched in October 1955.",
    "content": "Suzuki, the multinational automobile and motorcycle manufacturer headquartered in Shizuoka, Japan, has reached a remarkable milestone by achieving a cumulative worldwide car sales figure of 80 million units by the end of August 2023. The manufacturer currently produces vehicles, bikes, outboard marine engines, and others in 15 production facilities around 10 countries. It sells its products in 184 nations across the globe. Of those 80 million cars delivered so far, 36 percent were sold in Japan, 10 percent in Europe, 13.5 percent in Asia, 32.6 percent in India, and 7.8 percent in the rest of the world. Suzuki 's journey to 80 million units began with the launch of Japan's first mass-production mini-vehicle, the Suzulight, in October 1955. The introduction of the Fronte 800 in 1965 marked the company\u2019s entry into the compact vehicle segment, further expanding its footprint in the global automobile market. Suzuki's reach extended beyond Japan with the start of overseas sales in 1959. In 1975, the company embarked on its first overseas automobile production venture in Pakistan, which marked the beginning of a series of successful overseas production expansions. Key milestones include the establishment of production bases in India in 1983 and Hungary in 1992. Among Suzuki's lineup of mostly small and compact vehicles, the Alto stands out as one of the brand\u2019s all-time hits. Launched in 1979, the model has accounted for a remarkable 20 percent of the 80 million units sold. \u201cWe are grateful to be favored by such many customers. Alto is our top-selling model, and it has played a very significant role in Suzuki\u2019s mini vehicles as well as in the history of the company itself. We will make further efforts to provide value that expresses our manufacturing core of \u201cSho, Sho, Kei, Tan, Bi (Smaller, Fewer, Lighter, Shorter, Beauty)\u201d by standing once again on the origin of \u201ccustomer-focused value\u201d, a spirit which has been passed on from our founder,\u201d Suzuki\u2019s president Osamu Suzuki comments. As the automaker celebrates its 80 million-unit milestone, it is also looking forward to the next generation of one of its most important modern models. The third-generation Suzuki Swift, introduced in 2016, is poised to make way for a next-generation model and ahead of the official unveiling, a concept car was showcased just a few days ago , hinting at what's to come. Suzuki's Future: While officially labeled a concept, this vehicle appeared to be a close preview of the forthcoming production model. Familiar yet evolved, the concept car introduced notable changes, including repositioned rear door handles, fixed glass in the rear doors, and a prominent character line extending from front to rear. Additionally, the \"Hybrid\" badge on the front fender and side mirror-mounted cameras hint at Suzuki's plans to offer an electrified powertrain for the car.",

    "description": "San Jose Sharks close preseason with a 4-3 loss to the Los Angeles Kings at Delta Center in Salt Lake City. Now it's decision time for Mike Grier and David Quinn",
    "content": "It\u2019s a forward line that might just be together for the San Jose Sharks\u2019 season-opening game next week against the Vegas Golden Knights. William Eklund probably wouldn\u2019t mind that birthday present one bit. Eklund started Thursday\u2019s preseason game against the Los Angeles Kings on a line with center Mikael Granlund and Luke Kunin and assisted on a game-tying goal by Thomas Bordeleau in the third period in the Sharks\u2019 4-3 overtime loss at the Delta Center in Salt Lake City. Eklund has now been impressive in three straight exhibition games and after spending most of last season in the AHL, may have just cemented his spot on the Sharks roster to start the regular season. NHL teams have to get their rosters down to 23 players by Monday and it\u2019s not a stretch to say that Eklund will be among the 13 or 14 forwards the Sharks carry into their season-opener next Thursday at home against the defending Stanley Cup champions. Eklund turns 21 that day. \u201cI thought he played another strong game,\u201d Sharks coach David Quinn said of Eklund. \u201cI really liked his game tonight. As we\u2019ve talked about, he\u2019s been trending in the right direction.\u201d Eklund just adds a certain dynamic presence and pizzazz that\u2019s lacking in other parts of the Sharks\u2019 lineup. There\u2019s also a work ethic and a motor that hasn\u2019t stopped for three straight games as he finished the preseason with one goal and two assists. He also killed penalties and was part of the Sharks\u2019 second power-play unit. Bordeleau\u2019s goal came at the 14:15 mark of the third period and was his second in as many preseason games. On the play, Bordeleau chased the puck behind the Kings\u2019 net before Eklund came to support. As Bordeleau went to the front of the net, Eklund found him with a nifty pass that the Michigan product deposited past Los Angeles goalie Pheonix Copley. Did the game clarify things in terms of who will make the team out of training camp, or complicate matters? \u201cI want it to be as complicated as it can be, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d Quinn said. \u201cBut it was going to be complicated regardless of tonight. We knew we were going to have hard decisions and we\u2019ll take the time to make those hard decisions here over the next few days.\u201d To help generate offense, the Sharks are having to get creative in certain areas now that they\u2019re without the services of Erik Karlsson. One of those adjustments, at least for the time being, is having five forwards compromise the first power play unit. The Sharks began to experiment with the unorthodox look in practice this week, gave it a go Thursday in their final game of the preseason, and saw some immediate results. Alexander Barabanov, stationed around the slot area, redirected a pass along the ice from Granlund past Copley at the 17:39 mark of the first period. The Sharks went 1-for-5 with the man advantage. On the first unit were Granlund, Barabanov, Mike Hoffman, Tomas Hertl, and Anthony Duclair. The second unit had forwards Eklund, Bordeleau, Filip Zadina, and Kevin Labanc, and also defenseman Matt Benning. There are plusses and minuses with the five-forward configuration. A positive is that it allows for some more skilled playmakers who are used to having the puck on their stick a chance to get creative. The negatives are that it can result in some dangerous moments for players when they don\u2019t have the puck. They\u2019re not necessarily used to skating backward or defending the net in their own end. Granlund played the role of the power play quarterback to some mixed results. \u201cFor the first time, I thought when we were in the zone, we did a lot of good things,\u201d Quinn said. \u201cWe\u2019ve just got to clean up the other aspects when we don\u2019t have the puck. We\u2019re going to have to play in the neutral zone and we\u2019re going to have to play in the D-zone from time to time and that\u2019s where it really got a little hairy. So, like we talked about when we did this, we\u2019re going t have to be patient, and we\u2019ll clean that up.\u201d Mario Ferraro went after Adrian Kempe in the second period after the Kings forward knocked down Zadina with a late shoulder-to-shoulder hit. But that wasn\u2019t the last scrum of the night. Benning, Zadina, and Kyle Burroughs got into it with Pierre-Luc Dubois, Kevin Fiala, and Mikey Anderson with 49 seconds left in the third period, bringing a rise out of the Delta Center crowd. Related Articles Quinn was asked if he was concerned that Burroughs may have come off the bench outside of what\u2019s allowed by NHL rules. Quinn, though, said Burroughs came on the ice during the course of a normal line change. Six misconduct penalties and four double-minors for roughing were handed out. The fact that the Sharks once again were all in there as a group pleased Quinn. \u201c(Burroughs) didn\u2019t come off the bench for that purpose. I know there was a line change,\u201d Quinn said. \u201cAnytime there\u2019s trouble, five guys have to go to defend each other. It\u2019s not about being the Broad Street bullies. It\u2019s about standing up for your teammate and giving pushback.\u201d",

    "description": "Plus: Here's how we stopped the complaints about our wedding.",
    "content": ": I have two children, ages 5 and 10. I have been a single mother for the past four years after a decade of abuse from their father and a resulting restraining order. The court awarded me sole custody of the children. Unfortunately, both children have their father\u2019s last name. I\u2019m ready to move forward with changing their last names to my surname because I am their mother and sole caregiver. The 5-year-old is too young to remember his father and is as excited as a 5-year-old can be about the change, but the 10-year-old has mixed feelings. I think it\u2019s better to do this change sooner rather than later, though I am cautious of the identity conflict a name change can bring. : You state that you want to move forward with this name change because you are your children\u2019s mother and sole caregiver, but your decision here should be more about them and less about you. I agree that your 10-year-old\u2019s feelings should very much be taken into account as you make this decision. Discuss this privately and maintain an attitude of patient listening. This child has already lost a lot, and holding onto the name might be a way of trying to stem the tide of these losses to maintain a sense of normalcy. Keep in mind that children of abusive parents often find ways to continue to love and long for them. Your 10-year-old may worry that losing the father\u2019s name means finally and forever losing the father. Do not drag their father as you discuss this, but emphasize that you would like all three of you to share the same surname. You might ask both children if they would like to use their father\u2019s surname as a middle name. Related Articles If your older child absolutely does not want to change the surname, do not apply pressure, and hold off on the name change for the younger child. Due to the circumstances here, these two children having different surnames from one another would set them apart in both large and subtle ways. : My mother and father are in their early 70s. I\u2019m very close with both of them. There have been changes to their health over time, with wearing hearing aids, walking more slowly, etc., and I\u2019ve noticed that my mother is getting a little more forgetful lately. The changes aren\u2019t earth-shattering, usually just repeating a recent question or forgetting an answer she\u2019s just received. What\u2019s the \u201cright\u201d way to deal with this when it happens? Do I say, \u201cYou just asked that\u201d Or, \u201cI just told you that?\u201d Or is the proper thing to do to just ignore the fact that it\u2019s repetitive and simply just answer the question again? I don\u2019t want to remind her that she\u2019s getting older. : Your mother knows she\u2019s getting older. She feels the passage of time in large and small ways \u2013 every day. And I have news for you: Getting older is not a bad or shameful topic that must be avoided. Getting older, quite simply, is the privilege of continuing to live in the world. The way to respond to your mother\u2019s forgetfulness is with the utmost patience, followed by a trip to the doctor. Losing one\u2019s memory is a deep and essential fear, and this fear can prevent people from seeking an early diagnosis or treatment for cognitive changes that might be treatable. Your mother\u2019s forgetfulness might be the result of a change of medication, a need for medication, or another treatable or benign cause. : This is in response to who was complaining about destination weddings. My husband and I married in Hawaii many years ago with only our children in attendance. Our families were upset they weren\u2019t invited, but we didn\u2019t want to burden everyone by inviting them to a wedding across the Pacific. So, over several months after our ceremony, we threw smaller wedding parties across the country. We called it our \u201cwedding tour\u201d and the tagline was \u201cbringing the party to you!\u201d It was easier for us and the kids to travel to several locations than it was to try and gather a couple hundred people all in one place. We showed the video of our ceremony, wore our wedding attire, had great food and music, and specified no gifts. The complaints about missing our wedding stopped. : This is great. Related Articles",

    "content": "Suki Waterhouse's boyfriend Robert Pattinson was \"so accepting\" when they moved in together. The couple have been dating since 2018 but they decided to take their relationship to the next level six months ago by setting up home together with the model/actress moving out of her solo apartment and into 'The Batman' star's home - and she says he was incredibly patient after she brought \"mess and chaos\" with her. Speaking on Apple\u2019s 'Driven Minds: A Type 7' podcast, she explained: \"I\u2019ve been having such a crushing weight of anxiety because I've moved. I wasn't there for the move, so everything just got boxed up and sent ... [It was a challenge because] because I've moved in with my boyfriend now, and I always used to live alone. \"It doesn't feel like that much of a crazy thing. And I'm very lucky because he is so accepting of the mess and the chaos. He never says anything about it. He kind of thinks it\u2019s like, charming. So I'm very lucky for that.\" Suki, 31, went on to add the relationship came along at the right time for her after previous bad experiences with men left her vowing to stay single. She said: \"I've been ghosted and broken up with after dating someone for a year, that was pretty bad. But it turned out to be brilliant because I took it like a bout of celibacy. \"[I dated people who were] just cheating on you all the time. It's really f***** up.\" However, she added of her romance with the 'Harry Potter' star: \"Maybe for me, it was about actually feeling ready in a way that I haven't before, that I actually had something to give. I've sat with myself - have been in a couple of different kinds of relationships. \"I actually have something to share now. I have, like, a life that I'm proud of that I want to share with someone and I'm stable and I have my s*** together.\"",

    "content": "Victoria Beckham's wedding dress flew across the Atlantic on Concorde four times. The Spice Girls star married former footballer David Beckham in a lavish ceremony at Luttrellstown Castle in Ireland in July 1999 and she wore a Champagne-coloured gown with an intricate corset which was a collaboration between Vera Wang and UK-based costumier Mister Pearl - and it meant the bodice had to whizz back and forth between New York and London many times. Vera told PEOPLE: \"I call it the transatlantic dress. That bodice flew back and forth four times on the Concorde. The actual under bodice was made by a very famous couture corsetiere named Mister Pearl, who works only out of London.\" She added of the corset-maker's styles: \"He makes corsets that have to be pulled [in] with these metal things, which is how corsets were done in the old days. It takes about 45 minutes to lace up, and it can take your waist down to literally 18 inches [like] Scarlett O'Hara. \"I could not live with that because I need to be comfortable, as I always say. But Victoria did.\" Vera added that she visited Victoria in London for one of the fittings, while the pop star also came to New York twice. However, the dress project had to be put on hold after Victoria discovered she was pregnant with her first child, son Brooklyn, and the wedding had to be delayed. Vera added: \"We delayed the wedding for two years. Then we resumed, or maybe a year and a half. So that is [what] I call the transatlantic wedding with Victoria and David.\" Victoria wore the custom gown for the ceremony and later changed into a bright purple dress - matching the groom's suit and baby Brooklyn's outfit. Speaking in his new Netflix documentary 'Beckham', David admitted he let Victoria make all the decisions when it came to organising their big day. He said: \"I tried to think back to when I decided to wear a purple suit. I don't know when that happened. I think I just took Victoria's lead on it. But what \u2026 what were we thinking?\" However, Victoria has no regrets over the glitzy ceremony, saying: \"It was fun! ... We weren't worried about what people were going to say. I mean Christ, how lovely to be that way when you just don't really care you just want to express yourselves.\"",

    "content": "Jamie Spears is \"severely ill\" in hospital. The showbiz patriarch - who was co-conservator over daughter Britney Spears' affairs for 13 years until September 2021 - has reportedly spent \"weeks\" in a medical facility receiving treatment for an infection. A source told the New York Post newspaper's Page Six column: \u201cJamie has been suffering with a bad infection that has required surgery. \"He has been hospitalized for weeks in a special infectious disease facility.\u201d A second insider told the outlet that Jamie is \"severely ill\", but suggestions he had been to rehab over the summer are untrue. In August, TMZ reported the 72 year old had been hospitalised \"several months\" earlier when doctors were concerned he had a problem with his kidney, but it turned out to be a \"terrible infection\" in his knee, 16 years after having the joint replaced. Insiders told the site at the time Jamie was preparing for more surgery, where doctors would try to clear the infection from the knee. He is said to be \"extremely thin\" after losing over 25lbs due to his medical issues. It was also claimed that Jamie's health problems had made Britney think about reconciling with her father, who she has been estranged from since her conservatorship - which she was highly critical of - ended. The 41-year-old pop star is currently in touch with just one member of her family \u2013 her older brother, Bryan Spears. The \u2018Baby One More Time\u2019 singer has stayed close to her older sibling Bryan throughout her long-running battle to free herself from her family\u2019s conservatorship over her life and $60 million, which was legally ended in April, and he temporarily moved in with her in the Los Angeles mansion she shared with her estranged husband Sam Asghari, 29. A source told Page Six: \u201cHe\u2019s been staying over and helping her alongside a therapist.\u201d The insider added Bryan\u2019s presence \u201ca great thing for all of\u201d Britney\u2019s family. Britney briefly reunited with her mother Lynne Spears, 68, in May, but sources told the outlet there is \u201cstill a lot of hurt there\u201d and they \u201chaven\u2019t quite reconciled\u201d.",

    "content": "Travis Kelce's mom feels she is in an \"alternate universe\" hanging out with Taylor Swift. The NFL star is believed to have been romancing the 'Bad Blood' hitmaker for the last few months and the 33-year-old pop star has been spending time with his mother Donna Kelce watching his Kansas City Chiefs games, and the matriarch admitted it has been a surreal experience getting so much public attention. Appearing on the 'Got It From My Momma' podcast, Donna said: \u201cI feel like I\u2019m in an alternate universe, because it\u2019s something I\u2019ve never been involved with before.\" Donna admitted the last few weeks have been a \"whirlwind\" and she is surprised the speculation surrounding Travis and Taylor's rumoured relationship has yet to die down. She said: \u201cI thought it would be over at that point, but it seems to just continue, and every week just seems to trump the week before. \u201cSo it\u2019s really kind of wild, a wild ride.\u201d But Donna thinks it is \"pretty cool\" that some young girls have developed an interest in football as a result of Taylor's appearances in the crowd and admitted the NFL have been cashing in on the attention. She said: \u201cAll I can tell you is that the NFL is laughing all the way to the bank. You know what I\u2019m saying? Good for them. They\u2019re getting the ramifications of everything. \u201cI can tell you this, that they\u2019ve told me personally that the Kelce family has done more good PR for football than they could have paid a $1 million to a PR firm.\u201d Donna's comments came after Travis, 33, and his brother Jason, 35, joked they had been \"put on the map\" because of the 'Lover' singer. The brothers announced on Wednesday (04.10.23) their \u2018New Heights\u2019 podcast has reached No1 across various platforms thanks to what\u2019s been called the \u201cTaylor effect\u201d. Philadelphia Eagles star Jason said: \u201cWe are officially on the map. Both Travis and I have officially been put on the map.\u201d Travis replied: \u201cJust when you think you been skatin\u2019 away from it.\u201d Crediting Taylor for the uplift in their numbers, Jason joked: \u201cNothing out of the ordinary from week tree, so can\u2019t really explain why the boost in viewership, but we appreciate you guys tuning in.\u201d",

    "description": "Mickel Cherry faces one count of capital murder and one count each of first-degree murder and rape in the death of Zoey Felix.",
    "content": "A 25-year-old man was charged Thursday in the rape and killing of a 5-year-old Kansas girl who died despite firefighters' efforts to save her life in a gas station parking lot. Mickel Cherry faces one count of capital murder - which would allow prosecutors to seek the death penalty - and one count each of first-degree murder and rape in the on Monday. He was jailed in Topeka on a $2 million bond, and his next court appearance has not yet been determined. Shawnee County District Attorney Michael Kagay told reporters that a decision about seeking a death sentence won't be made until after a preliminary hearing to determine whether Cherry stands trial. That is standard in capital cases. Mark Manna, of the Kansas Death Penalty Defense Unit, said his office would represent Cherry, but that he had no further comment. Cherry's family didn't respond to messages. Authorities have released no details about the cause of Zoey's death, but former neighbors of the girl and her family believe she, her father and Cherry had lived the past few weeks in a grove of trees on a wooded lot near the gas station, just blocks from the home where her mother lived. They believed she was carried from the wooded lot to the gas station, but police have not confirmed any of those details. Kagay said in a news release that Topeka police rushed to a gas station where fire crews were attempting to save Zoey's life. She was later pronounced dead. A medical examination at the hospital revealed injuries consistent with sexual assault. \"I think the investigation into the murder and rape of this 5-year-old girl is fairly complete,\" Kagay told reporters during a brief news conference. Asked about potentially charging other people, Kagay said, \"I'm willing to consider any actionable investigations brought to me,\" but when he was asked whether he is aware of any other investigations, he said, \"I'm not.\" Timothy Phelps, deputy director of the Shawnee County Department of Corrections, confirmed that Cherry used to live at the same address as Zoey, but at the time of his arrest, Cherry was homeless. Cherry has no criminal record in Kansas, but he does have a misdemeanor criminal trespass conviction in Amarillo, Texas. Neighbors said they had raised concerns that Zoey's family home had no electricity and that they called the police and child welfare. \"She just had a good spirit to her. Honestly, very outgoing, smart. She was curious about everything. She'd ask you a 1,001 questions, and she demanded answers for those too,\" said Shaniqua Bradley, a neighbor. Neighbor Desiree Myles that Zoey was a \"loving girl.\" \"Love the children, all the kids play with her,\" she told the station. \"They all looked out for everybody, looked out for Zoey. She was a Curious George with nowhere to go. Nowhere to go.\" Topeka police confirmed Thursday that they made three visits to the home in September: one on Sept. 5 for a welfare check following a report that the home had no electricity; and two domestic disturbance calls in the afternoon and evening of Sept. 19, a little more than an hour apart. Police did not provide details about those two calls. City spokeswoman Gretchen Spiker said in an email that during the first call officers confirmed there was no electricity and that they were told the child wasn't staying there. Police met with the child, saw she was in \"good spirits\" but still made a report to child welfare and property officials, Spiker said. Kansas Department of Children and Families leaders for their lack of intervention following reports from police, WIBW reported. The city moved to condemn the house but backed off when the utilities were turned back on. Neighbors said that everyone but the mother had moved out by then. One tent and a tarp were set up in the woods a few blocks away from the home, in an area about a football field away from the pumps at a Dillons grocery store where fire crews tried to resuscitate Zoey. Her dad worked at the gas station; a coworker said Wednesday that he was taking time off and the company hasn't responded to an email from The Associated Press. A makeshift memorial of flowers, balloons and toys sat nearby. A held a candlelight vigil on Wednesday night to support survivors of sexual assault, WIBW reported.",

    "content": "The round bottom of a proper wok is the key to a decent stir fry, but it also makes it hard to use on traditional Western stoves. That\u2019s why many woks end up in a dark kitchen cabinet, unused and unloved. But wait; it turns out that the round bottom of a wok is \u2014 radio waves, specifically the 21-cm neutral hydrogen emissions coming from the heart of our galaxy. Turning a wok into an entry-level radio telescope doesn\u2019t appear to be all that hard, at least judging by what [Leo W.H. Fung] detail in (PDF) on \u201cWTH\u201d or \u201cWok the Hydrogen.\u201d Aside from the wok, which serves as the main reflector, you\u2019ll need a bit of coaxial cable and some stiff copper wire to fashion a small dipole antenna and balun, plus some plastic tubing to support it at the focal point of the reflector. Measuring the wok\u2019s shape and size, which in turn determines its focal point, is probably the hardest part of the build; luckily, the paper includes tips on doing just that. The authors address the controversy of parabolic versus spherical reflectors and arrive at the conclusion that for a radio telescope fashioned from a wok, it just doesn\u2019t matter. As for the signal processing chain, WTH holds few surprises. A Nooelec Sawbird+ H1 acts as preamp and filter for the 1420-MHz hydrogen line signal, which feeds into an RTL-SDR dongle. Careful attention is paid to proper grounding and shielding to keep the noise floor as low as possible. Mounting the antenna is a decidedly ad hoc affair, and aiming is as simple as eyeballing various stars near the center of the galactic plane \u2014 no need to complicate things. Performance is pretty good: WTH measured the recession velocity of neutral hydrogen to within 20 km/s, which isn\u2019t bad for something cobbled together from scrap. We\u2019ve seen plenty of before, but WTH probably wins the \u201cget on the air tonight\u201d award. Thanks to [Heinz-Bernd Eggenstein] for the tip.",

    "content": "Apple rolled out iOS 17.0.3 earlier this week, a release that brings over fixes for the overheating problems that some iPhone 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max users reported since the handsets were released. The software patch doesn\u2019t reduce the performance of the powerful A17 Pro, just like said. We already saw that prove that. Sign up for the most interesting tech & entertainment news out there. By signing up, I agree to the and have reviewed the But does the software fix actually solve the overheating issue? Thermal testing performed before and after the iOS 17.0.3 shows the iPhone 15 Pros aren\u2019t getting hot after the fix. That\u2019s exactly the kind of news we\u2019ve been expecting. iPhone 15 Pro users who ran into overheating issues described various scenarios where the handset would overheat. One concerns the A17 Pro chip running high-end games. The new Pros also overheated while the battery was charging. Or while owners used them as the phones were connected to a charger. Like other reviewers, ran into an overheating issue involving fast charging. The blog used a thermal camera to measure the temperature. It recorded a 107.1\u00baF temperature when the handset charged with a 35W charging brick. The iPhone 15 officially supports 20W fast charging, but unofficially it can approach 30W speeds. You can recharge the iPhone with any USB-C charger that exceeds 20W power to take advantage of even faster charging. also found the handset to overheat while jumping between camera apps while shooting content outdoors on an 82\u00baF day. Apple explained that an iOS 17 bug and issues with certain third-party apps could lead to overheating. The company said the titanium frame and the USB-C port were not responsible for the extra heat. After applying the iOS 17.0.3 update, retested the iPhone 15 Pro models. They used the same parameters and equipment, as well as the same location as earlier tests. This time, the did not exceed 93.8\u00baF while charging with the same 35W charger. also notes that other iPhone and Android phones reach temperatures between 85\u00baF and 95\u00baF when fast charging. The Galaxy Fold 5 was the hottest, with a temperature of 98.7\u00baF. This is just one test involving a thermal camera, but it seems the iOS 17.0.3 patch fixed the iPhone 15 Pro overheating issues. Like before, I\u2019ll warn you that you might experience overheating during intensive gaming sessions. But that\u2019s normal behavior for any smartphone. What\u2019s important here is for the iPhone to continue to be comfortable to use even during long gaming sessions.",

    "description": "More than a third of credit cards now carry APRs of nearly 30%. But to get a lower rate, often all you have to do is ask.",
    "content": "Credit card interest rates have soared to levels usually reserved for people with severely damaged credit. Indeed, more than one in three cards carry annual percentage rates (APRs) of 29.99% or higher, according to an analysis by LendingTree. The average interest rate on a new credit card offer is up to 24.45% \u2014 the highest level since the online lending marketplace began tracking interest rates across 200 cards. The upshot: Not paying your credit card balance each month adds up fast. \"There are very few things in life that are more expensive than having crummy credit,\" LendingTree credit analyst Matt Schulz told CBS MoneyWatch. \"It will cost you thousands of dollars over the course of your life in the form of higher interest rates, more fees on mortgage and car loans, and it can push your insurance premiums higher.\" How to return gifts purchased using buy now, pay later plans 3 ways to cut your credit card debt A card's APR determines how much interest the cardholder will be charged if they don't pay off their balance in full at the end of each month. The good news is that if you pay your balance in full each month, these rates don't go into effect. \"But that's not the reality for a whole lot of cardholders in this country,\" Schulz said. \"However, if you have decent credit, there are options you have to potentially improve your interest rates.\" Can I get a lower rate? For folks struggling with debt, consider a card that offers 0% interest on balance transfers for an introductory period. Also reach out to your credit card issuer and ask for a lower interest rate. A LendingTree survey from earlier this year found that 76% of people who asked for a lower rate got one. The average reduction was roughly six percentage points. Are medical credit cards worth it? 03:14 \"It can be scary to pick up the phone and negotiate with a giant bank, but your chances of success are better than you realize,\" Schulz said. And as always, Improve your credit score by paying your bills on time, keeping your balance as low as possible and not applying for too much credit too often, Schulz said.

    "description": "The U.N. human rights office says \"indications are that it was a Russian missile\" that struck Ukrainians gathered to mourn a fallen soldier.",
    "content": "Families in the small northeast Ukrainian village of Hroza were trying to process horror and loss Friday morning after a Russian rocket strike hit a grocery store and caf\u00e9 , killing at least 51 of the town's remaining 300 or so inhabitants. Thousands of people had already fled the Kharkiv region, where Hroza is located, close to the Russian border, since Russian President Vladimir Putin launched his full-scale assault on Ukraine in February 2022. Dozens of people, including children, had gathered Thursday afternoon for a wake to remember a fallen soldier's life, when their own lives were suddenly cut short by the rocket strike. \"We only found bits and pieces of some bodies,\" said Kharkiv's chief police investigator Serhii Bolvinov. A teddy bear and flowers are seen placed on rubble as Ukrainian emergency personnel clear debris at the site of a Russian strike that hit a shop and caf\u00e9 in the village of Groza, in Ukraine's Kharkiv region, Oct. 6, 2023. GENYA SAVILOV/AFP/Getty Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned the \"demonstrably brutal Russian crime\" and vowed that his own forces would \"respond to the terrorists\" powerful.\" There was another missile attack Friday in the city of Kharkiv, only about 50 miles northwest of Hroza, which killed a 10-year-old boy and his grandmother, Ukraine's Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko said on the Telegram messaging app. Associated Press journalists said they saw emergency crews pulling the boy's body, wearing Spider-Man pajamas, from a building destroyed in the early morning strike. \"Indications are that it was a Russian missile.\" Elizabeth Throssell, spokeswoman for the United Nations human rights office, told journalists Friday in Geneva that while it was \"very difficult to establish with absolute certainty what happened\" in Hroza, \"given the location, given the fact that the caf\u00e9 was struck, the indications are that it was a Russian missile.\" The office of Volker Turk, the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), deployed a field team on Friday \"to speak to survivors and gather more information\" on the attack, with a spokesperson for his office saying he was \"profoundly shocked and condemns these killings.\" The missile strike was the bloodiest single attack in 16 months and it came as a poll showed U.S. public support for sending more aid to Ukraine falling \u2014 down 5% since the summer to 41%. With additional U.S. funding for Ukraine currently frozen amid the ongoing federal budget battle in Washington, Ukrainian congresswoman Oleksandra Ustinova told CBS News she was \"100% worried\" about the future of American support for her country, as it battles to fend off Russia's 20-month-long, full-scale invasion. \"The most needed types of weapons right now for us is the air defense missiles,\" she told CBS News. \"If we don't have any more of those coming, we would have hundreds and thousands of civilians dead this winter.\" Any additional defenses that could have bolstered the chances of survival in the village of Hroza will come too late. Russia considers bailing on nuclear test ban treaty The speaker of Russia's lower house of parliament, meanwhile, has echoed Putin's own remarks, saying the country's lawmakers would \"definitely discuss the issue of revoking ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty\" during their next session. \"This is in line with the national interests of our state,\" said State Duma speaker Vyacheslav Volodin, calling it \"a mirror response to the United States, which has not yet ratified the treaty.\" The U.S. did sign onto the treaty banning nuclear weapons tests in 1996, but Congress has never ratified it. Putin said Thursday that, \"theoretically, it is possible to revoke ratification\" of the treaty, which Russia's government ratified in 2000.

    "description": "Kaleb Elarms-Orr is second in the Pac-12 in tackles in his first season as a starter with the Cal Bears after the Moreau Catholic High product played sparingly as a freshman in 2022.",
    "content": "BERKELEY \u2014 Even before there was any tangible evidence suggesting it might happen, Cal inside linebacker Kaleb Elarms-Orr has always had confidence he will someday play in the NFL. He believed it at Moreau Catholic High School in Hayward, where he was a three-star prospect at a different position, projected to play on the edge or outside linebacker. He believed it his freshman season at Cal, even while rehabbing a torn ACL he suffered during a spring 2021 senior season at Moreau. And he kept the faith last fall as an anonymous special teams player. \u201cI always believed in myself. Always believed that I was going to do good things,\u201d Elarms-Orr said. \u201cI knew I had tools to be somewhat good. I\u2019ve just got to keep working hard. \u201cNot to be cocky or overly confident, but I\u2019m confident in what I do. I\u2019ve always believed I could make the NFL, it\u2019s just a matter of time.\u201d He\u2019s not there yet, but from zero tackles in 10 games as a third- or fourth-stringer a year ago, the 6-foot-2, 230-pound redshirt sophomore is No. 2 in the Pac-12, averaging 9.4 tackles through five games. He comes off a career-high 15 tackles vs. Arizona State and had 13 against Auburn several weeks back. Elarms-Orr and the Bears (3-2, 1-1 Pac-12) will get a stiff test Saturday night at Memorial Stadium against No. 15 Oregon State (4-1, 1-1), which boasts a top running back in 2022 Pac-12 Freshman of the Year Damien Martinez and a veteran offensive line. \u201cThat\u2019s really the engine of the whole operation,\u201d Cal defensive coordinator and inside linebackers coach Peter Sirmon said the Beavers\u2019 offensive line. \u201cThere\u2019s no dents in the armor.\u201d \u201cTheir line\u2019s good,\u201d Elarms-Orr confirmed. \u201cYou can tell they\u2019re very well-coached. They\u2019re going to work hard and be fast and be physical. We\u2019ve got to be the same as a defense.\u201d Elarms-Orr is most often answering the call so far in his first full season as a position player for the Bears. \u201cI know he\u2019s gaining confidence because he is producing,\u201d Cal coach Justin Wilcox said. \u201cI hope, like we do, he sees he\u2019s not close to his ceiling and if he reaches it then he could be a really good player. \u201cHe\u2019s still young and he\u2019s still learning but it\u2019s great to be learning when you\u2019re having that much production.\u201d Elarms-Orr says he\u2019s taking it game by game, trying not to focus on stats but merely doing what he can to help the Bears win. He said it\u2019s a been a huge benefit having Jackson Sirmon, a fifth-year senior and All-Pac-12 player, lining up next to him inside. \u201cI\u2019m learning from my mistakes every game \u2014 what to do and what not to do,\u201d he said. He made one in the first quarter during Cal\u2019s 24-21 win over ASU last week, misreading a play that allowed wide receiver Melquan Stovall to gain 34 yards after a short pass completion. Elarms-Orr declined to lean on inexperience as an excuse. \u201cI could have been better at handling the route \u2014 that\u2019s not on anybody else but me. I\u2019m going to definitely learn from that.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve got to clean that up. I think we can. He has the ability to do these things,\u201d said Wilcox, describing Elarms-Orr as explosive, tough and fast. Peter Sirmon says the dramatic improvement is the result of Elarms-Orr dedicating himself to learning the position last offseason. That involved hours watching tape to better understand what he was seeing. \u201cWhat he did in the winter and what we saw in the spring kind of catapulted him into what he\u2019s doing now,\u201d Sirmon said. \u201cI\u2019m not actually that surprised by his production. He has very, very good tools. \u201cAs he develops, the thing he can\u2019t rush is just getting more experience.\u201d Elarms-Orr concedes he\u2019s something of a perfectionist, which can be a double-edged sword as he continues to ascend. \u201cI feel like I can improve everything,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m just very hungry. I\u2019m striving to be the best.\u201d",

    "description": "Autumn brings pears. We\u2019ve been missing them. For a stellar dessert, poach them and let them steep in a bright yellow saffron-ginger syrup.",
    "content": ", Most of the time, I take a very casual approach to having guests for dinner. I don\u2019t mind doing a little cooking while people hang out in the kitchen; in fact, I enjoy it. But sometimes, it\u2019s more relaxing to have the entire menu ready, especially if some of it can be cooked a day in advance. This is one of those menus. It takes a little work to put together, but comes with great reward: There\u2019s barely any last-minute fussing. In Morocco \u2014 and similarly throughout the Middle East \u2014 the most delicious salads are made with seasoned, cooked vegetables, not leafy greens. For a first course, I made a smoky eggplant salad with cilantro, infused with cumin, hot pepper and a generous amount of olive oil. It\u2019s a winning combination. Seriously blackening the eggplants \u2014 preferably very firm ones, with fewer seeds \u2014 under the broiler achieves the perfect smoky flavor. Once they collapse from the intense heat, you scrape away the charred skin, then shred and dress the steamed flesh. The salad will keep, refrigerated, for several days. Serve at room temperature with radishes, olives and a crusty loaf or toast. For an impressive make-ahead main course, I wanted a savory vegetable pie, modeled after the classic Moroccan b\u2019stilla, usually made with squab, pigeon or chicken. It isn\u2019t traditional, of course, but this vegetarian version is quite delicious, flaky, buttery and fragrant with spices. The filling here is made with a highly seasoned pairing of butternut squash and plenty of caramelized onion, currants, fried almonds and ras el hanout, a Moroccan mix of warm spices. A diced preserved lemon adds perfume and sharpness, but you can also use a regular lemon. Traditional b\u2019stilla has a layer of scrambled egg, replaced here with a mixture of thick yogurt and feta. As with the original, everything is encased in golden, crisp buttered phyllo, sprinkled with powdered sugar and cinnamon and served piping hot. As a bonus, the pie may be assembled and refrigerated unbaked, for up to two days. Autumn brings pears. We\u2019ve been missing them. For a stellar dessert, poach them and let them steep in a bright yellow saffron-ginger syrup. Saffron, though burdened with a reputation of being \u201cthe most expensive spice in the world,\u201d is a spice you need in your cupboard. A little goes a long way: A quarter teaspoon will not break the bank, and you can often find small containers of saffron threads more affordably at an Indian or Middle Eastern grocery. You can poach your pears several days ahead of serving and store them in their syrup; they\u2019ll only improve in flavor. Served chilled with a dab of creme fraiche or a scoop of vanilla ice cream, this dessert is sheer luxury. Autumn light, autumn air, autumn gathering. Breathe it in. By David Tanis 6 servings 30 minutes, plus at least 15 minutes\u2019 cooling 1. Heat a broiler or grill to high. Using the tip of a sharp knife, poke the eggplant skin in a few places to prevent them from bursting. Broil or grill the whole eggplants, occasionally turning with tongs, until the skins blacken all over and start to collapse \u2013 they should be very soft when probed with a fork, about 10 to 15 minutes. 2. Carefully cut hot eggplants in half vertically, and leave to cool cut side up on a baking sheet or cutting board for at least 15 minutes. 3. In a small bowl, using a fork, whisk together olive oil, lemon juice, garlic and cumin. Season with salt and pepper. 4. Remove and discard the charred eggplant skin, scraping with a small knife. Cut off and discard stem end of eggplant. Tear or slice eggplant into 1 1/2-by-1/2-inch strips. Discard any large seed pockets. Place strips in a bowl. 5. Season eggplant with salt and pepper. Add dressing, cilantro and minced pepper. Toss gently and let sit for at least 10 minutes. Transfer to a serving platter, sprinkle with a pinch of red-pepper flakes and garnish with sprigs of cilantro. Serve at cool room temperature. Accompany with radishes and olives, if desired, and top with cilantro sprigs. By David Tanis 6 to 8 servings 2 hours, plus 15 minutes\u2019 resting 1. Heat 3 tablespoons olive oil in a skillet over medium-high. Add almonds and fry gently for about 2 minutes, until fragrant and beginning to brown. Set aside to cool, then rough chop in a food processor (or hand chop) and season with salt. Set aside. 2. In a Dutch oven or heavy skillet, warm remaining 1/4 cup olive oil over medium-high heat. Add onion and cook, stirring, until lightly browned and softened, about 10 minutes. 3. Add squash, season well with salt and pepper, and stir to coat. Add 1/2 cup water, cover pot and cook until squash is tender, about 10 minutes. 4. Add currants, chopped lemon, cumin, turmeric, ras el hanout and cayenne, and mix gently to incorporate. Transfer mixture to a baking sheet and spread out to allow to cool to room temperature. Taste and adjust seasoning. It should be highly seasoned. (The filling can be made up to 2 days in advance, covered and refrigerated. Allow to come to room temperature before continuing.) 5. Heat the oven to 375 degrees. 6. Build the pie: Using a pastry brush, butter a 9-inch springform pan. Lay a sheet of phyllo across the pan and press down so it covers the bottom and the edges overhang. Paint or drizzle more butter over the sheet, including the overhang. Layer another sheet over, slightly rotated, and press down. Continue until you have a total of 6 sheets, rotating slightly and buttering each layer, leaving the edges overhanging. 7. Spread bottom of pan with the reserved chopped almonds, then spoon in squash mixture and spread to an even thickness. Beat the eggs into the yogurt, then pour over squash mixture and top with feta. 8. Cover with 4 more sheets of phyllo dough, buttering between layers. Gather overhanging sheets, a few layers at a time, folding them to the center and pressing down to smooth (it\u2019s OK if the top sheets crack a little). Lightly butter the top. Pie may now be refrigerated for up to 2 days, or proceed with baking. 9. Place the pan on a foil-lined baking sheet. Bake for 45 minutes to 1 hour, until crisp and golden. Let rest at least 15 minutes. 10. To serve, unmold and dust top generously with powdered sugar. Sprinkle with pinches of cinnamon. By David Tanis 6 servings 45 minutes, plus overnight cooling 1. Peel the pears, leaving stems intact. 2. Put wine, sugar, saffron and ginger in a stainless-steel saucepan or skillet just large enough to hold the pears in a single layer over high heat. Stir and bring to a boil. 3. Add pears and reduce to a simmer. Cover and cook gently for about 20 minutes (turning occasionally if the pears aren\u2019t fully submerged), until pears are just tender when poked with a skewer or a small, sharp knife. If time permits, allow pears to cool in their syrup in the refrigerator, preferably overnight or for up to several days. 4. Remove pears from syrup. Simmer syrup down to a thick glaze over brisk heat, about 15 minutes. Let cool slightly (about 10 minutes) and pour over pears to serve. Pair with creme fraiche or vanilla ice cream.",

The likes of Bella Heathcote ( Bloom ), Bryan Brown ( Bloom ), Erik Thomson ( Black Snow ), Ben O\u2019Toole ( Hacksaw Ridge ), Lincoln Younes ( After the Verdict ), Alexander England ( Black Snow ) appear alongside Penn, Gurry and Fox in the show. \u201cWhen you grow up down under in Australia, dreaming of someday telling stories on screen, Cannes, holds a magical, almost mythical place in your creative heart, like Valhalla or heaven,\u201d said Gurry. \u201cTo be invited to Mipcom to speak about this project is truly an unimaginable honour and a thrill beyond words. Europe\u2019s history of storytelling is baked into every stone in its streets and every brick on its ancient monuments, you can hear the whispers of great story tellers from literally thousands of years ago\u2026 I cannot wait to add a few whispers to that rich history.\u201d \u201cFremantle is delighted to showcase C*A*U*G*H*T at MIPCOM and welcome these incredible international talents onto the iconic global stage where in a world first will together discuss this remarkably bold, ambitious, and highly entertaining series. Matthew, Sean, and Kick in Cannes presenting C*A*U*G*H*T is a must-see event,\u201d said Jens Richter, CEO Commercial and International at Fremantle, commented: Billed as \u201cthe mother of all entertainment content markets,\u201d the 39 th edition of MIPCOM CANNES (16-October 2023) will gather more than 10,000 senior international television producers, buyers, commissioners and creatives from the industry\u2019s major studios and platforms worldwide. More than 250 exhibiting studios and distributors from 45 countries are confirmed for the annual International Co-Production and Entertainment Content Market. In Cannes, Fremantle will also be launching Alice & Jack , the Channel 4 and Masterpiece drama starring Andrea Riseborough and Domhnall Gleeson, and will hold a special presentation on Neighbours , following its dramatic demise and rise this year. Exec producer Jason Herbison and stars Annie Jones and Tim Kano will discuss the power of IP to streamers, and how fans helped saved the hit series. Amazon\u2019s Freevee revived the show and rebooted it earlier this year after Channel 5\u2019s decision to ditch its investment in the long-running Australian soap led to a cancellation. The 39th Mipcom runs from October 16-19, with more than 250 exhibiting studios and distributors from 45 countries expected to attend.",

    "description": "An experienced trail runner who is familiar with the park, Chad Pallansch set out Sept. 27 on what was intended to be a one-day, 28-mile loop.",
    "content": "A rugged section of Rocky Mountain National Park has been closed during the search for a trail runner missing for more than a week. The area of about 5 square miles was made off limits to the public starting at 6 p.m. Thursday, Oct. 5, to minimize scent distractions for dogs being used in the search for Chad Pallansch, said officials at the Colorado park. An experienced trail runner who is familiar with the park, Pallansch, 49, set out Sept. 27 on what was intended to be a one-day, 28-mile loop out of Grand Lake. The last contact from him was a text message he sent around noon indicating he was almost to the 13,310-foot summit of Mount Alice \u2014 his intended high point, and about 10 miles into the loop. Though much of his route was in remote and even trailless high country, had he made it 17 miles he would have been close to Bear Lake, a popular day trip destination. Pallansch was reported overdue on Sept. 28, and park rangers found his vehicle parked at a trailhead near Grand Lake. The closure area, just west of Longs Peak, includes Mount Alice, McHenrys Peak and the upper end of the North Inlet drainage. Wintry weather, including snow and strong winds, has hindered the search this week, park officials reported. On Tuesday, Trail Ridge Road \u2014 the park\u2019s highway over the Continental Divide \u2014 was closed because of snow and ice. Pallansch is believed to have been dressed for temperatures in the 40s. He carried a navigation device but without emergency communication capability. Pallansch lives in Fort Collins, a 90-mile drive from Grand Lake. His social media profiles say he works as a software engineer at Hewlett-Packard.",

    "description": "Jackman is writing this book now 'because he\u2019s finally (being) honest with himself and (his) divorce' from Deborra-Lee Furness, a source says in a new report.",
    "content": "Hugh Jackman reportedly has some \u201cbombshell\u201d secrets about his life that he plans to share in a new memoir he\u2019s been working on since he and his wife Deborra-Lee Furness announced their split after 27 years of marriage. Thursday that the Australian actor, 54, is in the early stages of writing a tell-all book, a process that has been \u201chealing\u201d for him as the book promises to deliver some \u201cbombshell\u201d revelations. \u201cThe content will be Hugh speaking about his life,\u201d a source told Us Weekly. \u201cHe\u2019ll be opening up about his life like never before.\u201d Fans, of course, will wonder what these \u201cbombshell\u201d revelations involve. Could the \u201cX-Men\u201d actor open up about the reasons that he and Furness, 67, split? Yes, according to Us Weekly, whose source said: \u201cHugh\u2019s choosing to (write this book) now because he\u2019s finally (being) honest with himself (and his) divorce\u201d and \u201cthis book is the first step.\u201d In April, Jackman and Furness celebrated their anniversary and Jackman had posted a gushing tribute to his wife on Instagram, \u201cI love you Deb. Today is our 27th wedding anniversary. 27 years! I love you so much,\u201d the actor wrote in his caption. But five months later, news broke about their divorce, and about how Jackman and Furness\u2019 marriage had been a \u201csham\u201d all along. Over the years, the couple have responded to persistent speculation that Jackman is secretly gay. They often have used humor to push back against such \u201cmean-spirited\u201d gossip, as Furness has called it. Page Six reported that the divorce was \u201ca long time coming,\u201d while Jackman and Furness essentially said they had been growing apart. That\u2019s often the case with longtime couples, with \u2014 divorce after the age of 50 \u2014 a growing trend in the United States. \u201cWe have been blessed to share almost three decades together as husband and wife in a wonderful, loving marriage,\u201d the couple said in a statement said. \u201cOur journey now is shifting and we have decided to separate to pursue our individual growth.\u201d The Australian couple, who have long lived in New York City, are divorcing as their youngest child turns 18, which also is common in so-called gray divorces, Together, they share a son, Oscar, 23, and daughter, Ava, 18. Us Weekly furthermore hinted that Jackman\u2019s revelations could have to do with his \u201cunresolved childhood trauma.\u201d In December 2022, the Tony winner confessed to being in therapy to help him cope with his mother, Grace McNeil, leaving him when he was just 8 years old, Jackman was born in Sydney to English parents who had immigrated to Australia in 1967. When Jackman was 8, his parents divorced and his mother returned to England with his two sisters, while he stayed in Australia with his father and two brothers. \u201cI just started (therapy) recently,\u201d Jackman told Who magazine. \u201cIt helped me a lot. We all need a village.\u201d Jackman previously said that it had taken him years to come to terms with the idea that McNeil wouldn\u2019t be coming back for him. \u201cIt was traumatic,\u201d he told Who magazine in 2018, Today said. \u201cI thought she was probably going to come back. And then it sort of dragged on and on.\u201d Despite any feelings of abandonment experienced, Jackman also has said that his relationship with her is \u201cvery good.\u201d That\u2019s what he told \u201c60 Minutes Australia\u201d in 2012, when he said, \u201cI\u2019m not someone who\u2019s wallowed a lot in my family past. I don\u2019t feel like a victim \u2026 I feel very blessed actually in many ways.\u201d",

    "content": "SAN FRANCISCO (KGO) -- While Fleet Week has been going on for several days in San Francisco, some of the most anticipated events kick off on Friday. If you were in the city Thursday, you probably heard the loud sounds of the United States Navy Blue Angels. The group, made up of Navy and Marine Corps pilots, were practicing before three upcoming shows on Friday, Saturday and Sunday. But before they hit the skies, a Parade of Ships will take over the Bay. San Francisco Fleet Week 2023 schedule of events A fleet of ships will come under the Golden Gate Bridge and into the Bay starting at 11 a.m. on Friday. SF Fleet Week hosts the largest Parade of Ships on the West Coast, according to its website. San Francisco Fire Department boats will lead an escort of the Fleet while shooting jets of water into the air. You'll be able to see the Parade of Ships from anywhere from the Golden Gate Bridge to the Bay Bridge and along the San Francisco waterfront. A reviewing stand will be at the Marina Green. The parade is set to last an hour until 12 p.m. VIDEO: Meet 2 of the Blue Angel pilots flying over San Francisco during Fleet Week Fat Albert of the Blue Angels flies at 3 p.m. each day and when you see him, just know Blue Angels Super Hornet planes 1 through 6 are close behind. \"They go up and you can't hear them and you can't hear them until they get right above you, and then just as fast as they come they're gone,\" said Andrew Beard who works on a fishing boat named Lovely Martha. In terms of where to watch come actual show time, land is the cheapest option and Alcatraz tour tickets could put you on the island for $53. VIDEO: Here's what the 'super cool' Navy ship tours at San Francisco Fleet Week have to offer On Thursday for the Blue Angels' practice, some watched the Angels practice session from Alcatraz, others took to the docks of Fisherman's Wharf, and many watched in the shadows of the Golden Gate Bridge at the Marina Green. Many have opted to cruise with Captain Mike Rescino on his boat, the Lovely Martha for around $80 a person. \"There's still a couple boats with availability, but we've actually been sold out for this trip since March,\" said Rescino. If you do plan on coming to San Francisco for Fleet Week, you'll want to get to the city early because parking can be a challenge, especially in the Marina Green where there is only neighborhood parking.

    "content": "By Maria Loreto - New York October 06, 2023 12:35 PM EDT Gerard Pique can\u2019t escape Shakira . The Spanish soccer player appeared in an interview with El Escorpion Dorado , with the two driving around in a car and discussing Pique\u2019s career and accomplishments. As they drove, they decided to play some music, which invariably resulted in some Shakira hints. RELATED: Shakira is helped by handsome surf instructor after falling off surfboard: See pics Shakira and Piqu\u00e9 will reportedly sell their Barcelona properties View this post on Instagram A post shared by Escorpio\u0301n Dorado (@goldenescorpion) El Escorpion Dorado began the exchange by asking Pique about a song or an artist to play in the car. Pique requested Peso Pluma , saying that he\u2019s become incredibly popular. \u201cPlay the one of Peso Pluma and Bizarrap ,\u201d requested Pique. \u201cDo you want another Bizarrap song or should we just leave it at that?\u201d asked el Escorpion Dorado, laughing. \u201cLet\u2019s just leave it at that,\u201d said Pique. The interview went viral, with many viewers criticizing the host since he didn\u2019t pressure Pique for more. El Escorpion spoke about viewer reception on an interview, explaining that he and Pique were having good rapport, and he didn\u2019t want to get involved in a topic that\u2019s been so heavily discussed. \u201cWell, you don\u2019t ask about what\u2019s obvious. It\u2019s a topic that has been discussed a lot. The only person that has talked about it is Shakira. Pique hasn\u2019t said much. On my behalf, when there\u2019s kids involved I try to steer clear. Still, there were a couple of winks to Shakira over the course of the interview,\u201d he said. \u00a9Escorpion Dorado A look at the comments section of Escorpion Dorado\u2019s post Shakira at the Billboard Latin Music Awards For her part, Shakira is busier than ever. This past week, she\u2019s been readying the Billboard Latin Music Awards, which took place yesterday evening. In a panel conducted earlier this week, Shakira discussed her productivity and shared that making music has long been a form of therapy for her, and something that she turns to when she needs it most. \u201cIn composition, writing has always played a therapeutic role. I write the most when I\u2019m at my worst. Life gives me a blow, and from this, I have learned a lot and I feel stronger,\u201d she said in the panel, per Harper\u2019s Bazaar . \u201cMy music has been my main survival tool.\u201d Related Video: Taylor Swift's new romance with athlete Travis Kelce Loading the player...

    "description": "Amazon's Prime Day is bringing massive deals to wearables. If you're looking to buy a smartwatch or fitness tracker, look here for the best offers.",
    "content": "Smartwatches and fitness trackers are ubiquitous in 2023, and they can provide utility or even save your life. But they are expensive, with the best smartwatches costing hundreds of dollars or more. That's in addition to what you've already paid for a smartphone, so wearables can be a hard sell if you're not sure how useful they will be. For that reason, the best time to buy a smartwatch or fitness tracker is when there are great deals you can take advantage of. Amazon is holding a sales event called Prime Big Deal Days, and it's a preview of what's to come during and . While we don't know a lot about it just yet, we do know it'll be a great time to buy a new wearable. Early Prime Big Deal Days wearable deals Google just announced the new Pixel Watch 2, but the last-gen model is seeing massive discounts. You can get it for just $280 now at either Amazon or Best Buy. There's even a chance that it experiences an even bigger discount when Prime Big Deal Days officially start. Samsung's Galaxy Watch 5 Pro isn't the newest smartwatch the company has to offer, but it's still great in 2023. You can get it at a sweet $50 discount ahead of the Prime Big Deal Days sales event. Apple just debuted the Apple Watch Series 9 last month, but you can already get it at a discount. This is the lowest price we've seen on Amazon for the Series 9 yet. If you're looking to upgrade to a new Apple Watch, now is the time. What we're expecting from Prime Big Deal Days All the major smartwatch brands have released new models since the last Prime Day. There's the , , and the , among others. That means that we should see some significant discounts to last-generation models of those product lines. If you don't need the newest features, grabbing an older model could save you hundreds on Prime Big Deal Days. Since many of the new releases are only minor refinements of their prior generations, Prime Big Deal Days is a great time to upgrade to a last-gen wearable at a sweet discount. What we know about Amazon's upcoming sales event Amazon announced last month that it will be holding a new sales event named Prime Big Deal Days, which will span from October 10 through October 11. This isn't the first time that Amazon has offered a sales event in October. Last year, it gave Amazon Prime members \"early access\" to discounts coming for Black Friday and Cyber Monday with the Prime Early Access Sale. While the Prime Early Access Sale isn't returning this year, we expect the Prime Big Deal Days sale to follow a similar format to last year's event. That means thousands of products in many categories should experience significant discounts during Prime Big Deal Days. When and where will Prime Big Deal Days be held? Prime Big Deal Days will take between October 10 and October 11, but you can get early access to deals starting now. Amazon said that buyers in 19 different countries can participate in the sale: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, the U.S., and the UK. Do you need to be a Prime member to save on Prime Big Deal Days? Prime Big Deal Days will be exclusive to Prime members, like Amazon's other sales events, including Amazon Prime Day. You can participate without paying for a membership by starting a 30-day free trial before Prime Big Deal Days begin. This offer is only available to new subscribers, so if you've already subscribed to Amazon Prime before, you'll need to pay an annual fee of $139 or a monthly fee of $15. If you start your free trial now, you'll get access to Prime Big Deal Days for free. Prime Big Deal Days vs. Prime Day: What\u2019s the difference? Prime Big Deal Days is a preview of sales to come during Black Friday and Cyber Monday, so it's a secondary sales event for Amazon. The company typically offers more discounts and deals during its main Amazon Prime Day sale in July, which lasts 48 hours. However, even though there won't be as many deals this time around, the discounts are just as massive. You won't want to miss it, because wearables often see their lowest prices ever during Amazon sales events. Will there be a second Prime Day in 2023? Although the retailer has confirmed that Prime Big Deal Days will take place in October, it isn't officially a second Prime Day. Instead, Amazon's fall sales events are typically previews of what's to come during Black Friday and Cyber Monday festivities. The company's Prime Day was held from July 12 to July 13, 2023. However, if you're looking for a second Prime Day, your best bet will be to take advantage of Prime Big Deal Days. FAQ This largely depends on what you plan to use your smartwatch or fitness tracker for. If you're just trying to track your steps and receive notifications on your wrist, you probably don't need to spend more than a few hundred dollars for that functionality. However, if you need a wearable to step up your training or get in shape, you might want to spend more for these advanced features. Unless you are an athlete who knows exactly how a wearable will improve your workouts, you shouldn't spend more than $400-$600 on your new device. If you're an iPhone user, the best experience will be had when purchasing an Apple Watch. Garmin wearables will work with iOS, but the integration isn't as good as using an Apple Watch. However, Android users have a lot more options. The Google Pixel Watch will work great with any Android phone, and the Samsung Galaxy Watch has integration with Samsung smartphones.",

    "description": "Eggs and potatoes form a classic combo in many breakfast dishes. You've probably never tried cooking your eggs in a baked potato, but you totally should.",
    "content": "There aren't many foods out there quite as versatile as . From cheese and sour cream to chili and salsa, they're a prime vessel for toppings of all types; their starchy, mild flavor allows them to serve as a neutral base for countless concoctions. Eggs are a similar sort of food \u2014 a platform for ingredients of many kinds. Various omelet styles abound, as well as everything you could possibly put into a scramble, fold into a quiche, or add to a frittata. If you've never combined the power of baked potatoes and eggs, you're missing out on something delicious. Eggs and potatoes go together beautifully \u2014 there's a reason why there are so many varieties of breakfast potatoes. And, the shape of a scooped-out baked potato half is the perfect cradle for cooking a nice, oven-baked runny egg. The drippy, fatty egg yolk serves as a decadent topping for a fluffy baked potato interior. Eggs naturally go well with many of the traditional baked potato toppings, such as cheese and bacon. It's a pairing that just makes sense. Eggs are particularly good when paired with twice-baked potatoes as opposed to their singular-baked counterparts. are the upscaled, slightly more decadent version of a baked potato and they involve an extra step or two to really pack in the flavor. Rather than simply baking the potato in the oven, fluffing up the insides, topping it with your preferred ingredients, and calling it a day, twice-baked potatoes require you to scoop out the interior of the potato fully. That fluff then gets mixed with a variety of ingredients \u2014 typically ingredients you might find in a mashed potato recipe \u2014 until it's a paste. It's then filled back into the potato skin and baked a second time until the cheese gets melty and everything melds in the heat of the oven. When the potato goes back into the oven, you can press a little divot into the paste and crack an egg into it. The egg will set during the short extra time in the oven. This dish is sometimes called an \"Idaho Sunrise,\" and if you'd prefer to get a little different, frying or poaching an egg separately and topping the potato with it after the fact always works. If you're on a creative kick with your morning eggs, baked potatoes are only the beginning of the list of unique ways you can cook an egg in an edible vessel. , or egg cooked in bread with a circular cutout, is a classic. Avocado egg boats are a popular and fun way to eat eggs without the carbs of potatoes or bread. Pitted avocados come with a natural, egg-shaped hole in the center that can cradle a cracked egg for a short stint in the oven. You can enjoy this as a creamy and rich breakfast treat with a little sprinkling of seasoning and herbs on top. Prefer something a little lower in calorie count? Bell pepper halves also work perfectly as egg cups, and they're as colorful as they are delicious. Add a touch of cheese if you're looking for a pop of additional flavor.",

Speaking to Variety , Gilligan said this idea is \"doubtful as hell.\" Gilligan said he enjoyed working with RJ Mitte, who played Walt Jr., but making him follow in the footsteps of his father would be \"depressing as hell.\" \"That would be the wrong lesson from the show, if there are any lessons at all to be gleaned from it,\" Gilligan said. Also in the interview, Gilligan said he finds himself from time to time thinking about Breaking Bad's characters and what they're doing in the world now that the show has ended. He said Walt. Jr. and Skyler (Anna Gunn) are great people playing great roles and he wants to believe they found some happy ending after the events of Breaking Bad. \"When Breaking Bad ends, it's not a very happy ending for those characters at all, but it is presented that their lives go on. I'd like to believe things get better for them,\" he said. \"I'd hate the thought of Walt Jr. following in Walt's footsteps in the crime business.\" Gilligan said he expects someone to pitch a show about Walt Jr. in the next 10-15 years, with the story of Walt Jr. becoming the next Albuquerque crime boss and \"succeeding where his father failed.\" But Gilligan wants nothing to do with this. \"I could pretty much guarantee right now that I have no interest in seeing that happen. That'd be a sad tribute to the show,\" he said. \"It's fun thinking about what would happen to the characters, but it doesn't rise to the level of, 'Gee, I'd like to tell more about the story.' But who knows, in a few years maybe.\" Gilligan is finished with the Breaking Bad universe for now, following his work on that show, Better Call Saul, and the Netflix movie El Camino. Now, he's making a sci-fi series for Apple TV+ starring Rhea Seehorn.",

    "content": "Flexible working used to be taboo in many American workplaces \u2013 a modular, bespoke arrangement that was viewed by many as simply working less, rather than working better or more flexibly. More often than not, it was considered a perk or purely the realm of women and mothers. Nobody ever got to CEO by asking HR for more flexibility, right? And yet, one pandemic later, flexibility is not such an F-word after all. According to the most recent , not only do U.S. workers want the option of flexible working, they\u2019re not afraid to ask for more of it. And in the post-Covid landscape, when people have the chance to work flexibly, 87% of them take it. Prior McKinsey research had already shown that for those that left their jobs at the start of the pandemic, However, not everyone on the workforce spectrum is as enthusiastic about flexible working. Employers are apparently getting less and less tolerant of elastic working practices, the further we get from the Covid era. A survey of more than 1,806 US workers conducted by Monster in January 2023 showed that while half of employers believe giving their people flexible schedules has worked well, a third of firms who had planned to adopt a virtual or hybrid model had from a year ago. Experts believe this is a mistake. The work-life balance benefits that come with flexible working are undisputed, while it has been proven again and again that . Still, employee resistance abounds and key talent who find that their flexibility needs are no longer being met are either moving on, or practicing the not-so-subtle art of coffee badging: showing up at the office just long enough to grab a coffee and have a minimum of interactions before heading home again. If you intend to negotiate flexible working in a current or new contract, there are a few key things worth doing. First, schedule face-to-face time with management to discuss it. Come armed with a proposal that outlines exactly how you plan to communicate with the office, how you will still reach all of your required targets, and be honest about your needs and the reason behind them. \u2019 \u2013 being clear about defining your tasks and how you\u2019ll be assessed under a flexible model. Finally, if you score your ideal flexibility scenario, share as much information as you can with co-workers about what your new working week looks like and keep communication lines open. But don\u2019t let any old-fashioned stigmas get you down \u2013 just because you have flexible hours does not mean you\u2019re any less dedicated than your colleagues.

    "content": "By Shirley G\u00f3mez - New York October 06, 2023 12:02 PM EDT Jamie Spears , the estranged father of pop icon Britney Spears , is battling a severe health issue in the hospital. According to exclusive information obtained by Page Six , Jamie has been struggling with a severe infection that has necessitated surgical intervention, leading to his hospitalization in a specialized infectious disease facility. With his health condition described as \u201cseverely ill\u201d by sources close to the family, concerns for Jamie\u2019s well-being are rising. In recent months, there has been growing concern over Jamie Spears\u2018 health. TMZ first reported in August that he had been hospitalized \u201cseveral months ago\u201d due to complications from a knee replacement surgery he had undergone in the mid-2000s. \u00a9GettyImages While the details surrounding the nature of these complications remain undisclosed, the recent revelation of a severe infection requiring surgery suggests that Jamie\u2019s health issues have taken a more serious turn. Celebrity health Sharon and Kelly Osbourne open up about weight loss and Ozempic Alex Rodriguez thanks girlfriend Jaclyn Cordeiro for \u2018life-changing\u2019 30+ pound weight loss Sophia Loren sustained significant injuries after falling in her home Amidst Jamie Spears\u2018 ongoing health battle, there have been rumors circulating, particularly a report by the Daily Mail claiming that he had entered rehab for his struggles with alcohol over the summer. However, an insider source has refuted this claim, stating that the rehab reports are false. Jamie\u2019s lawyer has not commented on his health condition or addressed the rumors surrounding his rehabilitation. In 2021, Jamie Spears was suspended as the conservator of Britney\u2019s estate , immediately removing him from the conservatorship altogether. At the request of Britney and her legal team, Judge Brenda Penny agreed it was time to remove the controversial patriarch in front of a packed hearing in Los Angeles Superior Court.

The This has up to 24-hour wear and even extends your lashes to +36% length and 10X the volume! There\u2019s a hybrid fiber technology involved, which mixes different fibers and sizes up to 3mm to bring your lashes to their best potential, along with an extended helix brush to ensure the mascara reaches root to tip. Whenever you apply, you\u2019ll be asked if you\u2019re wearing falsies, since the mascara extends and voluminizes your lashes so well. It\u2019s clump-resistant and you won\u2019t have to worry about smudges, flakes, and smears \u2014 it\u2019s that good! Derrek also shared some tips while using as well. \u201cWipe excess mascara off the wand with a tissue, and then sweep the wand through the bottom lashes first; if you do them last, you\u2019ll smudge. Let it dry, and then apply a second coat,\u201d he said. Many reviewers are raving about the mascara as well. \u201cI am thrilled to have found this mascara. It does everything it is supposed to do\u2013great length and color, no clumping\u2013 for a fraction of the price of other mascaras. I did not experience any smudging or flaking after a hot day.

Manchester United 0-1 Arsenal (Blackstenius, 14) All her own work once Russo and Catley had sent the Swedish striker away. She cuts in, checks and scores. Jonas really enjoyed that one on the sidelines. 4m ago 14.43 EDT 12 min: An unfortunate slip means Arsenal concede a corner, Geyse pushing up, and D\u2019Angelo unable to keep it in. United win another as Toone pings in her effort. 5m ago 14.42 EDT 11 min: This is a tight affair. United\u2019s defence is organised, Arsenal pushing hard but not yet finding the final pass. 8m ago 14.40 EDT 8 min: United are looking to the long ball to pick off the Arsenal press, with the likes of Katie Zelem good passers of the ball. Up the other end, there\u2019s an echoey boo as Russo gets on the ball. She\u2019s been quiet so far. 11m ago 14.37 EDT 6 min: Two Spaniards in United\u2019s Garcia and Arsenal\u2019s get in a tangle but it\u2019s all smiles once the ball goes dead. 12m ago 14.36 EDT 5 min: Early Arsenal chance, Maritz pumping the ball into the middle but their forwards miss their cue. The first United chance follows quickly, Toone sending Garcia away, only for the cross to nestle in D\u2019Angelo\u2019s hands. 14m ago 14.34 EDT 3 min: Quite a long time taken over an Arsenal throw, which may be a result of the unfamiliarity of their team. Same back three as last week, so some continuity. 16m ago 14.32 EDT 1 min: And away we go. United begin calmly amid the raucous scenes, Arsenal looking to press high. 18m ago 14.29 EDT Pretty rowdy at Leigh Sports Village, the home fans fancy another win over Arsenal. 21m ago 14.26 EDT Charles Antaki gets in contact on Arsenal . He\u2019s worried: \u201cI think Arsenal fans know that lose this one, and the terrible start to the season (out of the Champions League before it properly starts; loss at home in the WSL in the first game) continues, and the clouds not only gather, but clump together, take a deep breath, and rain all over pretty well the entire season\u2019s parade. No wonder Eidevall has made six changes. But the worry is that apart from Kim Little, there\u2019s no top-level, consistent quality in the side, and the Miedema/Williamson/Mead cavalry is still somewhere over a far distant hill\u2026\u201d 25m ago 14.22 EDT The big news is that Jonas Eidevall has made six changes from last week, that\u2019s a lot and in the prelims he\u2019s said that \u201cno place is guaranteed\u201d. The big absence is Katie McCabe. Marc Skinner, meanwhile, has made no changes from last week while Sabrina D\u2019Angelo, Noelle Maritz, Victoria Pelova, Laia Codina, Amanda Ilestedt and Stina Blackstenius are IN. And Maneula Zinsberger, Lotte Wubben-Moy, Close Lacasse, Katie McCabe, Frida Maanum and Caitlin Foord are OUT. That includes a change of goalie \u2013 D\u2019Angelo for Zinsberger. These teams met twice last season, and Manchester United won both matches, Russo scoring the winner in their home match. 1h ago 13.33 EDT Here's the teams Russo starts against her old team\u2026. \ud83d\udea8 Presenting our first home #WSL line-up of 2023/24! \ud83d\udd34 Let's go, Reds! \ud83d\udcaa #MUWomen \u2014 Manchester United Women (@ManUtdWomen) October 6, 2023 Manchester United: Earps, Blundell, Le Tissier, Turner, George, Ladd, Zelem, Garcia, Toone, Galton, Geyse.

While the visitors will turn out in a new, Stella McCartney-designed bespoke away shirt for Friday\u2019s match, United have their own visual cue to represent their off-field progress. A mural of Mary Earps, created by the club with Sky Sports and daubed with the words \u201cWelcome to Manchester\u201d, sends a defiant message after the England keeper stayed at United this summer, amid persistent interest from Arsenal. Jonas Eidevall earns Arsenal contract but needs WSL wins quickly Read more 1h ago 13.30 EDT Preamble It\u2019s a big night for Alessia Russo, the Lioness who left Manchester United to join Arsenal. The pressure\u2019s immediately on for Arsenal, after losing last week to Liverpool, a blow to follow their premature Champions League exit. This was supposed to be the season that they put down a big title challenge and, judging from recent WSL seasons, the margin for error is not large so an away win is high on Jonas Eidevall\u2019s wishlist. For Manchester United\u2019s Marc Skinner, an away win at Aston Villa was a handy start over a decent side, with Rachel Williams scoring in injury time to win it. Lucia Garcia\u2019s goal was a good sign for a team hoping to replace Russo from within. Kick-off at 7.30pm, join me.

    "content": "ANTIOCH \u2014 A motorcyclist stopped for a red light was fatally injured Thursday when police said he was hit from behind by a speeding vehicle. He was identified by the coroner\u2019s office on Friday as William Marlik Jr., 63, of Bay Point. The fatal collision happened about 2:08 p.m. Thursday at the intersection of Deer Valley Road and Prewett Ranch Drive. Authorities said Marlik was stopped at a red signal light when he was struck by a speeding vehicle, causing him to be ejected. Police did not say which street Marlik actually was on or what kind of vehicle hit him. He was taken to a hospital, where he later died. The force of the crash caused both the motorcycle and the other vehicle to collide with two other vehicles at the intersection, police said. Authorities said police officers were nearby on an unrelated matter and immediately rushed to the scene and began rendering first aid to all involved. Police did not say exactly how many people that was or what the extent of their injuries were. The driver of the vehicle that caused the collision remained on scene and was cooperating with traffic investigators. Police said speed and inattention appear to be the cause of the collision, but they did not announce an arrest in the incident. Anyone with information about the collision is asked to call the police non-emergency number at or email traffic investigator Frederick Blumberg at .

If there\u2019s \u201ca vaxx\u201d war between the two NFL stars, Rodgers started it during his regular Tuesday appearance on the \u201cThe Pat McAfee Show.\u201d Rodgers made his \u201cMr. Pfizer\u201d wisecrack two days after his New York Jets lost to Kelce\u2019s Chiefs 23-20 on Sunday. Rodgers, a four-time MVP, didn\u2019t play because he suffered an achilles tendon injury in the first game of the season. When McAfee asked Rodgers to assess the Jets\u2019 play, the Chico-reared quarterback commended the Jets\u2019 defense, suggesting that his teammates managed to keep Kelce from scoring any touchdowns. \u201cMr. Pfizer, we kinda shut him down,\u201d Rodgers said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t have a crazy impact game. Obviously he had some yards and stuff. It felt like for the most part we played.\u201d The \u201cMr. Pfizer\u201d comment prompted McAfee and his co-host A.J. Hawk to laugh uneasily. Rodgers and McAfee then spent the next few minutes riffing on a joke Rodgers once made, which prompted a false report that he suffered \u201cCOVID toe\u201d during his 2021 bout with the virus. McAfee asked Rodgers if it felt good for him to throw some shade at Kelce for his Pfizer endorsement. He also asked Rodgers whether his \u201cMr. Pfizer\u201d quip was planned. Rodgers deflected by saying he\u2019s known Kelce a long time and can\u2019t see how he would be bothered by his joke. \u201cNo, he\u2019s doing commercials for Pfizer, so I\u2019m sure he\u2019s owning it,\u201d Rodgers said. But Hawk pointed out that Kelce also endorses a number of other products and wondered why Rodgers didn\u2019t call him, for example, \u201cMr. Lowe\u2019s.\u201d On Friday, Kelce shrugged off Rodgers\u2019 \u201cMr Pfizer\u201d remark, while explaining his position on the COVID shot. \u201cI mean, I\u2019ve always been, you know \u2014 once I got the vaccine, I mean \u2014 I got it before of keeping myself safe, keeping my family safe, the people in this building,\u201d Kelce said. \u201cSo, yeah, I stand by it. 1,000 percent. And fully comfortable with him calling me Mr. Pfizer.\u201d Even as Rodgers and Kelce tried to laugh off the \u201cMr. Pfizer\u201d comment, it still takes on darker connotations when viewed in the context of attacks that Kelce and his rumored girlfriend Taylor Swift have endured in the past few months. The attacks, from vaccine skeptics, include recycled conspiracy theories about COVID-19 shots, AFP reported, via Yahoo News. Some of the internet\u2019s \u201cmost notorious anti-vaxxers,\u201d such as Charlie Kirk, founder of conservative organization Turning Point USA, also have been exploiting the \u201cbuzz\u201d around Kelce and Swift\u2019s rumored romance in order to crack jokes, lob insults and push false claims that vaccines cause widespread heart problems or kill people. It would seem that Rodgers would be particularly attuned to the heated rhetoric used by \u201cnotorious anti-vaxxers,\u201d since he\u2019s a well-known vaccine skeptic himself. Back in November 2021, the former Green Bay Packers star infamously tested positive for the coronavirus and revealed on \u201cThe Pat McAfee Show\u201d that he had not gotten the vaccine. During that incendiary appearance, Rodgers was accused of spreading common anti-vaccine disinformation when he launched into an angry screed to justify why he had not gotten the vaccine.",

    "content": "California startup Pacific Adventure Works is about to make it much easier to sleep in your vehicle, without the expense and bulk of an all-out RV build. The company puts a unique spin on the \"bedroll\" with a portable sleeper platform that rolls up slim for travel and quickly builds into a fully adjustable bed that turns your beat-up Toyota 4Runner or Subaru Outback into the ultimate oceanfront or mountaintop abode. It's designed to work with all kinds of different hatchback vehicles and set up in minutes, giving adventurers the full freedom and flexibility the wide-open road and wilderness demand. While a ground tent gets you closer to nature than any camper van or motorhome, all it takes is one night of foul, windy weather to get you questioning why you're spending the night in a light aluminum-boned hunk of sail fabric and not in the fully enclosed multi-ton car or SUV parked just steps away. While many SUVs and station wagon offer the space to do exactly that, a trunk filled with camping gear, sports equipment and luggage you can't simply toss out into exposed weather can make the idea a nonstarter. And rear seats don't always fold perfectly flat, leaving something to be desired in terms of lying comfort. We've seen no shortage of meant to create a more comfortable, level vehicle camping experience inside factory cars and SUVs, but these tend to be heavy and inflexible, requiring precise mounting locations in the vehicle and quite possibly eating up valuable space you'd rather use to transport something else. Each one also tends to be designed for a specific model or subset of vehicles and won't work with just any ol' wagon. Pacific Adventure Works has made it a mission to offer a lighter, simpler, more flexible solution for turning a basic station wagon, SUV or crossover into a cozy overnight shelter. Borrowing a little inspiration from the folding roll-top camping table, it's designed a two-part raised sleeper platform to work with a large vehicle set. Called the Hideaway Sleeping Platform (HSP), Pacific's design rides as a roundish 40- or 48-in-long (102- or 122-cm) package, depending on bed size, with a diameter of just 8 inches (20 cm). All the individual frame members and connectors store inside the ribbed nylon topper, rolling into a package that you can slide into the cargo area. When it's time to camp, the HSP's aluminum beams build up into a full frame with help from polypropylene hubs, no tools required, supporting the fabric-covered platform that rolls out on top. From there, you can drop on a foam or inflatable mattress and enjoy a homestyle bed inside four solid automotive walls. The Hideaway platform supports up to 400 lb (181 kg). At 30 to 35 lb (13.6 to 15.9 kg) for the full kit, the HSP is plenty manageable for one person. Its legs adjust in height to even out uneven vehicle floors and offer between 9.5 and 15.5 inches (24 to 39 cm) of under-bed storage space \u2013 so you don't have to dump all your cargo outside. It won't clear a larger cooler or fridge/freezer, but it can top storage boxes, boxes, an vacuum-insulated hard cooler, soft coolers, loose stoves and gear, etc. Users can adjust the height for the best combination of headroom and under-bed storage space. Just as importantly, the Hideaway's telescoping frame slide-adjusts in total length, up to 72 in (183 cm), to fit the vehicle snugly. It even shortens to roughly half-length to create a platform that fits over the load area behind the rear seats, where it can work as a shelf for storing a second level of gear or just a privacy cover to hide any valuables in the trunk. Pacific Adventure Works plans to launch preorders this month, with deliveries to begin in December. It will offer the kit as a 30-in-wide (76-cm) Solo platform for $599, a 40-in-wide (102-cm) Double for $699 and a 48-in-wide (122-cm) XL for $799. It plans to build the kits in the US and prides itself on \"buy-it-for-life\" construction. The modular nature of the design also means that it will be easy enough to replace any parts that do break along the journey. Source:",

    "description": "The custody battle between the Tesla CEO and the singer is heating up, with a report on how he filed suit first to establish control over their three young children.",
    "content": "The custody battle between Elon Musk and Grimes is heating up with a report that the Tesla CEO actually filed suit first to establish parental rights over their three young children, claiming that he has had \u201cactual care, control, and possession of each child\u201d since their birth. Last month, Musk secretly filed a petition in Texas to establish parental rights over the children, ages 3 and 1, before Grimes, whose birth name is Claire Boucher, decided to sue the tech mogul herself in San Francisco this week, according to and . In his petition, filed Sept. 7, Musk accused Grimes, his sometimes girlfriend, of moving California to escape the jurisdiction of Texas courts, Insider reported. He said Grimes lived with him and their three children in Texas from May to July this year, Insider said. But after Musk served Grimes on Sept. 13, she turned around and sued him in San Francisco Superior Court on Sept. 29. In , Grimes has asked for physical custody of the children and includes a \u201cstandard restraining order,\u201d which would prevent the children from being moved out of California by either parent. These dueling lawsuits mark the latest conflict over the children between Musk and Grimes, a couple who were in an on-again, off-again relationship starting in 2018, Insider said. Musk and Grimes first became parents together in May 2020 when she gave birth to their son, X \u00c6 A-Xii, otherwise known as X. In late 2021, Grimes revealed that they also became parents of a daughter, Exa Dark Sider\u00e6l, who was born via surrogate. More recently, the couple confirmed they also had a son together, Techno Mechanicus, nicknamed Tau, who also was born via surrogate. Although the couple reportedly first broke up in 2022, they appeared to maintain a cordial relationship, Insider said. Grimes even continued to live with Musk in Austin for a period after they broke up. Still, Grimes revealed that she had problems with some of Musk\u2019s parenting choices. She told Vanity Fair that she preferred to keep their children out of the public eye and expressed dismay when Musk began to bring their oldest child, X, to public events. \u201cI mean, I think E is really seeing him as a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and bringing him to everything and stuff,\u201d Grimes told Vanity Fair. The first sign that their relationship had turned hostile came last month when Grimes shared a since-deleted post on X, her ex-boyfriend\u2019s platform, in which she alleged that he wasn\u2019t allowing her to see one of their children, possibly X. She also threatened to take the billionaire to court unless he let her see her son or responded to her lawyer. She said the situation was \u201cutterly ripping my family apart.\u201d In Grimes\u2019 , the singer is also seeking to \u201cestablish parental relationship.\u201d Los Angeles-based family law attorney Christopher Melcher said this request is routine in cases when couples are not not married and is usually filed alongside demands for child support and custody rights. TMZ said it appears that Grimes is setting up a situation to have a judge establish custody rights and child support. Unless there is a finding that Grimes is an unfit parent, she would almost certainly have some custodial rights, TMZ said. In fact, judges usually award both parents joint custody. In Musk\u2019s court filings, he said believed the custody dispute would settle, but wanted Texas courts to weigh in if it didn\u2019t, Insider said. If Grimes has been complaining about Musk being inflexible when it comes to parenting, many would say she could have informed herself better before she chose to have three children with him. For starts, the tech mogul has 11 children with three different women and has expressed the belief that declining birth rates are a threat to human civilization and that \u201csmart people\u201d like himself need to populate the earth with as many children as possible. Musk\u2019s first wife, Canadian novelist Justine Wilson, characterized him as a difficult, controlling and patriarchal. Musk and Wilson, who were married from 2000 to 2008, had six children together, the first of whom died at age 10 weeks of sudden infant death syndrome. Wilson said Musk grew up in the male-dominated culture of South Africa and has a \u201cwill to compete and dominate.\u201d More recently, Musk welcomed twins with his current partner Shivon Zitis. The twins were born shortly before Grimes and Musk welcomed their daughter Exa Dark Sider\u00e6l. According to the new biography of Musk by Water Isaacson, Grimes apparently only learned that Musk and Zilis had twins together at the same time as the rest of the public \u2014 even though Zilis gave birth while Grimes and Musk\u2019s surrogate was just down the hallway in the same maternity ward, Jezebel reported.",

    "content": "LAJAS BLANCAS, Panama (AP) \u2014 At the edge of Panama\u2019s Darien jungle Friday, Venezuelans made up the majority of migrants waiting for buses to speed them across the country to Costa Rica, where they planned to continue moving north. Annie Carrillo, a 38-year-old Venezuelan migrant traveling with her Colombian husband and another friend, said they had crossed the dense, lawless jungle from Colombia in three days after paying $350 each to a guide. When she heard about the U.S. government\u2019s plan to restart deportation flights to Venezuela in the coming days, Carrillo was discouraged. \u201cNo one emigrates from their country because they want to. One migrates because you have basic needs and there isn\u2019t support in your native country,\u201d she said, starting to cry. The U.S. government hopes the threat of deportation will be enough to make Venezuelans reconsider trying to enter the United States illegally and opt instead for the online appointment system to make asylum claims or other legal paths. But some migrants said Friday that it would not stop them from continuing their journey. Venezuela has suffered political, economic and humanitarian crises over the past decade, pushing at least 7.3 million people to migrate and making food and other necessities unaffordable for those who remain. The vast majority who fled settled in neighboring countries in Latin America, but many began coming to the United States in the last three years. Observers have pointed out that earlier this week the Biden administration justified the expansion of temporary protected status for Venezuelans announced last month by noting the severe humanitarian challenges in the country. But now the administration has decided Venezuela is not bad enough to keep them from deporting migrants back there. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security\u2019s assistant secretary for border and immigration policy said Friday that it is already repatriating people to countries with humanitarian situations similar to those in Venezuela. \u201cThese direct repatriations are obviously made now to Venezuela, but also to other countries that have complicated situations such as Haiti, Cuba and other countries around the world,\u201d Blas N\u00fa\u00f1ez-Neto told reporters. \u201cWhat we are announcing is in accordance with our laws, with our international obligations.\u201d The U.S. Border Patrol encountered Venezuelans 22,000 times along the southwest border in August, nearly double the number in July, but still slightly below the 25,000 encounters in August 2022. Although Venezuelans make up about 60% of the migrants crossing the Darien Gap this year, they trail migrant numbers from countries including Mexico, Honduras and Guatemala at the U.S. border. At least 18 migrants died and more were injured Friday when a bus carrying them crashed in the southern Mexican state of Oaxaca. N\u00fa\u00f1ez-Neto said that more than 130,000 Venezuelans had arrived to the U.S. in the past year through legal paths, such as CBP One and humanitarian parole. Still more than 2,500 miles (4,000 kilometers) from the nearest U.S. border crossing, Carrillo hadn\u2019t made up her mind yet about whether they would wait for an appointment to seek asylum or risk crossing and turning themselves over to U.S. border agents. She said they had heard it could take more than three months to get an appointment through CBP One, an eternity for migrants who usually spend all their money just making it to the border. \u201cWhat sense is there in making this journey where every second counts and every second you\u2019re putting your life at risk and only to arrive in a country and have them deport you just like that?\u201d Carrillo said. Patricia Andrade, one of the founders of the humanitarian assistance organization Venezuelan Roots in Miami, was incredulous about the possibility of mass deportations to Venezuela considering that thousands of migrants arrive every day at the southern border. \u201cHow many flights are they going to take?\u201d Andrade said. She said Venezuelans are fleeing their country out of desperation and will continue to come. \u201cThe announcement of deportations is not going to scare everyone,\u201d said Andrade, whose organization provides clothes, sheets, towels and pots to Venezuelan recent arrivals. \u201cAs long as the Venezuelan problem is not resolved, people will continue arriving.\u201d Back in Lajas Blancas, Panama, at the edge of the Darien jungle, Jhonny Zambrano, a 20-year-old Venezuelan, waited with his parents, sister and niece. He said the family did not have a plan yet for when they reach the U.S. border, but that if he was deported he would try again until he was successful. He had been a student in Venezuela, but the economic situation made it impossible for him to continue his studies, forcing him at times to go without eating at school. \u201cWhat am I going to do in our country?\u201d Zambrano asked. If deported, \u201cI would do it (migrate) again to work and to get my family ahead.\u201d ___ Salomon reported from Miami.",

    "content": "Augmented reality eyewear is great for providing turn-by-turn navigational cues, but a lot of the goggles and visors have a kind of \u2026 vibe. Blucap Moto sunglasses are different, in that they won't make you look like a Sheldon Cooper wannabe. As their name implies, the Blucap Motos are made for use by motorcycle riders. A version for cyclists is reportedly in the works. The very normal-looking sunglasses wirelessly communicate with a handlebar-mounted remote and an iOS/Android app on the user's smartphone \u2013 that phone can just be stuffed in a pocket or backpack. Once the user has selected their destination on the app, they just put on the glasses and hit the road. Whenever the user subsequently approaches an intersection where they have to turn, a tiny MicroLED display projects a directional arrow onto the inside of the right-hand lens. That arrow automatically disappears once the turn has been made. If the user wishes to see where they are within a street map, pushing a button on the remote temporarily brings up a monochrome map segment with their position indicated on it. It's also possible to have the app display incoming phone calls, text messages and speed limit alerts. The calls can be taken via a paired third-party Bluetooth headset. All of that having been said, the Motos are designed to be very simple and uncluttered. They feature no buttons or other physical controls, plus they power up and connect with the phone/remote as soon as their arms are opened. One charge of their integrated lithium battery is reportedly good for 10 hours of use, while the remote should run for about six months per pair of button cell batteries. The glasses feature a neutral set of permanent inner lenses, which can be combined with various interchangeable outer lens. They come with a set of polarized, scratch-resistant, anti-fog, tinted outer lenses which block 100% of UVA and UVB light. And yes, they can be ordered with prescription lenses. The Blucap Moto sunglasses are currently the subject of a , where a pledge of US$299 will get you a set \u2013 assuming they reach production. Their planned retail price is $399. They're demonstrated in the following video. Sources: ,",

    "content": "Cars are so technologically advanced and filled with so many features now, a time traveler from just 10-15 years ago would be wowed if they were to get into a current car on the market. The advent of EVs has seemed to accelerate things, with automakers using them as testbeds to showcase the latest and greatest technology. Things like over two feet of , enough systems for two vehicles, full entertainment systems and more seat adjustments than one person could ever need are commonplace now. But what if you\u2019re one of the people who don\u2019t have a need for or don\u2019t care for some of this stuff? While the tech is welcome, it\u2019s helping to drive up the cost of cars. And a lot of the tech that comes equipped in cars some may refuse to use. Hands free driving systems and smart cruise control for instance. I refuse to use them. Not for fear or anything\u2026well I guess you could say that. I don\u2019t trust them or think the technology is advanced enough to be using them yet. The fact that you have to keep your eyes forward and your hands near the wheel to take over tells us as much. And when you live in a place with as much traffic as Southern California, systems like that in stop and go traffic don\u2019t really make much sense to me. So now you know what car feature I refuse to use. Now it\u2019s your turn. What car features do you refuse to use? It can be anything, from as simple as heated seats to something like Ford\u2019s BlueCruise or GM\u2019s SuperCruise. Let us know in the comments.",

Johnson (who was previously in a long-term relationship with Foster), plus five other named women and one whose identity has been anonymized, have now filed a lawsuit against Foster, accusing him of a \u201cdisturbing pattern and practice of chilling and depraved behavior towards women,\u201d and suing him on charges of \u201cdomestic violence, sexual battery, assault, stalking, civil rights violations, gender violence, and the intentional infliction of emotional distress.\u201d In the suit, Johnson alleges that Foster, who she began dating in 2012, frequently abused drugs and alcohol, and, after their relationship ended earlier this year, attempted to extort her for $150,000. (He is also accused of using her home\u2019s security system to track her movements.) Her sister, Haylie Langseth, is also a plaintiff in the suit, saying Foster groped her in front of several people, and that she felt pressured not to report him because she feared he would retaliate against her sister. Foster worked for for several years, appearing on multiple specials from the -based web series; he also hosted several official talk shows centered on the franchise\u2019s content. He left in 2021, with the company, , expressing \u201cmad love and support\u201d for him; the lawsuit now alleges that he was actually fired, at least in part over his behavior on social media.

In addition to the accusations from Johnson and her sister, the lawsuit also includes accusations of verbal abuse and groping from several other women, including subordinates at , who state that Foster used his status as the company to gain access to women.

    "description": "Todd McFarlane reveals the new Batman & Robin figures for DC Multiverse",
    "content": "Todd McFarlane revealed some new additions to his hit DC Multiverse line of action figures at Toy Fair , including the entire line of figures from the infamous 1997 film Batman & Robin. McFarlane took a minute at Toy Fair to show off the new line, which includes Batman (George Clooney), Robin (Chris O'Donnell), Batgirl (Alicia Silverstone), and Poison Ivy (Uma Thurman) . There is one more character in the set, and that would be Mr. Freeze himself Arnold Schwarzenegger, who is the set's Build-A-Figure. Freeze's legs are with Batman, while the arms and some feeze effects are with Robin. The chest and torso come with Ivy, and the head, shoulders, and blaster are included with Batgirl. The likenesses overall are solid, with Batman and Freeze at the top overall. While the others don't look quite as close in likeness, they all boast great overall face sculpts. Each figure also comes with the usual trading card and figure base, but they don't seem to come with any individual accessories due to their inclusion of the Mr. Freeze figure. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Todd McFarlane (@toddmcfarlane) McFarlane doesn't reveal a release date for the figures, but odds are we will see them hitting stores relatively soon, as McFarlane shows them all in packaging already and even says these are production figures. It also remains to be seen if McFarlane will also create a Batman Forever series down the line, though that probably depends on if these sell well. At this point, you can almost get any major movie Batman in the Multiverse line, with Robert Pattinson, Ben Affleck, Christian Bale, and Michael Keaton all represented in some way or another. Val Kilmer is the only movie Batman who doesn't have a figure yet, and with the changed-up suit for Robin, Jim Carrey's Riddler, and Tommy Lee Jones's Two-Face, you could see getting a whole series based on that film. As for the Build-A-Figure, perhaps a Batman Forever-styled Batmobile would work. This is actually the perfect time for a new action figure line from the film, as it became a popular topic once more after Clooney made a surprise cameo as Bruce Wayne in this year's The Flash. The film has become infamous for its shift from the films that preceded it, but in a previous interview with Empire, Schwarzenegger said he doesn't regret making the film in the least . \"In most cases I don't regret the movies that failed or were not as good,\" Schwarzenegger said. \"It's always easy to be smug in hindsight, right?\" Schwarzenegger continued, saying, \"I don't regret it at all. I felt that the character was interesting and two movies before that one Joel Schumacher was at his height. So the decision-making process was not off. At the same time I was doing Eraser over there and Warner Bros. begged me to do the movie.\" In a previous interview with Entertainment Tonight, Thurman also had great things to say about the experience . \"That was a fantastic experience. I had to wear lots of rubber suits,\" Thurman said. \"I did not have a rubber mask. I had my own face. But I had some rubber appliances on my face sometimes. That was about as much rubber as I've ever worked with, personally.\" Are you excited for the new figures?

    "content": "BOULDER, Colo. \u2014 A judge ruled Friday that the man accused of killing 10 people at a Colorado supermarket in a 2021 rampage is mentally competent to stand trial. The decision allows the prosecution of Ahmad Al Aliwi Alissa to move forward. Judge Ingrid Bakke ruled that Alissa, who has schizophrenia, is able to understand court proceedings and contribute to his own defense. Bakke presided over a hearing last week to consider an August determination by experts at a state mental hospital that Alissa was competent after previous evaluations found otherwise. Alissa\u2019s defense attorney asked for the hearing to debate the finding. In her ruling, Bakke said she was convinced that, following forced medication, Alissa was more communicative and had a \u201cfar improved capacity to elucidate his reasoning and decision-making.\u201d That\u2019s a critical component of competency, which partly hinges on Alissa being able to make informed decisions in his own case, such as whether to testify himself. Alissa, 24, is charged with murder and multiple attempted murder counts after the shooting spree on March 22, 2021, in a crowded King Soopers Store in Boulder, about 30 miles (50 kilometers) northwest of Denver. Alissa has not yet been asked to enter a plea. Alissa allegedly began firing outside the grocery store, shooting at least one person in the parking lot before moving inside, employees told investigators. Employees and customers scrambled to escape the violence, some leaving loading docks in the back and others sheltering in nearby stores. A SWAT team took Alissa into custody. Authorities haven\u2019t yet disclosed a motive for the shooting. Alissa\u2019s mental condition improved this spring after he was forced under a court order to take medication to treat his schizophrenia, said a psychologist who testified for the prosecution last week. He was admitted to the state hospital in December 2021. Schizophrenia can shake someone\u2019s grasp on reality, potentially interfering in a legal defense in court. Mental competency does not mean he\u2019s been cured. Mental competency is also separate from pleading not guilty by reason of insanity, which is a claim that someone\u2019s mental health prevented them from understanding right from wrong when a crime was committed. Last year, the remodeled King Soopers reopened, with about half of those who worked there previously choosing to return.",

The EP\u2019s \u201c A WOMAN COMES INTO THE ROOM \u201d features a \u201870s poem by American poet Alice Notley. Giles says she initially discovered the poem through a track by acid house duo Medicine 8, but she wasn\u2019t able to find the record for 10 years. She recently unearthed it and decided she needed to do a \u201cdeep dive\u201d into it. While it was difficult to locate Medicine 8, she eventually found one of its artists. He dug into his old record collection and found that Notley was the poet on the song. Giles found Notley and got her permission to use her sample. Impressively, No Rules was entirely funded by selling digital collectibles on web3 and by raising Ethereum\u2014a truly innovative feat. The beatmaker, who is currently ranked No. 9 and was formerly rated No. 2 on the chart for top artists in web3, says she\u2019s been selling NFTs for almost two years. Giles believes that web3 won\u2019t be sustainable because many artists do not interact with the people buying their works, so she decided to \u201cflip the script.\u201d She did this by uploading her music to web3 the same way she would post her tracks on SoundCloud . In turn, she learned that there was an entire fan base on the technology side who would consistently buy her NFTs because they knew she was \u201cgoing to come back\u201d and release more. The multi-genre maestro connects daily with her NFT buyers through a telegram chat with about 150 people. This has allowed her to become close with her community and make friends with some of them. She even met bloody white and DEEGAN through mutual friends in the web3 space, and both artists are featured on the EP. Giles says they are \u201csmaller\u201d acts on NO RULES but there are also \u201clegends\u201d on it, such as Cakes Da Killa and Wreckno . Her web3 work has not only allowed her to make new connections but it has also proven to be profitable. Giles makes royalties on this secondary market, noting that it can be of big financial gain if one is consistent with it. She defines it as a \u201clong-term game.\u201d She has seen remarkable success through selling her NFTs as it has funded everything as far as marketing, recording feature costs, touring and more. The producer has the power to sell her NFTs and raise an abundance of Ethereum because she\u2019s been an independent artist throughout the majority of her career, giving her the rights to retail her catalog. \"I started [raving] so young. I was like 15,\" Mija says. \"When I went to my first rave, I was a full ... [+] kandi kid. Phoenix was wild. We had a big, big underground rave scene.\" Dylan Villarreal The heavyweight champion of genre-less music says the biggest advantages of being an independent artist are putting out music whenever and with whoever she wants, not having middlemen in her release process, not having people trying to guide where her art goes and not having her albums scrapped. Giles believes music makers should have autonomy over their own creativity. However, she does see the benefits of working with labels, which she does with smaller projects. An example of this is when she released \u201c Groove \u201d on LP Giobbi's Femme House imprint. The label provided her with a non-exclusive deal for the song, which was presented on the LP Giobbi x Insomniac Records Presents Femme House compilation . \u201cI want to collaborate with other artists, with other labels and [with] communities,\u201d Giles says. \u201cI want to be able to do that, but I don't ever want to do it exclusively. When you're able to do a non-exclusive, it's cool [because] we can work together in a few years if I want to remix this or do something.\u201d Giles believes that her purpose in life is to \u201cmake people feel good, make people feel seen and make them feel like they can express themselves without being judged.\u201d She tries to emulate this through her deejaying, noting that she feels in control of those spaces when performing. She adds that by giving off that energy in her sets, people reciprocate that vibe back and it fills the room. The genre-bending maven says her sound is less \u201ccurated or anticipated\u201d as it\u2019s based on different phases she has gone through in her life. Giles says it\u2019s cyclical and that each time she returns to a style, she has more knowledge from when she previously produced it. This allows her to become better at making those tunes by evolving her sound design. Her \u201cfk a genre\u201d concept began when she was 23 years old because she wanted to learn as much as possible. This ideology has certainly empowered her to transcend stylistic borders throughout her growth as an artist. \u201cWhat looks like I'm chaotic and doing all sorts of things at the same time\u2026I kind of am,\u201d Giles says. \u201cI feel like now, for the first time, I am actually honing in on my sound and figuring out what it sounds like instead of [making] a million random different things. It is starting to feel more cohesive. So I'm not sure if it's really intentional, but in the beginning, it was because I didn't know what I wanted to do yet and I wasn't sure where I stood.\u201d Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn .

    "description": "A website touts Shane Jenkins as the founder of a group that seeks to \"shed light on the January 6th defendants and the treatment they have faced from the government.\"",
    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 A Texas man who attacked the U.S. Capitol with a metal tomahawk \u2014 and is now the face of a website selling merchandise portraying jailed rioters as \u201cpolitical prisoners\u201d \u2014 was sentenced Friday to seven years behind bars. Shane Jenkins, 46, tried to smash a Capitol window with his tomahawk during the Jan. 6, 2021, siege. He also repeatedly threw makeshift weapons at police officers, hurling a desk drawer, a flagpole, a metal walking stick and a wooden pole with a spear-like point. A website touts Jenkins as the founder of a group that seeks to \u201cshed light on the January 6th defendants and the treatment they have faced from the government.\u201d The website sells T-shirts, hoodies, hats, tote bags and other merchandise with Jan. 6-themed slogans, including \u201cFree the J6 political prisoners\u201d and \u201cWant my vote? Help the J6ers.\u201d Another shirt for sale features former President Donald Trump\u2019s mugshot over the words \u201cIndicted we stand.\u201d The website also commemorates Jenkins\u2019 own role in the riot. It displays a cartoon avatar of Jenkins, nicknamed Skullet, and a logo depicting crossed tomahawks below a silhouette of the Capitol building. Prosecutors don\u2019t know how much money Jenkins has generated from the website\u2019s merchandise sales. But they said he has used another fundraising site to collect more than $118,000 in donations. \u201cFar from contemplating the harm he has caused, examining his conscience, feeling shame for his actions, and resolving to change, Jenkins has chosen to use his January 6 status to build a brand in order to garner money and attention,\u201d prosecutors wrote in a court filing. Defense attorney Dennis Boyle said Jenkins hasn\u2019t received money from the sale of Jan. 6 merchandise and doesn\u2019t own the site that sells it, although he couldn\u2019t say who does. U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta, who sentenced Jenkins, said it was \u201cshameful\u201d for him to capitalize on his role in the riot. The judge also rejected the notion that Jenkins and other jailed rioters are political prisoners who can\u2019t get a fair trial. \u201cNothing could be further from the truth,\u201d Mehta said. \u201cIt\u2019s all on video.\u201d Jenkins expressed remorse for his actions on Jan. 6, saying he got \u201ccaught up in the heat of the moment.\u201d \u201cI love this country,\u201d he told the judge. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not some crazed maniac set out to destroy this nation.\u201d Prosecutors had recommended a prison sentence of 19 years and eight months. They also asked the judge to impose a fine of at least $118,888, equaling the money Jenkins has publicly raised. Mehta denied their request for a fine. He also refused to impose a \u201cterrorism\u201d enhancement that would have significantly increased his sentencing guidelines. In March, a jury convicted Jenkins of charges including civil disorder and obstructing the Jan. 6 joint session of Congress for certifying the presidential election victory of Joe Biden, a Democrat, over Trump, a Republican. Jenkins flew from Houston to Washington, D.C., a day before Trump\u2019s rally near the White House on Jan. 6. Jenkins believed baseless claims that the 2020 presidential election had been stolen from Trump and envisioned that a \u201cmedieval melee style battle\u201d would erupt at the Capitol, prosecutors said. \u201cHis language invoked imagery of war and violent retribution, and his goal was to intimidate and retaliate against a government that would not install his preferred candidate,\u201d they wrote. Boyle said Jenkins\u2019 actions on Jan. 6 were motivated by a \u201cmisunderstanding about the election.\u201d \u201cThere remain many grifters out there who remain free to continue propagating the \u2018great lie\u2019 that Trump won the election, Donald Trump being among the most prominent,\u201d Boyle wrote. \u201cMr. Jenkins is not one of these individuals; he knows he was wrong.\u201d The defense lawyer said Jenkins endured a tumultuous, abusive upbringing to became a \u201cpillar in his community.\u201d When he was 20, Jenkins shot and killed his stepfather in self-defense after the man pointed a shotgun at him and made death threats, according to Boyle, who said Jenkins wasn\u2019t charged in the 1997 killing. Prosecutors acknowledged that Jenkins wasn\u2019t prosecuted for his stepfather\u2019s killing, but they said his \u201cextensive\u201d criminal record before Jan. 6 included assault convictions and shows he has a \u201cpenchant for violence.\u201d In July, Jenkins and 11 other inmates at the jail in Washington assaulted another Capitol riot defendant, Taylor Taranto, in a TV room, according to prosecutors. Taranto had been saying derogatory things about Ashli Babbitt, the rioter who was fatally shot by a police officer inside the Capitol, and Babbitt\u2019s mother, prosecutors said. Prosecutors have argued that Jenkins played a pivotal role in the Jan. 6 attack. He struck a windowpane six times with the spike end of the tomahawk that he had carried in a backpack. He pulverized and sprayed the shatter-resistant glass. \u201cAre we going in or not?\u201d he shouted at the crowd. After Jenkins stepped down from the window ledge, another rioter stepped in to break the window. \u201cIt is difficult to overstate the significance of Jenkins\u2019 actions at this location,\u201d prosecutors wrote. \u201cAs the first to attack this window, Jenkins crossed a line that had previously not been crossed at the (Lower West Terrace) \u2014 he had attacked the Capitol itself.\u201d Rioters eventually destroyed the window, allowing them to enter a conference room, where they made improvised weapons from the broken parts of wooden furniture. Mob members used the furniture pieces to attack police officers guarding an entrance in a tunnel on the Capitol\u2019s Lower West Terrace. More than 1,100 people have been charged with Jan. 6-related federal crimes. Approximately 800 of them have pleaded guilty or been convicted by juries or judges after trials in Washington. Over 650 have been sentenced, with roughly two-thirds of them receiving terms of imprisonment ranging from three days to 22 years, according to an Associated Press analysis of court records.",

    "content": "In this episode, the ComicBook Nation Crew reviews new horror films The Exorcist: Believer and Pet Sematary: Bloodlines as well as the much-anticipated premiere of Marvel's Loki Season 2 . PLUS: Reactions to Gen V Episode 4 , a full preview of WWE's Fastlane event, and the newest comics! The Exorcist: Believer Review (Photo: Universal Pictures) In his 2-star review of Exorcist: Believer , ComicBook Nation host Kofi Outlaw said the following: Exorcist: Believer captures the \"legacy\" of the original in name only \u2013 even after dragging the original film star Ellen Burstyn back into the franchise... an unbalanced mess of a story, that doesn't ever seem to know where to put its focus... The Exorcist: Believer feels like it will go down as an odd and misguided attempt at a direct sequel \u2013 one that fails to provide any new soul to the franchise... Loki Season 2 Review (Photo: Marvel Studios) In her Loki Season 2 review , ComicBook.com's Nicole Drum said the following: Loki may be one of the MCU's most innovative and significant offerings, and Season 2 of the series certainly maintains the spirit of the first season and pushes not only Loki's story but the future of the MCU forward. But like the Sacred Timeline itself, Loki Season 2 shows signs of coming apart in places with little bits that could stand refinement, reconsideration, or even just a strong bit of editing. Season 2 definitely doesn't suffer from some of the pitfalls that would make people continue to question if superhero fatigue is real or not, but through characterizations, pacing, and too much self-awareness, it definitely feels like a very different show. It's by no means bad, but it certainly feels like most of the fun will be in digesting each episode after the fact, rather than taking it in for what it is just while watching.

    "description": "Acting U.S. Secretary of Labor, Julie Su, has been in contact with both sides, and may take part in negotiations that are set to resume next Thursday in Oakland.",
    "content": "WALNUT CREEK, Calif. (KGO) -- On the last day of Kaiser workers' three-day strike, we're learning that the U.S. Department of Labor is getting involved to help bring an end to what is the largest health care strike in the U.S. history. Dave Regan, President of SEIU-UHW, addressed a crowd of striking Kaiser employees Friday morning at Kaiser Walnut Creek. \"Yes, (President Biden) supports the workers' collective bargaining work!\" said Regan. \"We got to run through the finish line. But we're winning this thing! Keep it up!\" Regan told employees that Acting U.S. Secretary of Labor, Julie Su, has been in contact with both sides, and may take part in negotiations that are set to resume next Thursday in Oakland. \"I think she played a valuable role. And I believe she will be willing to be involved to help us get an agreement,\" says Regan. RELATED: 75,000 Kaiser union workers walk off job on 1st day of strike over staffing issues, wages Kaiser employees took part in a planned three-day strike to raise concerns, in large part, over staffing shortages and to demand higher wages. A reported 75,000 workers took to the picket line, making this the largest healthcare strike in U.S. history. \"At the core of everything, we just don't have enough people to do the job,\" says Regan. \"Kaiser has refused to give us information we believe we are entitled to. That is why we think this is what's called, 'an unfair labor practice strike.'\" The union says the workload has increased, which impacts patient care. They want 10,000 new employees to be hired. In an email to ABC7 News on Tuesday, Kaiser claims the demand to hire 10,000 workers has been met, an assertion that Regan refutes. \"They say they have filled 10,000 positions. If you are really careful, most of that is people who are doing internal transfers,\" says Regan. \"They have not gotten there. They are parsing words. It's just not true.\" MORE: Kaiser strike: What it could mean for patients if 75,000 workers walk off job Kaiser declined interview requests with ABC7 News, stating it won't discuss details, \"out of respect for the bargaining process.\" But San Jose State University Professor Robert Ovetz has some concerns about the Biden administration's possible role in the negotiations. \"When the government steps in, they are stepping in effectively on the side of the employers,\" explains Professor Ovetz, who teaches political science. Ovetz, who is a union member himself, says the U.S. Department of Labor's involvement may force Kaiser back to the bargaining table. But he adds, when the government gets involved, it often forces workers to concede some of their demands. MORE: Gov. Newsom rejects bill to give unemployment checks to striking workers \"My concern here is that if they step in, and pressure the union not to strike a second time, that they may not achieve their main demand,\" he says. Still, Regan is optimistic that the end is in sight. \"It is not that it's too complicated, there are too many points of disagreement. It really is, this needs to be done. Let's do the right thing. We think we can have it done next week,\" says Regan. However, Regan did say if next week's negotiations fail, the coalition is planning an even longer strike beginning in November.

    "content": "The man charged with murder in the 1996 killing of Tupac Shakur knew the gravity of his arrest last week near his home on the outskirts of Las Vegas, according to police body camera footage released Friday. \u201cSo what they got you for, man?\u201d an officer asks Duane \u201cKeffe D\" Davis. \u201cBiggest case in Las Vegas history,\u201d Davis says, recounting the date that Shakur was gunned down \u2014 \u201cSeptember 7th, 1996.\u201d Police and prosecutors allege Davis was the mastermind behind the drive-by shooting near the Las Vegas Strip that killed Shakur at the age of 25. Now, more than 27 years later, Davis was handcuffed around the wrists and in ankle shackles in the backseat of Las Vegas police car headed toward a county jail, where he remains held without bond. \u201cI ain\u2019t worried,\" Davis told the officer. \"I ain\u2019t did (expletive).\u201d The police videos, totaling more than an hour of footage, show Davis arrested around sunrise on Sept. 29 while walking in his otherwise quiet neighborhood. \u201cHey, Keffe. Metro Police,\u201d an officer said. \u201cCome over here.\u201d Davis, holding a water bottle, cooperated as he was patted down and handcuffed next to an unmarked police vehicle. The 60-year-old had been a long-known suspect in the case. He publicly admitted his role in the killing in interviews ahead of his 2019 tell-all memoir, \u201cCompton Street Legend.\u201d His arrest came two months after police raided his home, renewing interest in one of hip-hop\u2019s most enduring mysteries. In the videos, Davis recalled the July 17 raid and peeking over a gate at the same time as a SWAT officer. He said his arrest that morning was much more low-key. As they drove on the freeway en route to police headquarters to interview Davis, he asks if he was followed the previous night. The officer says no. \u201cSo why you all didn\u2019t bring the media?\u201d Davis said. The officer asked why police would bring the media. \u201cThat\u2019s what you all do,\" Davis said. The self-described gangster from Compton, California, hasn\u2019t yet entered a plea in the case, and he denied a request from The Associated Press for an interview at the jail. His longtime lawyer in Los Angeles, Edi Faal, told AP he has no comment on Davis' behalf. Davis told police that he had moved to the Las Vegas area in January because of his wife's job. But the audio is redacted when police later ask him what he has been doing since the move. In an indictment unsealed last Friday in Clark County District Court, Davis is accused of orchestrating the killing of Shakur and providing his nephew, Orlando \u201cBaby Lane\u201d Anderson, with the gun to do it. Anderson, who denied involvement in Shakur's killing, died in 1998. Grand jurors also voted to add sentencing enhancements for the use of a deadly weapon and alleged gang activity. If Davis is convicted, that could add decades to his sentence. In Nevada, a person can be convicted of murder for helping another person commit the crime. Davis' first court appearance this week was cut short when he asked the judge for a postponement while he retains counsel in Las Vegas. He's due in court again Oct. 19. Authorities say Shakur\u2019s killing stemmed from a rivalry and competition for dominance in a musical genre that, at the time, was dubbed \u201cgangsta rap.\u201d It pitted West Coast members of a Crips sect that Davis has said he led in Compton against East Coast members of a Bloods gang sect associated with rap music mogul Marion \u201cSuge\u201d Knight, founder of Death Row Records, the music label representing Shakur at the time of his death. ___ Antczak reported from Los Angeles.

    "description": "Ariana Madix has bounced back from the Tom Sandoval cheating scandal, according to Lala Kent.",
    "content": "Lala Kent believes Ariana Madix is \"thriving\". The 38-year-old star split from Tom Sandoval earlier this year, after it emerged that he had a months-long affair with Raquel Leviss - but Lala is convinced that Ariana is now in a good place, as she competes on 'Dancing with the Stars'. Lala, 33, told The Messenger: \"She's definitely thriving. This is the best thing that ever happened to her.\" Ariana has a new boyfriend called Daniel, and Lala is thrilled that she's managed to move on from the cheating scandal. Lala - who starred alongside Ariana on 'Vanderpump Rules' - said: \"He seems like a very nice guy.\" Ariana recently claimed that her 'Dancing with the Stars' experience has helped her to move on from Tom. The reality star explained to 'Entertainment Tonight': \"I love to perform; I love to be on stage, and it\u2019s just nice to be kind of over here and doing this with the best partner. You know?\" Ariana has also cherished the support of her new boyfriend, who has sat among the audience every week. She shared: \"It\u2019s really, really nice. He's so supportive. \"So many of my best friends were here tonight, and they're just the best. And I'm so lucky I just feel like somehow, somewhere, the cosmic universe, whatever, I won the lottery when it comes to the best friends and the best support system. Truly.\" Meanwhile, Tom recently confessed that he regrets hurting Ariana. He said on the 'Everybody Loves Tom' podcast: \"I would never, ever want to hurt somebody like that. Even like my worst enemy. But I think that\u2019s why sometimes you end up hurting those people you care about the most is because of your strong connection with them.\"",

    "description": "Hollywood star Brie Larson has revealed that she relished making 'Lessons in Chemistry'.",
    "content": "Brie Larson loved having a hands-on role in the making of 'Lessons in Chemistry'. The 34-year-old actress has had an influence on both sides of the camera since the outset, and Brie has really relished the extra responsibility. The actress - who stars in the drama mini-series and also executive produces the show - told 'Entertainment Tonight': \"This is the first scripted series that I have developed from the beginning and will be through until the end. \"So being part of this collaboration and given the opportunity to have a voice besides just showing up and knowing my lines and doing the acting part of the job but getting to talk more about the script and the series as a whole, being on the edit when I'm not here on set, getting to be a part of all of it. \"I love the teamwork of the job and I like seeing it through so it works for me, that's kind of how my brain works is I want to be able to be there from the very beginning to go, 'OK, let's work on the script because this is where I want to go with this character,' and to have a team that's open to that.\" Brie plays the part of Elizabeth Zott - a chemist-turned-feminist-chef who fights against misogyny - on the show. The actress found that she was really able to relate to her on-screen character. She said: \"I relate to her in so many different ways but one of the things is just her resilience and how much life she goes through. And so the show gets to explore that and it kind of goes into everything - life as a whole, love, loss, chemistry, what it means to be alive on this planet. \"It goes through a lot, but does it in a way that is so sweet and buoyant and that is what I loved about the book because you kind of were caught off guard by how many weighty topics were in it because you always felt like it was buoyant and never got too self-serious.\"",

The comedian reluctantly celebrated the latest landmark during an appearance on 'The View' on Friday (06.10.23), when Joy was encouraged to embrace the moment by her co-stars. Sunny Hostin, who is one of Joy's co-hosts, noted that the veteran TV star \"[didn't] look excited\" about her birthday. Joy - who turns 81 on Saturday - then quipped: \"I can't get excited. I'm just glad I\u2019m alive, okay? \"You know, you get to a point where you wake up in the morning saying, 'I'm still here, my God!'\" During the show, the co-hosts were presented with a cannoli cake from Veniero's Pastry to mark the occasion. Joy joked: \"They've been around since the year I was born, 1894! Please check them out because they deliver nationwide and I don't want to be the only one indulging today. Cannoli cream is the best!\" In 2022, Joy insisted that she didn't have any retirement plans. The TV star loves her job and remains committed to 'The View'. She told PEOPLE: \"I just signed a contract so I'll be here for a while. I have no plans to retire.\" Joy feels proud of the show's success and revealed that she doesn't have any intention of walking away anytime soon. The co-host - who is the only original panellist who still appears on 'The View' - shared: \"It's really, you know, something that is an important show in many ways. Sometimes I don't believe that, as I've been here since the beginning, but we're the most-watched show in daytime. Most-watched! \"I'm happy to be a part of it. So no, I'm not going anywhere.

The 39-year-old singer and David, 73, have recorded a new version of 'Amazing Grace', and Katharine has revealed that the married couple had a \"debate\" before they agreed to put the song on their new album. The singer - who is set to release the second part of their 'Christmas Songs' album later this month - told 'Entertainment Tonight': \"We argued a little bit, not in the bad way. It\u2019s a bit of a debate over whether we should do \u2018Amazing Grace\u2019 because I said, 'It\u2019s not a Christmas song, it\u2019s a religious song.' \"The label ended up actually really liking it because we\u2019re using it as our first single to kind of get out there, kind of earlier before the whole Christmas craze without it beating you over the head that it\u2019s a Christmas song. So it\u2019s actually kind of cool that we did it.\" The loved-up duo have also toured together this year, and they've relished performing with each other on stage. David said: \"It\u2019s been great.\" Despite this, Katharine admits that it hasn't been entirely straightforward. The singer confessed that she's already grown weary of the constant traveling. The brunette beauty - who competed on 'American Idol' back in 2006 - said: \"Being together has not been the shlep. Just the constant packing and unpacking. \"You wake up in a new city every day and it\u2019s just a grind. That\u2019s the only part that sometimes wears on you.

    "content": "It's another home game for Manchester United as they look to avoid a three-match losing streak in all competitions when they welcome Brentford. Hampered with injuries, United are coming off of losing to Crystal Palace and Galatasaray and could be entering the international break in the bottom half of the Premier League, which would be as close to rock bottom as the club can get. Brentford are also on a poor run, winless in their last seven matches, and while Ivan Toney has returned to training, he won't be able to return to the pitch to help the Bees in the match. Here's our storylines, how you can watch the match and more: Question number one for Erik ten Hag is who plays left back? During Champions League, Sofyan Amrabat had to play out of position and the defense was in shambles. Doing the same against Brentford would be a recipe for disaster but with Sergio Reguilon still injured, ten Hag will need to get creative. If Amrabat does end up playing left back again, not only will he need coverage but Rasmus Hojlund will need to score a hat trick to end up getting by Brentford. Also down to bare bones in defense, Brentford have been looking for a way to right their attack without giving up too many goals and a trip to United could prove to be just what Thomas Frank needed. Even when struggling, the Bees are a dangerous team and if they can get chances from set plays, United will struggle. Manchester United's doldrums continue as they share points with Brentford at home. Manchester United 2, Brentford 2",

    "content": "Megan Rapinoe said in a game with playoff implications. OL Reign set a new NWSL attendance record as 34,130 fans packed Lumen Field in Seattle, Washington to thank Rapinoe in her final home match before retiring, and it ended in a 0-0 draw with the Washington Spirit. The result leaves their playoff fate up in the air, setting up an opportunity for fans to witness one more game for Rapinoe on the road against Chicago Red Stars with so much on the line. Depending on remaining games for other clubs, the Reign's final match against Chicago may determine whether or not they advance to the postseason at all. So for fans who still aren't quite ready to say goodbye, there's still time and hope for another magical Rapinoe moment. \"This was just always the place where I could be myself and be safe and be protected and just go out and try stuff,\" Rapinoe said to the crowd after the game. \"This was kind of my little training ground for other things that were on different stages. To be able to play here my whole career in one city ... just really special to be able to have this. So, just thank you to everyone. Hopefully a lot more to come this season. Certainly, a lot more to come after this season. I feel like in so many ways this is just the beginning.\" Here's how you can watch Rapinoe's final regular season NWSL match: The final match of the regular season will come down to a Decision Day scenario for sixth-place OL Reign and other clubs. San Diego Wave FC is the only team to have secured a spot in the playoffs but is still battling for a first-round bye, and the 2023 NWSL Shield -- awarded to the winningest team of the season. While no team can clinch the shield during this week, a playoff bye is still in play for San Diego, Portland or NJ/NY Gotham. The league table has never been closer with five playoff spots still up for grabs heading into the final weekend. OL Reign's draw against the Spirit, and a loss by Orlando Pride, gives them a little wiggle room. They cannot be knocked out of contention with the remaining games on Saturday and Sunday.

    "description": "Grilled cheese is a gooey fall favorite sandwich with plenty of ways to enhance it. Add cheese sticks to your next grilled cheese for the ultimate comfort food.",
    "content": "Grilled cheese is undeniably one of the most satisfying because it checks all the right boxes. It's a symphony of cheesy, buttery goodness encased in a crispy toast. Plus, it's one of the easiest dishes to prepare, making it accessible to almost anyone, even those who consider themselves kitchen novices. However, if you've never ventured into the realm of adding mozzarella sticks to your , you're truly missing out on a world of flavors. If you're already a fan of these crunchy, gooey sticks paired with marinara sauce, you probably need persuasion to try this combination. Yet, there are several compelling reasons why adding mozzarella sticks can elevate your grilled cheese game in terms of flavor and texture. First, when properly fried, mozzarella sticks develop a pleasing, crisp exterior that brings an exciting contrast to your sandwich. Second, adding mozzarella cheese contributes to that sought-after cheese pull, which is the hallmark of the perfect grilled cheese. Moreover, the creamy nature of mozzarella complements the nutty cheddar or smooth American cheese beautifully. Some preparation is required to infuse mozzarella sticks into your grilled cheese creation. You can't simply add to your bread and cheese slices before grilling; they need to be cooked separately first. The most effective way to cook mozzarella sticks at home is by using an . Consider using three to four mozzarella sticks for a standard grilled cheese sandwich. Monitoring the cooking time is essential to prevent the mozzarella cheese from oozing out of the sticks. Once done, let the mozzarella sticks cool slightly before adding them to the grilled cheese. While the mozzarella sticks are air frying, assemble and prepare your ingredients for the . After you've added half of the cheese to the bottom slice of bread, add the air-fried mozzarella sticks on top and then top with more cheese and the final piece of bread. While mozzarella cheese might not be the first choice for many when making grilled cheese, with American cheese and cheddar being more popular options, it's a fantastic choice to enhance the sandwich's overall appeal. The unique stretching process during its production results in a stretchiness that lends a delightful dimension to a grilled cheese sandwich. If you've ever witnessed the making of mozzarella cheese, you'll know that the stretching step transforms it into the gooey, stringy cheese we adore on pizza. This makes it an ideal addition to any grilled cheese. But, if you want to take things a step further, you could skip cheddar or American cheese and add more mozzarella or another great melting cheese like Fontina. Then, add a spoonful of marinara sauce to create a grilled cheese that tastes just like a plate of mozzarella sticks.",

Savage\u2019s lawyer, Charles Kuck, told The Associated Press in a statement Friday that his client has officially become a permanent U.S. resident and may now go overseas. He cleared a major traveling hurdle after being taken into custody by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in Georgia in 2019. Kuck said the Grammy-nominated artist followed \u201call applicable immigration laws since his initial detention by ICE.\u201d \u201cHis immigration court proceedings have now been terminated and he is a lawful permanent resident of the United States with the freedom to travel internationally,\u201d Kuck said. Savage, 30, whose given name is She\u2019yaa Bin Abraham-Joseph, spent 10 days in a detention center in southern Georgia before his release. He was arrested in a targeted operation over his visa, which expired in 2006. The Atlanta-based rapper said he had no idea what a visa was when his mother brought him to the U.S. at 7 years old. He said in a 2019 interview with the AP that immigrants like him who lived in America illegally as children should automatically become U.S. citizens. Savage said the visa application process discourages many immigrants who don\u2019t have documents because it \u201changs over your head forever.\u201d Savage made his announcement about returning to London via social media but did not give details.",

    "content": "STRAX Price Soars 85% Amid Upbit Dominance and Whales\u2019 Activity This significant spike in value has caught the attention of the cryptocurrency market, raising questions about its underlying causes and potential implications. What\u2019s particularly striking is that approximately 82% of today\u2019s trading volume for STRAX originates from the popular exchange Upbit. This concentration of activity on a single exchange has raised eyebrows within the crypto community. Furthermore, a wallet has accumulated a staggering 1.8 million STRAX tokens in the past 12 hours, representing approximately 1.2% of the total supply. This sizeable accumulation has added another layer of intrigue to the sudden price surge, according to data. Stratis\u2019s Impact Beyond Price Surge Stratis, the blockchain platform behind STRAX, offers businesses the ability to create applications on private blockchains, distinguishing itself with a practical approach. Notably, the Stratis development team goes beyond platform creation, providing consulting services to guide businesses in leveraging advanced blockchain technology. While the STRAX price soars, it\u2019s essential to exercise caution, as it may be linked to significant token accumulation by large investors. This situation calls for vigilance among traders and investors, emphasizing the need for thorough research before engaging in any transactions involving STRAX. The Stratis project, established in 2016, continues to evolve, demonstrating its commitment to practical blockchain solutions and adoption. Despite its particularly low profile in the industry, Stratis may hold the potential to deliver a substantial impact in the future.",

Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin FC Barcelona continue to monitor Estevao Willian at Palmeiras, who is known as 'Little Messi'. Twitter FC Barcelona are still interested in signing Palmeiras pearl Estevao Willian, who is known locally as 'Messinho' or 'Little Messi', according to Mundo Deportivo . The 16-year-old has tongues wagging once more for his latest display in a Brasileirao U17 match against Fluminense. Estevao Willian played a part in all four goals in the fixture as his team won 4-2. Scoring two goals and providing two assists, one of his strikes was a powerful header and the other a thunderous free kick. At one stage in the game, the woodwork denied him a hat trick when he let off another ripping dead ball. The teenager had already caught the attention of Europe's top clubs before this display, with Paris Saint-Germain having a \u20ac50 million ($53 million) bid for him turned down in recent months. Sao Paulo giants Palmeiras know the value of their prodigies, and how much moneyed outfits from the Old Continent are willing to pay for them after selling Endrick to Real Madrid in a deal that could reach \u20ac60 million ($63.6 million) last December. In Catalonia, Barca and their Brazil-born sporting director Deco are also great admirers of Estevao Willian and continue to monitor his progress. Earlier this summer, Deco was key in landing another South American promise in Vitor Roque, who should join Barca in January for a fixed fee of \u20ac30 million ($31.8 million) plus \u20ac31 million ($32.9 million) in variables from Athletico Paranaense.

Barca might struggle to raise the funds to buy him in 2024, but could agree something similar to the Vitor Roque deal with a good amount of fixed cash and a healthy sum in variables that would come Palmeiras' way at a later date. Swinging in the Blagurana's favor is that Estevao Willian has already told Mundo Deportivo it is his \"dream\" to play for Barca, and follow in the footsteps of his idol and nickname near-namesake Lionel Messi. This means that he might turn down offers from elsewhere, and wait for Deco and his team to make an approach in the coming months. Follow me on Twitter .

Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin WASHINGTON, DC \u2013 DECEMBER 4: Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL) speaks during testimony by constitutional ... [+] scholars before the House Judiciary Committee in the Longworth House Office Building on Capitol Hill December 4, 2019 in Washington, DC. This is the first hearing held by the Judiciary Committee in the impeachment inquiry against U.S. President Donald Trump, whom House Democrats say held back military aid for Ukraine while demanding it investigate his political rivals. The Judiciary Committee will decide whether to draft official articles of impeachment against President Trump to be voted on by the full House of Representatives. (Photo by Saul Loeb-Pool/Getty Images) Getty Images It is increasingly debated that the current generation of politicians, notably in the two Anglo-Saxon countries, are markedly inferior to those of prior generations \u2013 intellectually, morally and in their commitment to public service. Rory Stewart\u2019s new book (Politics on the Edge) highlights a number of examples. This is a view I have some sympathy for and a more compelling argument, supported by most politicians I have met, is that social media has debased politics and political debate, to the extent that the untrue and absurd garner greater attention from potential voters. Speeches at the Tory party conference last week (e.g. Penny Mordaunt) and the toppling of Kevin McCarthy by Matt Gaetz, are instances. One of many litmus tests of this hypothesis is that the quality and quantity of pithy, quotable remarks by political leaders and policymakers appears to have diminished. Outside of set-piece speeches there seems to be far fewer impressively intelligent public utterances from those in public life. As a result, essay writers are left digging for lesser used quotes from Churchill with which to start their notes. This is a pity, not just for essay writers, but for the public at large. Speeches Often, when those essay writers have exhausted the reservoir of Churchill quotes, they dip into Keynes. I recently happened upon a deep pool of quips from Keynes in Benn Steil\u2019s \u2018The Battle of Bretton Woods\u2019, which is a superb account of the tussle between Britain and America to shape the new world financial order and with it, bodies like the IMF. Tussle is too generous a word, the meeting effectively formalised the transfer of \u2018world power\u2019 from Britain to the US, or as Keynes wrote to his mother \u2018 In another year\u2019s time we shall have forfeited the claim we had staked out in the New World and in exchange this country will be mortgaged to America \u2019.

WWE SmackDown Results: Winners And Grades On October 6, 2023 23andMe User Data Stolen And Listed For Sale In Attack Targeting Ashkenazi Jews Keynes\u2019 prominent role at Bretton Woods was as foil to the American negotiator Harry Dexter White, and Keynes felt his place was to negotiate a deal for Britain that would rescue it from \u2018 losing face altogether and appearing to capitulate completely to dollar diplomacy .\u201d For some, Keynes was living proof of Lord Halifax\u2019 view that \u2018 they have all the money, and we have all the brains\u2019 . End of Eloquence From this point onwards, American financial dominance grew, manifested in the broad international use of its currency which has risen to a very particular place as the linchpin of the financial system. Indeed, one of the most important tenets of the twentieth-century world order and the rise of globalization has been the position of the dollar as the international reserve currency. This pre-eminence was christened in another memorable quote as \u2018exorbitant privilege\u2019 by Valery Giscard d\u2019Estaing, then French finance minister and later President. When Giscard made this statement, the dollar was tied to gold, and the response from France and a number of other countries was to exchange their holdings of dollars for gold. This set the stage for the subsequent breaking of the dollar\u2019s tie to gold by President Nixon. Since then, the dollar has been first among equals in the currency world, and many developing nations have pegged their currencies to it. Recently, as we have noted before, this notion of \u2018exorbitant privilege\u2019 has come under scrutiny in the sense that there is a long line of commentators predicting the demise of the dollar. A more interesting line of argument, thanks again to some French wizards (Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas and H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Rey) is the notion of \u2018exorbitant duty\u2019, which is the role that the dollar and US financial system play in times of crisis as the provider of a safe haven, even when those crises emanate from the US itself. As it stands, the next largest currency bloc to the dollar, the euro doesn\u2019t have capital markets deep enough to become a fully fledged global safe haven. It might be that a group of smaller countries \u2013 Switzerland and Australia for instance could also draw in capital in a crisis. So, the dollar may continue to do its duty, until perhaps it is undermined from within. While few in Washington will feel sorry for Kevin McCarthy, his removal represents another step towards the political unknown in America. Europeans and Asians are starting to worry about the prospect that Donald Trump could become president again and that the US might one day fail to do its \u2018duty\u2019. Congress has got it wrong before. One of the comments in the Steil book recounts how after Bretton Woods \u2018 Congress was spontaneously more generous toward China than toward England, perhaps because no one envisaged China as a postwar rival for power or commerce .\u201d Mike O'Sullivan Editorial Standards Print Reprints & Permissions",

    "description": "Exclusive interviews with Daniel Ellsberg and a long-buried memo reveal new details about one of the 20th century's biggest scoops. The post How Neil Sheehan Really Got the Pentagon Papers appeared first on The Intercept.",
    "content": "of March 23, 1971, New York Times reporter Neil Sheehan excitedly called Max Frankel, the Times\u2019s Washington bureau chief, to give him the news he had been waiting weeks to hear. \u201cI got it all,\u201d Sheehan told Frankel. Sheehan had just accomplished one of the greatest journalistic coups of the 20th century. He had obtained the Pentagon Papers, the Defense Department\u2019s 7,000-page secret history of the Vietnam War, which revealed that the government had been lying to the American people about the brutal conflict since it began. It was the first mass leak of classified documents in modern American journalism, four decades before WikiLeaks and Edward Snowden. But Sheehan had lied to his source, Daniel Ellsberg, a disillusioned former defense analyst turned whistleblower, to get the documents. He had secretly copied them after he had promised Ellsberg he wouldn\u2019t. Sheehan confessed to his editors that he had \u201cXeroxed the materials without permission and the source was unaware that he had done so,\u201d according to a remarkable and previously unpublished 1971 legal memo obtained by The Intercept. When confronted by an anxious Times lawyer, Sheehan insisted that the Pentagon Papers \u201cwere not stolen, but copied,\u201d according to the memo. The long-buried memo contains Sheehan\u2019s contemporaneous and confidential account of his relationship with Ellsberg, as well as Sheehan\u2019s version of events inside the Times as it prepared to publish the Pentagon Papers. It offers an unprecedented, real-time depiction of Sheehan\u2019s actions \u2014 including his phone call to Frankel and his admission to his editors that he had lied to his source. For decades after the Times published the Pentagon Papers, Daniel Ellsberg quietly seethed about what he saw as the deceitful way he was treated by Sheehan and the newspaper. He was furious when he discovered that Sheehan had lied to him repeatedly, and he remained mystified as to why Sheehan had misled him in ways that Ellsberg felt violated the basic tenets of a reporter-source relationship. To Ellsberg, the lies seemed gratuitous, as when Sheehan told him that the Times hadn\u2019t decided whether it was really interested in the Pentagon Papers, even as Sheehan and other reporters were furiously drafting stories based on the documents that Sheehan had secretly copied. He only found out that Sheehan had been lying to him when he was alerted by someone else at the Times the day before the first Pentagon Papers stories were splashed across the front page of the June 13, 1971, edition. Sheehan\u2019s behavior has been \u201ca great puzzle for me for 50 years,\u201d Ellsberg said in an interview conducted just months before he died in June at the age of 92. \u201cWhy did Neil Sheehan not tell me that the Times was coming out with this stuff?\u201d In his final months, Ellsberg was eager to talk \u2014 at greater length and in far more detail than ever before \u2014 about the dramatic backstory of the Pentagon Papers, and especially about his intense and volatile relationship with Sheehan and the newspaper. That relationship is further detailed in the newly unearthed memo, which is historically significant because it is based on confidential conversations between Sheehan and his lawyer in the days immediately after the Pentagon Papers were published. Mitchell Rogovin, Sheehan\u2019s lawyer in 1971, wrote the 14-page memo describing how Sheehan had obtained the documents, based on Rogovin\u2019s discussions with Sheehan right after the publication of the Pentagon Papers. At the time the memo was drafted, a federal grand jury in Boston was considering whether to indict Sheehan and the Times in connection with the publication of the classified documents. Rogovin wrote the memo for James Goodale, then the Times\u2019s general counsel, while both the Times and Sheehan were fighting the government\u2019s efforts to charge them. The Boston grand jury was disbanded without ever charging Sheehan or the Times, but the memo has survived, buried in legal files, and is only now being made public, long after the deaths of both Sheehan and Rogovin. Goodale mentioned the Rogovin memo and briefly quoted from it in his 2013 memoir, \u201cFighting for the Press,\u201d but The Intercept is publishing the full document here for the first time. \u201cIn February of 1971 Neil Sheehan was offered what has since been called the \u2018Pentagon Papers,\u2019\u201d the memo begins. \u201cHis source would make these materials available to the Times if it \u2018would handle it properly\u2019 \u2014 certain conditions were set forth.\u201d One Times editor told Sheehan that he was trying to obtain \u201cthe journalistic hydrogen bomb.\u201d The Rogovin memo and Ellsberg\u2019s extensive interviews in his final months offer competing views of what happened from the two main protagonists in the Pentagon Papers saga. Along with new interviews with other key figures, they offer a clearer and more nuanced view of the story behind one of the most significant events in American journalism. The publication of the Pentagon Papers is the origin story of the modern New York Times in the same way that Watergate is the origin story of the modern Washington Post. The decision to publish the classified documents transformed the Times from a staid centerpiece of the American establishment to a far more aggressive and professional news organization that no longer saw itself solely as a purveyor of official statements and authorized leaks. With the Pentagon Papers, adversarial journalism became the Times\u2019s ambition, rather than just an accidental byproduct of its conventional reportage. The backstory of how the Pentagon Papers ended up at the Times \u2014 and particularly the fraught relationships between Ellsberg, Sheehan, and the Times \u2014 has never been fully told. That is due in part to the fact that the Times, like most news organizations, has long resisted thoroughly recounting its own history. The newspaper is reluctant to shatter the myths that have grown up around its most famous act of journalism. That hidden backstory is complicated and messy, and for many years, none of the people involved wanted to speak publicly about what really happened. For his part, Ellsberg was happy that the Times actually published the documents, and he forgave Sheehan for his lies, even though he did not quite forget them. Despite his age, Ellsberg\u2019s memory was sharp during interviews conducted near the end of his life both for The Intercept and for my book, \u201c ,\u201d as he recounted the stunning story behind the historic leak, one that revealed his risk-taking and persistence as he stubbornly navigated the analog world of the late 1960s and early 1970s to reveal government secrets. Ellsberg did this in an era of rigid orthodoxy, when the idea of revealing classified material was considered heresy and terrified every political leader in Washington, even those deeply opposed to the Vietnam War. The defining moment in Ellsberg\u2019s life came when he finally succeeded in getting the story out and found himself at the center of a political firestorm sparked by the first mass leak of classified documents by a whistleblower in American history. Ultimately, Ellsberg became an iconic figure, an activist for democracy and press freedom; his fame was enhanced by the Nixon administration\u2019s decision to prosecute him for leaking the Pentagon Papers, followed by the revelation of the burglary of his psychiatrist\u2019s office by the infamous White House Plumbers, which led to the dismissal of his legal case and was a precursor to the Watergate scandal. Yet his prominence only served to worsen his ragged relationship with the Times, which didn\u2019t want to share the spotlight with its source. For decades after the publication of the Pentagon Papers, the Times distanced itself from Ellsberg. The newspaper\u2019s identity and status became so wrapped up in the groundbreaking stories that some at the paper were angry that Ellsberg\u2019s fame overshadowed the Times\u2019s and diluted the credit they thought was due the newspaper for its decision to publish the documents. \u201cHe stole our glory,\u201d Goodale said in an interview. At first, Daniel Ellsberg didn\u2019t intend to go to the press. For the man who would be remembered as one of the greatest sources in the history of American journalism, the press was a last resort. Before he became a world-famous rebel, Ellsberg was in the process of building a blue-chip career that easily could have taken him to the top of the American establishment. Born in Chicago in 1931, Ellsberg grew up in Detroit, went to Harvard, and served as an officer in the Marines before joining the RAND Corporation, an influential defense-oriented think tank, where he worked as an analyst focusing on nuclear strategy. He earned a doctorate in economics, specializing in decision theory, and by 1964, he was a staffer at the Pentagon under the ultimate technocrat, Defense Secretary Robert McNamara. He later spent two years in South Vietnam working under Gen. Edward Lansdale, who tried and failed to apply the counterinsurgency and psychological warfare tactics he had used in the Philippines in the 1950s to the Vietnam War. His time in Vietnam convinced Ellsberg that the murderous war could not be won. After returning to RAND in 1967, Ellsberg joined other analysts to work on a secret, 47-volume history of the war commissioned by McNamara. To help write the history, Ellsberg gained access to highly classified documents that revealed in stunning detail the deceit at the heart of U.S. policy in Vietnam. Ellsberg realized that the American people needed to know the truth. He came to believe that exposing the secret history could help end the war. In September 1969, he covertly took a copy of the Pentagon Papers from RAND. Along with his friend Anthony Russo and Russo\u2019s girlfriend, Linda Sinay, Ellsberg began to copy the Pentagon Papers, while trying to decide how best to publicize their findings. After talking with a lawyer about the odds that he would be prosecuted for leaking the documents, Ellsberg said that he calculated that he was less likely to be charged for giving the papers to a member of Congress than he would be if he gave them to the press. He also believed that congressional hearings would give the Pentagon Papers greater credibility and have a bigger impact than stories in a newspaper. He first turned to Sen. J. William Fulbright. Ellsberg sought out the Arkansas Democrat in November 1969 because he was the powerful chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and had led congressional hearings that gave voice to the war\u2019s skeptics. Ellsberg took the risk of providing some of the Pentagon Papers to Fulbright in a meeting with the senator\u2019s staff present. \u201cI wanted them all to witness that [Fulbright] had held some of these papers, so he couldn\u2019t say afterwards, \u2018Oh, that was some staff thing\u2019\u201d that the senator didn\u2019t personally know about, Ellsberg recalled in an interview. \u201cSo, in front of everybody, I hand him this thing.\u201d Ellsberg gave Fulbright highly classified sections of the Pentagon Papers relating to U.S. diplomacy that he later refused to give Sheehan and the Times because he thought they were too sensitive to be published in a newspaper, according to the Rogovin memo. But after initially expressing interest, Fulbright backed off, fearful of the consequences of going public with stolen classified material. In December 1970, Fulbright finally told Ellsberg he wasn\u2019t going to do anything with the documents. Ellsberg tried other lawmakers in early 1971, believing that Congress was the safest and most effective place for him to make the Pentagon Papers public, but he was repeatedly rebuffed, including by Sen. George McGovern, the anti-war liberal Democrat from South Dakota who later ran for president; Sen. Gaylord Nelson, a liberal Democrat from Wisconsin; and Sen. Charles Mathias, a liberal Democrat from Maryland. Ellsberg had na\u00efvely hoped that his efforts to publicize the documents would remain secret even as he was rather recklessly talking to so many different senators. But inevitably, his conversations on Capitol Hill were soon shared. When Ellsberg talked with McGovern again a week after their initial meeting, McGovern told him that he and Nelson had compared notes and found that they were both talking to Ellsberg about the Pentagon Papers. \u201cHe tells me he\u2019s talked to Gaylord Nelson,\u201d Ellsberg recalled. McGovern said that when he\u2019d told Nelson about the classified documents he had been offered, Nelson responded: \u201cWas that Ellsberg?\u201d Discouraged, Ellsberg was having lunch in the Senate cafeteria by himself when he recognized I.F. Stone, the famous independent journalist, sitting at a nearby table. Ellsberg was a fan of Stone. \u201cI recognized [Stone] by his bottle glasses,\u201d Ellsberg recalled. \u201cAnd so I decided to tell him what I was doing. \u2018I have these top-secret documents, the whole history of the war.\u2019\u201d Ellsberg poured out his frustrations to Stone about his inability to get any prominent senator to go public with the Pentagon Papers. \u201cHe looked at me, and he did have tears in his eyes, and he said, \u2018God bless you for what you\u2019re doing.\u2019\u201d Even as he continued to try to get someone in Congress to take action, Ellsberg turned to a left-wing Washington-based think tank, the Institute for Policy Studies. In August 1970, he gave the group about 1,000 pages of the 7,000-page history. One of the organization\u2019s leaders was Marcus Raskin \u2014 the father of Rep. Jamie Raskin, a Maryland Democrat who played a leading role in the House investigation of the January 6, 2021, insurrection. Ellsberg agreed to let Marcus Raskin and two others at IPS \u2014 Richard Barnet and Ralph Stavins \u2014 use the documents for a book they were working on about the Vietnam War, as long as they did so only on background, meaning they wouldn\u2019t acknowledge publicly that they possessed the classified history or quote from it directly. Without Ellsberg\u2019s knowledge, the IPS researchers gave a copy of the 1,000 pages to Neil Sheehan. Rep. Jamie Raskin said in an interview that his father gave Sheehan copies of the Pentagon Papers because he was frustrated that Ellsberg was being too cautious and taking too long to make them public. \u201cI recall my dad telling me that he urged Dan to go public as quickly as possible,\u201d Raskin said. \u201cAt a certain point my dad decided to share the Pentagon Papers with New York Times reporter Neil Sheehan to hasten public exposure of the criminality of the war.\u201d Decades later, Marcus Raskin finally told Ellsberg what had happened: Raskin said that he and the other IPS researchers thought they had secretly reached a deal with Sheehan. In return for giving the Times the documents, Sheehan had told Raskin and the other IPS researchers that the Times would agree to coordinate the publication of its stories based on the documents with the release of the think tank\u2019s book on Vietnam. In addition, Sheehan agreed to two other conditions: On the same day that the Times published its stories on the documents, it would also publish a review of the think tank\u2019s book and a column by Raskin about U.S. war crimes in Vietnam. Raskin, Barnet, and Stavins had originally proposed the deal to Sheehan, who said that he would have to check with his editors before he could agree to the conditions. Sheehan later told Raskin and the others that the Times editors had approved the deal, so the IPS researchers gave him the documents. But the Times did not abide by that deal, and there is no evidence that Sheehan ever actually talked to any of his editors about it. By the time Raskin and Barnet finally told Ellsberg about their supposed deal with Sheehan, he had long known , and he had been angry for years that they had done so behind his back. But Ellsberg found that they were also bitter over what they saw as Sheehan\u2019s betrayal. \u201cI learned from Raskin and Barnet, bit by bit, but then, all of it, the story\u201d of what had happened, Ellsberg said. \u201cThey gave [the documents] to him, both Raskin and Barnet told me, on a deal that probably no newspaper had ever made, before or since.\u201d Ellsberg said he was flabbergasted. \u201c\u2018Jeez,\u2019 I said to Raskin, \u2018is there any newspaper that ever made a deal like that?\u2019 And he said, \u2018No, but those were our conditions for giving him the stuff.\u2019\u201d \u201cRaskin was very firm on this point,\u201d Ellsberg said. \u201cHe said, \u2018Absolutely, we had those conditions, he agreed, and they betrayed us.\u2019\u201d When he asked why they had not told him about this supposed deal decades earlier, Ellsberg said that Barnet admitted that they had felt humiliated by the entire episode. \u201cI learned this 30 years later,\u201d Ellsberg said. \u201cI said, \u2018Dick, how could you not have told me this stuff?\u2019 He said, \u2018We were embarrassed. I was embarrassed at the way we treated you.\u2019\u201d \u201cWhen he told me the story, Marcus was very angry,\u201d Ellsberg recalled. Sheehan \u201csimply lied to them as a reporter,\u201d Ellsberg said. That was \u201ctotally in line with my dealings with Sheehan.\u201d (Marcus Raskin died in 2017, Barnet died in 2004, and Stavins died earlier this year.) Former New York Times editors who were directly involved in the publication of the Pentagon Papers said in interviews that Sheehan never told them he had agreed to a deal with Raskin and IPS. In fact, they said, they didn\u2019t even know at the time that Sheehan had first obtained a portion of the Pentagon Papers from IPS, rather than from Ellsberg. \u201cSheehan never told me he got some of the documents from Raskin and IPS,\u201d said Frankel, Sheehan\u2019s boss when the outlet published the Pentagon Papers and one of the handful of senior editors directly involved in the project. \u201cI never heard of any deal that Sheehan had made with IPS and Raskin. They would have to have been very na\u00efve to believe that Sheehan could make that deal.\u201d \u201cAt the time, I was under the assumption that all 7,000 pages were all from Ellsberg,\u201d added James Greenfield, the Times\u2019s foreign news editor in 1971 and the project manager for the Pentagon Papers. The Rogovin memo doesn\u2019t provide conclusive answers about Sheehan\u2019s interactions with IPS or reveal exactly what Sheehan told his editors about IPS\u2019s role. The references to IPS in the memo are intriguing, but fragmentary. On April 2, 1971, according to the memo, Sheehan told Frankel about \u201cthe book that IPS was working on and how this could be used as a lever against the source.\u201d That suggests that Sheehan told Frankel that IPS had some of the documents and that he thought he could somehow use that knowledge to pressure Ellsberg to the Times\u2019s advantage. But it doesn\u2019t indicate that he told Frankel that he had obtained those documents from IPS. Later, during an April 21, 1971, meeting with Times editors, Sheehan mentioned \u201cthe involvement of the Institute for Policy Studies,\u201d but the memo doesn\u2019t say whether Sheehan said anything more about IPS than what he had previously told Frankel, whom the memo shows also attended the meeting. The memo\u2019s final reference to IPS indicates that at some point not long before the Pentagon Papers were published, Sheehan arranged for a Times secretary to travel from New York to Washington \u201cto deliver some materials\u201d to Sheehan\u2019s wife. Susan Sheehan then \u201cin turn, gave them to IPS,\u201d the memo states. It seems likely that after he obtained the full set of the Pentagon Papers from Ellsberg, Sheehan asked his wife to return the portion of the Pentagon Papers he had obtained from IPS. But it is not clear from the memo whether anyone else at the Times knew that\u2019s what he was doing. Susan Sheehan said in an interview that she doesn\u2019t recall the episode involving her and the delivery of materials to IPS that is described in the memo. She also said that she doesn\u2019t recall any sort of deal between her husband and the IPS researchers, adding that they all remained on good terms after the Pentagon Papers were published. Yet it is easy to see why Neil Sheehan might not have been completely forthcoming with his editors about the role of IPS. At the time, Raskin, Barnet, Stavins, and other IPS researchers were considered wild-eyed leftist activists by the Washington establishment, and Times management might have been concerned if they had known that some of the documents were coming from the group. \u201cThey did not want to be associated with IPS,\u201d Ellsberg said. In early 1971, Raskin, Barnet, and Stavins met with Ellsberg and urged him to meet with Sheehan. Ellsberg, frustrated by the failure of his other plans for making the documents public, agreed. By the time they began to discuss the Pentagon Papers, Ellsberg and Sheehan had known each other for several years. Ellsberg said in an interview that he had secretly leaked some information to Sheehan for a story about Vietnam in 1968; they met again two years later at a dinner party hosted by Tony Lake, a former aide to Richard Nixon\u2019s national security adviser, Henry Kissinger. Lake had recently resigned from Kissinger\u2019s staff in response to the June 1970 invasion of Cambodia. (Lake later served as national security adviser for President Bill Clinton.) At the time of the dinner in the fall of 1970, Sheehan was working as a reporter in the Washington bureau of the Times. He had spent years in Vietnam covering the war, first for UPI and later for the Times, and had gained a stellar reputation; along with Times reporter David Halberstam, Sheehan had been among the first American reporters to write skeptical stories about the war. But at the dinner, Sheehan seemed adrift. He told Ellsberg he was frustrated with the Times, complaining that he couldn\u2019t get the newspaper\u2019s editors interested in the stories he wanted to write about the ongoing war, Ellsberg recalled. Sheehan told Ellsberg that the paper \u201cis done with Vietnam.\u201d Ellsberg did not mention the Pentagon Papers to Sheehan at the dinner; instead, he came away from their conversation convinced that the Times would not be interested in them. Sheehan \u201csays, \u2018They won\u2019t let me cover Vietnam. They\u2019ve got me covering other domestic stuff. They\u2019re just not interested.\u2019 And so I had the feeling from that, well, no use giving them top-secret stuff,\u201d Ellsberg said in an interview. So when Raskin and the other IPS researchers later recommended that Ellsberg meet with Sheehan \u2014 still not revealing that they had already given the reporter a portion of the documents \u2014 Ellsberg was skeptical. \u201cI had lunch or dinner with Stavins and Raskin and Barnet, and they say I should put this out in the New York Times,\u201d Ellsberg recalled. \u201cAnd they say, \u2018Do you know Neil Sheehan?\u2019 I say, \u2018Yes,\u2019 but that I had gotten the impression from him that [the Times] are not \u2026 promising. And they say, \u2018We think you ought to try him again.\u2019\u201d \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have done it if they hadn\u2019t suggested it.\u201d Early in 1971, Ellsberg came to Washington for dinner with some friends. He was planning to stay with his friend John Paul Vann, whom he knew from Vietnam, where Vann had served as a senior civilian adviser. But Ellsberg couldn\u2019t find Vann that night, so he called Sheehan to see if he could spend the night at his house. (Sheehan later wrote a Pulitzer Prize-winning book, \u201cA Bright Shining Lie,\u201d about Vann and his role in Vietnam.) Sheehan set up a cot for Ellsberg in his basement, and they stayed up all night talking about Vietnam. Sheehan showed Ellsberg the galleys of a review he had written for the Times of books about American war crimes there. \u201cHe said, \u2018I\u2019m having a lot of trouble with the editors on this,\u2019\u201d Ellsberg recalled. \u201cI read it in his D.C. basement. Very good! This is very good stuff. So I thought, \u2018OK, he\u2019s the guy.\u2019\u201d So that night, Ellsberg began to tell Sheehan about the Pentagon Papers. \u201cAnd I mention to him that Dick Barnet and Marcus Raskin had suggested [that I talk to him], and I told him that I had given [the documents] to IPS. He said, \u2018I had some inkling that IPS had some of this material, I have heard of it before.\u2019 He didn\u2019t admit at all that they had given [him] any\u201d of the documents. Ellsberg offered to show Sheehan the Pentagon Papers, and Sheehan agreed to come to Cambridge, Massachusetts, where Ellsberg was then living, to read them. \u201cHe could have told me, \u2018I\u2019ve got some of this already, and we\u2019re going with it,\u2019\u201d Ellsberg said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t tell me. He didn\u2019t say he had it, or that they were going full speed with the 1,000 pages.\u201d \u201cAround March 3, 1971,\u201d Sheehan first told his editors at the Times about the possibility of \u201cpublishing the D.O.D.\u2019s history of U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War,\u201d the Rogovin memo states. A few days later, the memo adds, James Reston, the legendary Times Washington columnist and editor, \u201cwalked up to Neil as he was entering the elevator and told him \u2018You have clearance, young man.\u2019\u201d On March 13, at the Gridiron Club dinner, an annual gathering of politicians and journalists in Washington, Frankel \u201ccalled Jim Goodale aside and told him to read the law on classified documents because they might have a story involving a lot of classified documents,\u201d the memo states. About two weeks after their all-night talk in Washington, Sheehan went to Cambridge to read through the full set of the Pentagon Papers. But Ellsberg imposed some conditions on the reporter. He told Sheehan that he didn\u2019t want him to just write a quick daily story based on the documents, but instead wanted the Times to do a big, deep dive into the secret history. \u201cI don\u2019t want it to be a one-day story,\u201d Ellsberg recalled telling Sheehan. He said he wanted the Times to \u201cgive a lot of space to it.\u201d Ellsberg said in an interview that he didn\u2019t want to go to prison for a news story that came and went without much impact. Frankel told Sheehan that the Times would probably go along with that demand, according to the Rogovin memo. \u201cWe might well take it under the conditions your source wants, i.e. using it all or very large chunks. We\u2019re very interested,\u201d Frankel said, according to the memo. But Ellsberg\u2019s other big condition was more difficult. He told Sheehan that he could read the documents \u2014 but not make copies. \u201cYou can read as much as you want, you can take notes as much as you need, but I\u2019m asking you not to copy them until we have an agreement, an interest at the Times\u201d in publishing stories about them, Ellsberg recalled telling Sheehan. \u201cBecause I had gotten the impression from Neil earlier that they were very unlikely to print this top-secret stuff.\u201d By that time, Ellsberg had discovered to his horror that IPS had copies of the Pentagon Papers openly lying around \u201call over the place\u201d in its Washington office. He feared that if he let Sheehan copy the documents before the Times had agreed to publish stories about them, they might wind up lying around openly at the newspaper as well, and that someone might discover them there and call the FBI. So Ellsberg wanted an assurance from Sheehan that the Times was serious about publishing before he agreed to let him copy the documents. Sheehan wouldn\u2019t give him that assurance and in fact, misled him into thinking that the Times was still on the fence. \u201cI said, \u2018I don\u2019t want this stuff sitting around the Times indefinitely,\u2019\u201d Ellsberg said he told Sheehan. \u201c\u2018If they are really interested and think they would like to use them, you got it, you got the whole thing.\u2019 He wouldn\u2019t tell me that. He never did. He could have said, \u2018Yes, they intend to do it.\u2019 They were already working on it. He didn\u2019t tell me that. He lied.\u201d When Sheehan arrived in Cambridge, Ellsberg and his wife, Patricia, were frazzled and burned out by an unexpected development. While they had waited for Sheehan to arrive, Ellsberg had met with Tom Oliphant, a reporter for the Boston Globe, and mentioned the Pentagon Papers. Oliphant quickly wrote a story in the Globe about the secret history, which thus became the first news story disclosing the documents\u2019 existence. When he read the Globe story, Ellsberg panicked. Even though he had not leaked the papers to the Globe, he feared that the story might convince the government that he was about to leak them to the press. In an interview, Oliphant said that Ellsberg\u2019s recollection about his story for the Globe was accurate, adding that the response he got to his story suggests that Ellsberg was right to worry about the government. \u201cThe day after my story ran, I was contacted by Kissinger\u2019s office,\u201d Oliphant recalled. \u201cThey wanted multiple copies of it.\u201d Ellsberg and his wife worked around the clock to make as many copies of the documents as they could. \u201cPatricia and I started making more copies, literally without sleep. \u2026 We start putting them in more places around Harvard Square\u201d in the apartments of people Ellsberg trusted. \u201cFor five or six days, we had hardly any sleep, waiting for the FBI,\u201d he recalled. When Sheehan arrived, Ellsberg was jittery and off-kilter. \u201cLooking back, I knew he regarded me somehow as kind of wild,\u201d Ellsberg said. \u201cPatricia and I hadn\u2019t slept for a week, and we were both on caffeine.\u201d What\u2019s more, when Ellsberg showed Sheehan the Globe story, \u201che seemed scared.\u201d With Ellsberg talking openly about the Pentagon Papers to another reporter, Sheehan may have feared that his source was out of control. Ellsberg then made a puzzling decision. He went on vacation and left Sheehan with a key to the apartment in Cambridge where the Pentagon Papers were stored, telling Sheehan he could continue reading them while Ellsberg was gone. \u201cI gave the key to Neil and said, \u2018Neil, I\u2019m counting on you not to copy this. Just, you know, you can make notes, but no Xerox.\u2019 And he says, \u2018Absolutely, absolutely, no problem.\u2019\u201d On their vacation, Ellsberg recalled, his wife told him: \u201cHe\u2019ll copy it.\u201d \u201cAnd I said, \u2018I don\u2019t think so, he promised me he wouldn\u2019t.\u2019\u201d But that is exactly what Sheehan did. \u201cOn March 20 or 21st, Neil called [Times editor] Bill Kovacs and asked him to obtain a Xeroxer for him,\u201d under an assumed name and to \u201cget money from New York to pay for reproduction,\u201d the Rogovin memo states. \u201cThe following day, when Kovacs brought [$400] to Neil, he was told in very general terms why Neil was in Boston.\u201d On the night of March 23, Sheehan made his call to Frankel to tell him he \u201cgot it all,\u201d according to the Rogovin memo. The next day, Sheehan met with his editors in Washington and \u201ctold them what he had and why he had handled it the way he did. Neil stressed his obligation to protect his source.\u201d Frankel asked Sheehan to write a memo \u201con what the materials contained and how the stories might be written.\u201d Sheehan gave him the memo on March 28, which Frankel delivered to the newspaper\u2019s top brass. Frankel told Sheehan that \u201cNew York was excited.\u201d Weeks before the Times published the Pentagon Papers, Sheehan called Ellsberg and told him that the Times had still not decided whether it was interested in the documents. \u201cHe phoned me from New York,\u201d Ellsberg recalled. \u201cHe said, \u2018They have not made a decision, they are waffling on this.\u2019 False.\u201d Ellsberg recalled that Sheehan then told him that \u201c\u2018they have me working on other things, but I want to be ready to use it if they ever do make a decision on this, so I want to continue to read it, so I need a copy for that.\u2019\u201d That was when Ellsberg finally agreed to let Sheehan copy the Pentagon Papers, telling him to go to Patricia\u2019s New York apartment, where he had stored a copy. Ellsberg said he would arrange for the doorman at the apartment building to let Sheehan in. \u201cI said, \u2018All right, you can have a copy.\u2019 I said to him, \u2018When I give you a copy, I understand it is out of my hands. I know I don\u2019t have any control over it.\u2019\u201d Ellsberg recalled that the phone conversation was in April 1971, but Rogovin\u2019s memo states that \u201con May 27th Neil\u2019s source gave him \u2018official permission\u2019 to possess the papers.\u201d (While the memo never mentions Ellsberg by name in order to protect his identity, it is clear that whenever Sheehan talks about the \u201csource,\u201d he is referring to Ellsberg. In the memo, Sheehan described the \u201csource\u201d as someone who had \u201cseen a number of senators in an effort to have them publicly reveal the content of the papers but to date had been unsuccessful.\u201d) When Ellsberg gave Sheehan permission to copy the documents, Ellsberg still didn\u2019t know that Sheehan had long since done so, or that Sheehan and other reporters and editors were holed up at a New York hotel writing stories about them. Based on what Sheehan told him, Ellsberg still believed that the Times wasn\u2019t interested in the documents, so he kept searching for other ways to make them public, even after he told Sheehan to go to Patricia\u2019s apartment to pick up a set of the papers. Why did Sheehan take the risk that Ellsberg would find another outlet for the documents, Ellsberg wondered, decades later. \u201cIf he\u2019d said, \u2018Dan, I have to tell you, I have a copy of it,\u2019 I would have said, \u2018You know, OK, fine,\u2019\u201d Ellsberg said, just so long as the Times was committed to writing about the secret history. In fact, the Rogovin memo shows that the Times was worried that Ellsberg was still distributing the documents to other people, and that other news organizations might soon get them. As it scrambled to publish its stories, the Times discovered that Ellsberg had given some documents to Rep. Pete McCloskey, a liberal, anti-war Republican from California, and Times editors feared that McCloskey would give the documents to the Los Angeles Times, according to the Rogovin memo. To determine McCloskey\u2019s plans, Bob Phelps, an editor in the New York Times\u2019s Washington bureau, met with the politician, who promised that \u201che would not turn over what he had to another paper,\u201d the memo states. While Sheehan tried to keep Ellsberg at bay and the Times prepared to publish the documents, the newspaper was grappling with other problems. The Times editors felt they had to be careful in choosing which reporters to bring onto the project to work with Sheehan, according to the Rogovin memo. \u201cThe people selected were picked for competence and loyalty,\u201d the memo states. \u201cOne reporter was rejected because his wife was a \u2018peacenik,\u2019 he wasn\u2019t considered discreet and she might talk.\u201d The reporters and editors worked in secret in the New York Hilton, which was chosen after the editors rejected proposals to move the operation to either Tarrytown, New York, or Charlottesville, Virginia, according to the memo. By late April, they had two copies of the Pentagon Papers at the hotel, where the Times had also moved typewriters, filing cabinets, a safe, and other supplies. A third copy of the papers was stored at Greenfield\u2019s apartment after Goodale insisted that none of the copies be kept inside the Times building, according to the memo. \u201cDuring the next month work began, additional people joined the Hilton group and the pressure to meet deadlines started to build,\u201d the Rogovin memo says. But even as the Times built a large Pentagon Papers team, Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, the Times publisher known by his nickname, Punch, still hadn\u2019t given his final approval to publish. He was under pressure from some Times executives, as well as the paper\u2019s outside law firm, which strongly urged against any publication at all, even of stories about the documents, according to Goodale, Greenfield, and Frankel. (The outside firm, Lord Day & Lord, dropped the Times as a client right after the publication of the Pentagon Papers.) Sulzberger was especially hesitant about publishing the actual documents. \u201cHe tried to split the baby in half, and only publish stories without publishing the documents,\u201d recalled Frankel in an interview. \u201cWe said that you have to publish the documents to provide strong evidence of what the Pentagon was thinking. He finally agreed, after I made it clear to him that there were no real secrets in these papers. They were policy studies, not military secrets.\u201d Punch Sulzberger died in 2012. His son, Arthur Sulzberger Jr., who succeeded him and served as publisher until 2018, declined to comment for this story. In the end, Punch Sulzberger agreed with his editors. The Rogovin memo states that \u201cby June 6 Neil finished his second piece [in the Pentagon Papers series] \u2026 around that time Greenfield came over to report on the publisher\u2019s decision regarding publication.\u201d On Saturday, June 12, 1971, Ellsberg got a call from Tony Austin, who worked on the New York Times Magazine. Ellsberg had given Austin the volume of the Pentagon Papers that dealt with the Gulf of Tonkin incident for a book Austin was writing. In August 1964, when U.S. Navy ships ventured into North Vietnamese territorial waters in the Gulf of Tonkin, President Lyndon Johnson and the Pentagon lied about the North Vietnamese response, falsely claiming the North Vietnamese had assaulted the ships. Johnson then used the trumped-up incident to win congressional passage of what became known as the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, which became Johnson\u2019s justification to dramatically escalate the war by sending in conventional combat forces. \u201cSo on Saturday, June 12, I get a call from Tony Austin, and he\u2019s almost in tears,\u201d recalled Ellsberg. \u201cHe says, \u2018Dan, my book is ruined. You know that study you gave me? They have the whole study, and they are going to publish starting tonight. They are totally going to scoop my book.\u2019\u201d \u201cI asked him how he knew what the Times was planning. He says, \u2018The place is locked down.\u2019\u201d Ellsberg had not heard anything from Sheehan. He tried to call but couldn\u2019t reach him. Sheehan later confessed that he was avoiding Ellsberg. But Ellsberg did reach Greenfield that day. \u201cHe got me on the phone, and he expressed some doubts about what was happening,\u201d Greenfield recalled. \u201cHe seemed rattled.\u201d \u201cI said, \u2018It\u2019s too late now. It\u2019s all in print.\u2019\u201d \u201cAt 6 p.m. June 12th, the presses began rolling,\u201d the Rogovin memo states. That night in Cambridge, Ellsberg, his wife, and some friends smoked marijuana and went to see the movie \u201cButch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.\u201d \u201cWe got stoned out of our minds to see \u2018Butch Cassidy\u2019 for about the fourth time, and it was most enjoyable,\u201d Ellsberg recalled. After the movie, he went to the kiosk in Harvard Square where the early editions of the next morning\u2019s New York Times were on sale. \u201cOf course, I\u2019m furious at Neil for not telling me. But when I go and there is the paper at midnight, wow, great, all is forgiven, you know, no problem.\u201d Months later, Ellsberg ran into Sheehan walking on Fifth Avenue in New York. It was the first time they had spoken since the Pentagon Papers had been published. \u201cSo we go into a doorway, and I grill him a little bit,\u201d Ellsberg said. \u201cAnd he said, \u2018Dan, it was bigger than both of us, you know, I had to do what I had to do,\u2019\u201d Ellsberg recalled. \u201cSo, OK.\u201d After Neil Sheehan died in 2021, the Times published an interview he had done with the paper six years earlier on the condition that it not be released until after his death. In it, Sheehan acknowledged that he had kept Ellsberg at arm\u2019s length because he didn\u2019t think he could trust him with the knowledge that the Times was going ahead with the publication of the Pentagon Papers. Sheehan knew that Ellsberg had already talked to a wide range of people both in Congress and elsewhere about the documents, and that it was only a matter of time before the Nixon administration discovered what Ellsberg was doing. That would lead the government to the Times. \u201cThere\u2019s no way The Times can protect this guy,\u201d Sheehan in the interview. Ellsberg had \u201cleft tracks on the ceiling, on the walls, everywhere \u2026 sooner or later, I was afraid he was going to run into a politician who\u2019d go right to the Justice Department.\u201d The relationship between Ellsberg and the Times following the publication of the Pentagon Papers was equally messy. In particular, Ellsberg complained that the Times was sloppy in its efforts to protect him as a source. Soon after the newspaper began publishing the Pentagon Papers, Sidney Zion, a freelance writer who had previously worked for the Times, went on a New York radio show and revealed that Ellsberg was the source of the documents. \u201cThe only person I had dealt with was Neil Sheehan, and no one else at the paper was supposed to know,\u201d Ellsberg said \u2014 a statement at odds with Greenfield\u2019s recollection that Ellsberg called him the day before the documents were published. Zion, who died in 2009, that Ellsberg\u2019s identity was common knowledge in New York media circles. More recently, Ellsberg was angered by the 2021 Times story based on the interview with Sheehan. He especially took issue with Sheehan\u2019s claim that \u201ccontrary to what is generally believed, Mr. Ellsberg never \u2018gave\u2019 the papers to The Times. \u2026 Mr. Ellsberg told Mr. Sheehan that he could read them but not make copies.\u201d The Rogovin memo shows that account to be inaccurate, since the memo says that Ellsberg ultimately gave Sheehan \u201cpermission to possess the papers.\u201d \u201cNever gave it to them?\u201d Ellsberg said in an interview. \u201cThat\u2019s crazy.\u201d Nixon initially didn\u2019t plan to take any action to stop the publication of the Pentagon Papers once it had begun because the secret history was primarily about Vietnam policy during the Kennedy and Johnson administrations, rather than his own. But Kissinger convinced Nixon that the leak represented a major national security breach and that the president couldn\u2019t ignore it. So Nixon ordered the Justice Department to seek a court-ordered injunction against further publication by the Times. On June 14, 1971, the day after the Times began publishing the papers, Nixon\u2019s Attorney General John Mitchell warned the newspaper to halt further publication of the documents. The Times refused, and the government obtained an injunction. Ellsberg went into hiding, while a small team of his supporters, led by historian Gar Alperovitz, to covertly get copies of the Pentagon Papers to the Washington Post, which was then hit with an injunction as well. Ellsberg then directed the team to get more documents to an expanding list of other newspapers to try to continue their publication. In the process, they were creating their own version of the internet, trying to make the documents so widely available that the court injunctions would be moot. On June 28, Ellsberg turned himself in to face charges in connection with the leak, making him the public face of the Pentagon Papers. He was mobbed by reporters in Boston and suddenly became one of the most famous people in America. Two days later, the Supreme Court, in a landmark decision, lifted the government\u2019s injunction against further publication by the Times and the Post. For Nixon, the aftereffects of the Pentagon Papers case continued to reverberate. The president became obsessed with leaks and created the infamous White House Plumbers to go after them. In September 1971, the Plumbers broke into the office of Ellsberg\u2019s psychiatrist in Los Angeles to search for material they could use to smear him. The burglary was a precursor to the Watergate break-in a year later, which was also conducted by the White House Plumbers and which led to Nixon\u2019s downfall. In May 1973, the judge in Ellsberg\u2019s trial in Los Angeles dismissed the government\u2019s case against him after the Justice Department turned over a memo written by the Watergate special prosecutor disclosing the burglary of Ellsberg\u2019s psychiatrist\u2019s office. (Ironically, Ellsberg learned some of the details of Sheehan\u2019s betrayal during his trial, when Ellsberg\u2019s lawyers obtained notes written by White House Plumber E. Howard Hunt showing that Sheehan and his wife had checked into Cambridge hotels under assumed names and taken the Pentagon Papers to copy shops in Boston and Medford, Massachusetts. The White House Plumbers clearly knew more about what Sheehan was doing than did Ellsberg, who later wrote about Hunt\u2019s notes in his 2002 memoir, \u201cSecrets.\u201d) The Nixon administration\u2019s obsession with Ellsberg \u2014 whom Kissinger called \u201cthe most dangerous man in America\u201d \u2014 turned Ellsberg into an international icon. His fame lasted the rest of his life, long after the secrets revealed in the Pentagon Papers had faded from memory. Ellsberg waited many years to talk publicly about his relationship with the Times, and even then, he only rarely expressed bitterness toward Sheehan and the newspaper. After all, the Times had ultimately published the Pentagon Papers, which is what Ellsberg wanted. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to make the Times my enemy,\u201d he said. In fact, he said that after the Pentagon Papers, he eventually reconciled with Sheehan and agreed to be interviewed for his book, \u201cA Bright Shining Lie.\u201d Susan Sheehan said in an interview that over the years after the Pentagon Papers were published, she and her husband developed a good relationship with Ellsberg and his wife. The Times won the Pulitzer Prize for public service for publishing the Pentagon Papers, but the paper still quietly resented the fact that Ellsberg had garnered so much attention for his role in making the secret history public. Ellsberg said that a Times reporter once told him told him that Abe Rosenthal, the newspaper\u2019s managing editor when the Pentagon Papers were published and later its executive editor, hated Ellsberg. (Rosenthal died in 2006.) \u201cWhy would he hate me?\u201d Ellsberg asked. \u201cBecause you took the story away from the Times,\u201d the reporter replied. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just the Times, it was Ellsberg.\u201d Deconstructed Podcast Deconstructed Vincent Bevins discusses his new book, \u201cIf We Burn: The Mass Protest Decade and the Missing Revolution,\u201d and the global protest movements of the 2010s.

    "content": "A s a candidate in the 2020 election, Joe Biden assailed Donald Trump over what he cast as his rival\u2019s ineffective and un-American approach to immigration \u2013 one that undermined the nation\u2019s long history of welcoming those seeking refuge in the United States. Now as president, facing a migrant crisis that is straining resources at the border and feeding into major US cities, Biden has taken a series of steps that critics on his left say are hardly distinguishable from his predecessor. AOC slams sanctions against Venezuela and deportation flights Read more This week, the Biden administration announced that it will waive a series of federal laws to expedite construction of new barriers along the southern border with Mexico and, separately, resume deportation flights to Venezuela . The actions represent a striking reversal for a president who stopped construction of the border wall on the first day of his administration, after promising on the campaign trail that there would \u201cnot be another foot\u201d built on his watch. Biden insisted on Thursday that the move did not reflect a change of position and were simply appropriated funds being spent as they were allocated. Yet they underscore the complex political landscape the president faces in confronting this crisis ahead of next year\u2019s presidential election, with humanitarian disasters across the globe driving more people to the US\u2019s borders. As Biden\u2019s challenges at the border deepen, Republicans are intensifying their efforts to put immigration at the center of the political debate in 2024. Republicans believe immigration and border security are among the president\u2019s biggest political vulnerabilities. According to the latest NBC News poll , voters also give Republicans the overwhelming advantage on the question of which party is better equipped to handle immigration, a margin that has doubled since Biden\u2019s first year in office. But the issue has also created a wedge between the administration and some of Biden\u2019s staunchest allies. Democratic leaders in New York, Illinois and elsewhere have publicly expressed their dissatisfaction with the administration\u2019s handling of the situation, bluntly accusing the federal government of doing too little to address the increase of migrants in their states. \u201cThere is much more that can and must be done on a federal level to address a national humanitarian crisis that is currently being shouldered by state and local governments without support,\u201d the Illinois governor JB Pritzker wrote in an open letter to the president. Pritzker declared the situation in his state \u201cuntenable\u201d as officials strain to house and feed the influx of migrants. New York City mayor Eric Adams, in an interview with Semafor this week, said the White House was \u201cwrong on immigration,\u201d continuing his sharp public criticism of the federal response. Blue-state leaders had also urged the administration to expand protections for Venezuelans, arguing that it would ease the burden on shelters by making it easier for them to live and work in the US. And, as part of his response, last month the Biden administration announced it would extend temporary protected status (TPS) to nearly a half-million Venezuelans currently in the US. The surge of migrants has been fueled in part by Venezuelans fleeing political upheaval and economic hardship. In September, a monthly record 50,000 Venezuelans crossed the US southern border. The move was roundly welcomed by blue-state leaders and immigration advocates, who had been pushing the administration to extend protections to Venezuelans for more than a year. But when the Biden administration announced on Thursday it would resume deportations of Venezuelans who enter the US unlawfully, advocates were outraged. \u201cThis decision further exposes troubling policy inconsistencies from the administration,\u201d Krish O\u2019Mara Vignarajah, president of Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service, said in a statement . She added: \u201cWhile the challenge of managing migration is very complex, this administration continues to lean too heavily on the stick over the carrot.\u201d Immigration and border security have bedeviled the past several administrations. Efforts to reform the nation\u2019s outdated immigration system have repeatedly faltered in a divided Congress, even as both sides claim it as a priority. Instead, pressure has grown on the executive branch to act unilaterally. Biden insists he has tried. On the day he took office, he proposed legislation that would provide a path to citizenship for an estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants and expand visa eligibility for workers and families. But it has gone nowhere in the face of Republican opposition. Meanwhile, conservative judges, taking up challenges brought by Republicans officials, have thwarted a number of the administration\u2019s immigration efforts. On Thursday, Biden defended the decision by his administration to build additional barriers along the border with Mexico, doubling down on the idea that he had no choice but to allow construction after Congress appropriated the funds in 2019, when Trump was president. Yet by waiving 26 federal laws to allow construction along sections of the border wall in south Texas, critics say he helped to expedite a project at the heart of his predecessor\u2019s immigration legacy. Asked by a reporter whether he had changed his mind that border walls work, Biden said on Thursday that he had not. Conservatives were quick to mock the president for building a wall he didn\u2019t believe would be effective, while immigration advocates decried the president\u2019s actions as an attempt to insulate him from political attacks. In a statement, Jonathan Blazer, director of border strategies at the American Civil Liberties Union, called Biden\u2019s decision to extend the border wall a \u201cprofound failure\u201d. \u201cThis politically motivated action will only harm border communities,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s time for the Biden administration to choose humanity and real solutions over politics.\u201d",

    "content": "\u201cD emocrats in disarray\u201d has been an oft-repeated joke in Washington in recent years, a tongue-in-cheek reference to the tensions that repeatedly flared up between the progressives and the centrists of Joe Biden\u2019s party. But on Tuesday, House Democrats presented a united front as their Republican counterparts turned against each other and ultimately ousted one of their own in a historic defeat. The entire House Democratic caucus voted unanimously to remove the Republican Kevin McCarthy as speaker on Tuesday, joining eight mostly hard-right lawmakers in supporting a motion to vacate the chair. Refusing to intervene in a mess of Republicans\u2019 own making, Democrats looked on as McCarthy was unseated, making him the first House speaker in US history to be removed from office. Under the oversight of their new leader, Hakeem Jeffries of New York, House Democrats have marched in lockstep to challenge Republicans\u2019 policy agenda, offering a stark contrast to the fractious conference that McCarthy tried and failed to unify. As they look to take back the House next year, Democrats hope to use the instability displayed this week to make a broader argument about the extremism that they say has come to define the modern Republican party. Heading into the Tuesday vote, speculation abounded over whether McCarthy might offer Democrats some kind of deal to help save his speakership. But McCarthy chose not to, telling CNBC on Tuesday: \u201cThey haven\u2019t asked for anything, and I\u2019m not going to provide anything.\u201d Instead, McCarthy tried to appeal to members\u2019 faith in the integrity of the House to keep his gavel, arguing that a removal of a speaker would represent an irreversible black mark on the institution. Kevin McCarthy was voted out of his job as speaker on Tuesday. Photograph: J Scott Applewhite/AP But that argument struck many Democrats as hypocritical coming from McCarthy, particularly given the speaker\u2019s stunning flip-flop regarding the deadly insurrection at the Capitol on 6 January 2021. In the days after the attack, McCarthy said Donald Trump \u201cbears responsibility\u201d for the violence carried out by a group of the former president\u2019s supporters. But just two weeks later, McCarthy flew to Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida to make amends, and he later denounced the work of the House select committee investigating the insurrection. McCarthy \u201cwent to Mar-a-Lago to kiss the ring and voted not to impeach Donald Trump for inciting a violent insurrection against the 2020 presidential election and our government\u201d, Jamie Raskin, a Democratic member of the select committee, said Tuesday. \u201cThis is a somber day for America as the chickens come home to roost for Kevin McCarthy.\u201d The final self-inflicted nail in McCarthy\u2019s coffin came on Sunday, the day after the House passed a continuing resolution to extend government funding through 17 November and avert a federal shutdown. House Democrats overwhelmingly supported the stopgap funding bill, with just one member voting against it, but 90 House Republicans opposed the legislation. Donald Trump backs hard-right loyalist Jim Jordan for House speaker Read more And yet, when McCarthy appeared on CBS News\u2019 Face the Nation on Sunday, he attempted to blame Democrats for the last-minute scramble. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure it was going to pass. You want to know why? Because the Democrats tried to do everything they can not to let it pass,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cThey did not want the bill. They were willing to let government shut down, for our military not to be paid.\u201d House Democratic leaders played a clip of McCarthy\u2019s interview during their Tuesday morning caucus meeting, just hours before the chamber\u2019s vote on removing the speaker. McCarthy\u2019s comments outraged Democrats, fortifying the caucus\u2019s resolve to support the motion to vacate. \u201cIt goes in political 101 textbooks going forward as maybe one of the most \u2026 stupid things somebody could do on the eve of your survival vote,\u201d Gerry Connolly, a Democratic Virginia congressman, told NBC News . In the end, every present House Democrat voted to oust McCarthy, ensuring the end of his speakership. Democrats commended Jeffries on keeping his members unified on Tuesday, mirroring the caucus\u2019s unanimous support for Jeffries through 15 rounds of voting during the speakership election in January. \u201cYesterday was a pure demonstration of the type of leadership and continuity that [Jeffries] brings to the table and how inclusive he is,\u201d said Antjuan Seawright, a Democratic strategist. \u201cHe has, I think, been extra intentional about keeping all four corners of the House Democratic caucus square together and living out what diversity and inclusion means when it comes to House Democrats.\u201d Jeffries has now called on more centrist members of the House Republican conference to join Democrats in forming a \u201cbipartisan governing coalition\u201d. The Democratic representative Dean Phillips leaves the Capitol on 29 September. Photograph: Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images \u201cAt this point, we simply need Republican partners willing to break with Maga extremism, reform the highly partisan House rules that were adopted at the beginning of this Congress and join us in finding common ground for the people,\u201d he wrote in a Washington Post op-ed published on Friday. So far, Republican partners have been difficult to find. Some of McCarthy\u2019s allies blamed House Democrats for the speaker\u2019s removal, accusing them of prioritizing their political goals over the good of the country. Democrats have scoffed at that argument, asserting that McCarthy brought about his own downfall by trying to appease the hard-right members who ultimately ousted him. McCarthy only won the speakership in January by making concessions to hard-right lawmakers, including a rule allowing any single member to introduce a motion to vacate the chair. That decision came back to haunt McCarthy this week. \u201cThe same rightwing extremism that gave McCarthy the speakership was the same rightwing extremism that took away his speakership,\u201d Seawright said. \u201cHouse Democrats should continue to draw the contrast with extremism that has hijacked and pretty much taken over the Republican conference with the comparison and the contrast of what was able to be done\u201d when the Democrats had the House majority. Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, suggested the speakership debacle could be a launchpad for Democrats to engage in a fuller discussion about rightwing extremism. With government funding due to run out in just a month, Green said it was urgent for Democrats to make a policy-based pitch against Republicans\u2019 legislative agenda. \u201cExtremism doesn\u2019t just mean they can\u2019t rally their caucus on the House floor. Extremism means they would actually cut social security benefits for millions of current and future seniors,\u201d Green said. \u201cThe extremists within an already extreme Republican party that are in charge are the same ones who would be most likely to use their leverage to cut programs like social security.\u201d As the House prepares for another speakership election, much of the conversation in Washington has focused on who might replace McCarthy. But for Green, the more important conversation involves how the new Republican speaker will govern with a newly emboldened hard-right faction in his conference. Steve Scalise and Jim Jordan, two speaker candidates, have also backed drastic government funding cuts, voting in favor of McCarthy\u2019s recent failed proposal to temporarily reduce most government agencies\u2019 budgets by up to 30%. \u201cI think it\u2019s important to connect the dots between the chaos and extremism we\u2019ve seen playing out in this leadership fight and what those same forces will attempt to do in the upcoming government funding fight,\u201d Green said. \u201cIt\u2019s very possible that members of the public perceive these as two very different stories, as opposed to two chapters in the same story.\u201d",

    "description": "Spain, Portugal and Morocco will host the 2030 World Cup, and talks are ongoing over where the final of the tournament will be held, with Madrid and Casablanca competing.",
    "content": "Forbes Business SportsMoney The Battle To Host The 2030 World Cup Final Heats Up Sam Leveridge Contributor Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own. I am a sports journalist interested in soccer living in Spain. Following Oct 7, 2023, 06:30am EDT | Press play to listen to this article! Got it! Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin The Estadio Santiago Bernab\u00e9u is one of the leading candidates to host the final. Europa Press via Getty Images Following the news that Spain, Portugal and Morocco will be the only bid to host the 2030 World Cup, attentions have turned to who will host the major event in the form of the tournament\u2019s final. There was also the unexpected news that three of the opening games will be played in South America, across Uruguay, Argentina and Paraguay, to honor the tournament\u2019s centenary year. While FIFA have clarified that the opening match will be played in one of the three host countries, it has also sparked a battle between the three to hold the final. Talks are expected to follow later in October, with Moroccan officials confirming a meeter will take place to discuss scheduling on October 18, which could include discussions regarding the host for the final. The host city for the 2026 World Cup final, hosted across the United States, Canada and Mexico, is also yet to be confirmed, and the 2030 tournament poses similar questions with the competition again split across three nations. Morocco have the chance to host a second World Cup final in Africa, while Spain or Portugal could become the first European nation to host the occasion since the Olympiastadion in Berlin, Germany, in 2006.

WWE SmackDown Results: Winners And Grades On October 6, 2023 23andMe User Data Stolen And Listed For Sale In Attack Targeting Ashkenazi Jews Estadio Santiago Bernab\u00e9u, Madrid, Spain One of the leading candidates is the jewel in Spanish soccer\u2019s crown, the Estadio Santiago Bernab\u00e9u. Currently undergoing an expansion and modernization project which will take its capacity to over 82,000, the Bernab\u00e9u will likely be the only stadium in the 2030 World Cup with a roof and will also benefit from some of the best corporate hospitality options in the game. The project, led by Real Madrid\u2019s president Florentino P\u00e9rez, has cost an estimated \u20ac893 million ($947 million), and the World Cup final would be seen as the perfect way to celebrate. Building work remains ongoing at present, but is expected to be completed in 2024, with many of the new features already being used this season. In the centre of the Spanish capital of Madrid, the Bernab\u00e9u is not only respected for its history, including hosting the 1982 World Cup final, but also for its state of the art facilities and transport links. The Metro system serves the stadium with its own station, while local and national train links stop nearby and the Adolfo Su\u00e1rez Madrid-Barajas Airport is only a short journey away. That\u2019s in addition to Madrid being one of Europe\u2019s leading hospitality capitals, with experience in hosting major events, including the Champions League final in 2019 and a Copa Libertadores final the same year. Giving his take on the matter, Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti made his stance clear, saying, \u201cthe World Cup final has to be in Madrid, because it\u2019s the capital of Spain, and in the Bernab\u00e9u because it will be the best stadium in the world.\u201d Gran Stade de Casablanca, Morocco The other leading candidate is one which doesn\u2019t yet exist. The proposed Gran State de Casablanca will be purpose built to celebrate the 2030 World Cup with an expected capacity of 93,000, making it one of the tournament\u2019s largest stadiums. The stadium formed part of Morocco\u2019s 2010 World Cup bid and has remained on the table ever since, with the project now expected to be completed and opened in 2025 in time for the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations, which will be hosted by Morocco. The building project is expected to cost around $200 million. Gran Stade de Casablanca is the only one of Morocco\u2019s six arenas put forward for the tournament which is yet to be built, but remains a leading candidate. Casablanca currently hosts the 46,000 capacity Stade Mohammed V, which is home to Raja Casablanca and Wydad Casablanca, two of the biggest teams in Morocco. \"We look forward to an extraordinary final that will honour the whole continent and the younger generation in a stadium in Casablanca that will be extraordinary and wonderful,\u201d Faouzi Lekjaa, president of the Moroccan Football Federation, said, as he continued to push for the African city to host the spectacle. Other options Beyond these two, there is, of course, the possibility of holding the climax tournament in the other host country, Portugal. Portuguese officials have been quiet to date in terms of the final, but their stadiums have frequently been chosen as one of the preferred destinations for major finals of UEFA EFA . In 2020, Lisbon and the Est\u00e1dio da Luz hosted the Champions League final, while a year later it traveled a few hours nothing to the Est\u00e1dio do Drag\u00e3o in Porto. Their capacities, of 66,000 and 50,000 respectively, make them smaller options than their rivals in Spain and Morocco, and may give the other nations an advantage. Even within Spain, there could be competition. While the Bernab\u00e9u is seen as the favourite given its ongoing building work at present and its presence in the capital, the Spotify Camp Nou could also come into contention. Barcelona are currently conducting their own renovation project, at a cost of \u20ac900 million ($954 million), which will take the capacity to 105,000. That would make it the tournament\u2019s biggest arena by some distance, but it does have the handicap of not having hosted a Spanish national team game since 1987, with the exception of the 1992 Olympic Games.

    "description": "Dear Amy: I mow lawns as a side gig.",
    "content": "I mow lawns as a side gig. Several months ago, my lawn mower quit working and one of the people I mow for (the \u201cSmiths\u201d) offered to let me use theirs. I accepted their offer, and told them that as long as I used their lawn mower to mow other lawns, I wouldn\u2019t charge them for mowing theirs. A few weeks ago, another client gave me their old lawn mower (they\u2019d gotten a new one). It was a kind gesture that truly filled my heart with hope. Since then, I have not borrowed the Smith\u2019s mower. I\u2019ve told them that I have a good mower, now. They asked me to continue using theirs on their lawn, and I agreed. Since then, I\u2019ve mowed, weed-whacked and cleaned the grass from their property two times. They thank me and tell me how great it looks \u2026 but they haven\u2019t paid me. I\u2019m trying to figure out a tactful way to ask them for payment. I value them as friends; they\u2019re almost like family. Can you help me to find the words? Judging by my mailbag, the act of asking for money you are owed for services rendered is one of the most uncomfortable situations people face. It is vital for free-lancers (such as yourself) to establish a clear and confident payment policy. The \u201cSmiths\u201d generously let you use their mower to mow their and other clients\u2019 lawns. During that period, you didn\u2019t charge them to mow their lawn. Now that this period has ended, you need to get them back on a payment schedule. Contact them by email to say: \u201cThank you again for lending your mower when I needed it! This generous gesture helped to keep my business going, and I\u2019m very grateful. However, now that I have replaced my mower, I\u2019d like to get you back on a payment schedule. If you\u2019d like me to continue to use your mower for your property, I\u2019d be happy to extend a 20 percent discount [or whatever discount you decide]. With the discount, the fee for your property would be XX for each mowing and weed cleanup. If you don\u2019t want me to use your mower, I\u2019ll use my own. If so, the fee reverts to XX. Please let me know which you would prefer, and we\u2019ll schedule your next mowing. With regards and much gratitude\u2026\u201d The more transparent and professionally you behave in this area of your business, the better it will be for you and your clients. If so, I predict that your business, like the crab grass in my own lawn, will continue to grow. I was on an Alaskan cruise in September. On September 11 the ship made an announcement at about noon that we would have a minute of silence to commemorate 9/11. I was in the dining area. Within a few seconds there was dead silence among the hundreds of people there, many of which were probably not Americans. At the table adjacent to me was a family (who were not speaking English) who continued to talk among themselves. I was tempted to walk over with an image of the World Trade Center on my phone to explain what was going on without speaking. However, I did not do anything but reverently bow my head as the minute passed. They continued to talk during the whole observance. Should I have taken some action? If I was visiting a country where I did not know the language and everyone was suddenly silent I would have followed the crowd and been silent myself. If you are traveling in a country where you don\u2019t speak or understand the language, announcements can sound like white noise. And if you are with other excited people and deeply engaged in conversation, you might not notice that others have fallen silent. I don\u2019t think it was necessary for you to flash a photo of this tragedy in order to drive your point home, but approaching the table, making eye contact, and making the universal symbols for \u201cquiet\u201d and \u201cpraying\u201d might have alerted the group for the need to pay respect. \u201cLost in-law\u201d asked how to refer to his former brother-in-law, who is the father of his niece and nephew. I\u2019ve had that situation for years. My former BIL and I both have kids (who are cousins), so I call him \u201cUncle Norm\u201d and he calls me \u201cUncle Dan.\u201d You nailed it. Great solution!",

    "content": "By A vibrant new mural in celebrates the community\u2019s unique generational strength and diversity. The mural, called \u201cGenerational Spirit,\u201d was unveiled in Central Square on Sept. 27 as the inaugural piece in , a pilot initiative by HarborArts in partnership with East Boston Main Streets. According to its website, the organization\u2019s mission is to \u201cbreathe new life into local communities by strategically placing engaging sculptures, vibrant murals, and interactive artworks in our Main Streets.\u201d The colorful 30-foot-by-40-foot mural was created on the brick wall of the East Boston Social Center at 68 Central Square and depicts three generations \u2014 a girl, a woman, and an older man. According to the organization, the mural will be \u201ca beacon of neighborhood pride,\u201d featuring the work of local artists Silvia Lopez Chavez and Felipe Ortiz. The artists began painting the mural in early September. They say the message behind the piece is a celebration of local diversity and the support system that exists between generations in the community. \u201cEach generation is supporting each other, is proud of who they are and what they bring to the table, and also lifting the future,\u201d Lopez Chavez WGBH, adding that the use of patterns on the mural\u2019s background represents a multitude of cultures.

    "description": "Owner Jeff Nace highlights his top picks from the North End restaurant's menu. The post What to order at Neptune Oyster appeared first on Boston.com.",
    "content": "By Jeff Nace, owner of the North End\u2019s palpable , began our conversation by referring to the iconic Italian neighborhood as \u201cthe belly of Boston.\u201d When he opened the seafood-savvy restaurant on Salem Street in 2004, however, crustaceans and crudo strayed exponentially from the area\u2019s traditional and In fact, that\u2019s how Nace conceptualized the restaurant. He was working in the North End and recalled how tourists would regularly ask him where to eat seafood nearby. Though it was established as a unique concept for the North End, it\u2019s become a neighborhood hotspot for locals and tourists alike. \u201cWe\u2019re respecting the neighborhood while doing our own thing,\u201d Nace said. \u201cI think Boston is the seafood capital of the world, and the North End is the belly of Boston, so we\u2019re in a prime location.\u201d From bluefin crostini to a celebrity-approved Monday night special, here are the can\u2019t-miss menu items at Neptune. There\u2019s no better starting point than with a tray of briny bivalves on the half shell. The oyster shuckers greet guests from their window stations behind the decadent raw bar with no less than 12 varieties on display on any given day \u2014 six of which are always local. \u201cThe oyster farmers come directly to us,\u201d said Nace, noting that many of his trusted purveyors are old friends from Martha\u2019s Vineyard all the way up to Maine. All oysters are served with a champagne ros\u00e9 mignonette made with light champagne vinegar and pink peppercorns, as well as classic cocktail sauce with hot pepper horseradish. A signature on Neptune\u2019s menu, the crudo selection always highlights seasonal seafood, from bluefin tuna to fluke to Nantucket Bay scallops. All come lightly adorned and paired with sea salts from as nearby as Duxbury and as far flung as Iceland or Hawaii. \u201cYou want to taste the fish,\u201d Nace said. \u201cI don\u2019t like to cover it up. To me, that\u2019s like putting a mustache on the .\u201d Though Johnnycakes are more famed in their native Rhode Island, Neptune adds a spin on this cornmeal-based pancake with smoked bluefish tartare, a dollop of caviar, and a drizzle of honey butter. \u201cThis [dish] plays a lot of fiddles,\u201d Nace said. \u201cSometimes people get it as an appetizer. Sometimes we put a candle on it and serve it for someone\u2019s birthday as we don\u2019t have dessert on the menu.\u201d \u201cWhen we opened up, Boston was only a one lobster roll town \u2014 they only served it cold,\u201d said Nace, who grew up in Newburyport where his grandmother made hot buttered lobster rolls. He took a page from his grandmother\u2019s book at Neptune with their wildly popular hot buttered lobster served in a toasted brioche roll from Iggy\u2019s bakery. \u201cI think it\u2019s the best bakery in Boston,\u201d Nace said. The restaurant also serves the traditional cold roll with Maine lobster meat tossed in mayo. Whether hot or cold, there\u2019s always eight ounces of fresh lobster made to order. Neptune runs a daily special seven days a week. On Mondays, it\u2019s always the lobster spaghettini: thin noodles in a garlic, white wine, and tomato sauce, smothered in Maine lobster meat, breadcrumbs, and Parmesan cheese (freshly shaved truffles are available if you\u2019re feeling fancy). Aside from being a fan-favorite among locals, it\u2019s received the Hollywood stamp of approval, Nace said. During filming for \u201cThe Departed,\u201d Nace served it to Leonardo DiCaprio. \u201cHe didn\u2019t say a word for three minutes, then all he said was \u2018wow\u2019 three times,\u201d Nace said. \u201cI wish I had it on film!\u201d Stay up to date on the latest food news from Boston.com.

    "content": "The family of a North Carolina man who drowned last year after he drove off a collapsed bridge while following Google Maps directions has sued Google for negligence, saying that the company\u2019s failure to update its maps led directly to his death. Philip Paxson, 47, a medical device salesperson, was on his way home from his daughter\u2019s camping-themed ninth birthday party in Hickory, North Carolina, on Sept. 30, 2022, navigating a rainy night on unfamiliar roads, when he drove off a collapsed roadway into a creek and drowned, according to the lawsuit, which was filed in Wake County Superior Court on Tuesday. Alicia Paxson, his wife, also sued two businesses and an individual who the lawsuit says owned, controlled or were responsible for the collapsed bridge, which was unmarked, with no barricades. Paxson had taken their two daughters home from the party in her car, while her husband stayed late to clean up and drove separately, she said in an interview. \u201cThis is horrific, what our family is going through,\u201d she said. When she thinks about how easily it could have been prevented, given that people had warned Google about the dangerous route it was suggesting, \u201cit just kills me,\u201d she said. Paxson said she searched her husband\u2019s phone after the accident and found that he had looked up directions home from the party on Google Maps. A Google spokesperson, Jos\u00e9 Casta\u00f1eda, said in a statement that the company, which is owned by Alphabet, had the deepest sympathies for the Paxson family. \u201cOur goal is to provide accurate routing information in Maps, and we are reviewing this lawsuit,\u201d he said. Google Maps has for years directed drivers to cross the bridge, which collapsed in 2013, according to the lawsuit. In November 2020, Google Maps acknowledged receipt of a complaint that a Hickory resident had submitted about the dangerous route recommendation, but it continued to suggest the route, according to the lawsuit. \u201cThis was a crater literally in the middle of a residential neighborhood,\u201d said Robert Zimmerman, a lawyer for Paxson. \u201cIt\u2019d be one thing if it was there for a day or a week, but it was there for nine years.\u201d Nearly a year after Philip Paxson\u2019s death, Zimmerman said, the bridge has not been repaired, and Google Maps is still directing drivers to cross it. Google and the other defendants \u2014 Hinckley Gauvain LLC; Tarde LLC; and James Tarlton, who, according to state records, owns Tarde \u2014 would be served with the lawsuit paperwork in the coming weeks, Zimmerman said. The companies and Tarlton could not immediately be reached, and it was not clear if they had legal representation. Zimmerman said that there was no valid reason for the companies and Tarlton, who were responsible for maintaining the bridge, to have left it in such a dangerous state for so long, with no barricades, warning signs or lighting around it. A spokesperson for the North Carolina Department of Transportation said in an email Thursday that \u201cthe section of road where this incident occurred is owned by a private entity\u201d and that the department \u201chas no legal authority to make improvements to this location.\u201d The lawsuit said that Google Maps and other mapping and navigation platforms had the responsibility to update their maps in a timely manner and to correct routes once they were notified of hazards. The lawsuit raises a question for GPS developers: Who is liable when injuries or fatalities occur because of faulty directions? The question has become particularly relevant for Google Maps, the most popular mapping service in the United States. In 2018, 72% of smartphone users looked up directions on Google Maps, according to Statista, a market insight company. The next most popular app was Waze, which is owned by Google, which was used by 12% of smartphone owners that year. GPS services have come under criticism not just for directing drivers through hazardous routes but also for disorienting hikers. Mountaineering Scotland, a climbing organization, and the John Muir Trust, a charity that maintains natural areas in Britain, have warned that Google Maps may direct hikers to trails that would lead them over cliffs and rocky, steep terrain.",

    "description": "These characters were part of a suite of products that Meta introduced in September -- all powered by artificial intelligence \u2014 and that will soon be found throughout its products.",
    "content": "MENLO PARK, Calif. \u2014 In a WhatsApp text conversation this week, we asked Jane Austen \u2014 yes, the 19th-century British author \u2014 how she felt about Mr. Darcy, a character from one of her most famous works, \u201cPride and Prejudice.\u201d After a few seconds, Austen responded. \u201cAh, Mr. Darcy. Everyone remembers him as one of my characters,\u201d she said, her face appearing in a small window above our conversation. \u201cBut fewer people have read one of my books,\u201d she added, with an arched eyebrow and what seemed like a hint of resentment. Austen was not talking to us. But a modern interpretation of her likeness was used by Meta, which owns WhatsApp, Facebook and Instagram, as part of an artificially intelligent character that could chat across the company\u2019s messaging apps. Characters based on other people\u2019s likenesses \u2014 including former quarterback Tom Brady, social media influencers Beast and Charlie D\u2019Amelio, and hip-hop artist Snoop Dogg \u2014 were also available to converse. These characters were part of a suite of products that Meta introduced in September \u2014 all powered by artificial intelligence \u2014 and that will soon be found throughout its products, including Instagram, Messenger, and virtual- and augmented-reality devices like the Quest 3 headset and Ray-Ban Stories smart glasses. The rollout also includes a chatbot that will be powered partly by Microsoft\u2019s Bing search engine, as well as AI-assisted image-editing tools to use on Instagram. \u201cMost people haven\u2019t had the chance to experience\u201d the newest and most powerful AI technologies, Mark Zuckerberg, Meta\u2019s CEO, said Wednesday. \u201cThat\u2019s a thing that I think we can change.\u201d He added, \u201cPeople aren\u2019t going to want to interact with one single super intelligent AI \u2014 people will want to interact with a bunch of different ones.\u201d Meta is aiming to keep pace with OpenAI, Google, Microsoft and other companies in the frenzied race over AI that can instantly generate text, images and other media on its own. Since November, when OpenAI unexpectedly launched the chatbot ChatGPT, Silicon Valley executives have embraced the technology as the next big shift in computing \u2014 and struggled not to be left behind. For Meta, widespread acceptance of its new AI products could significantly increase engagement across its many apps, most of which rely on advertising to make money. More time spent in Meta\u2019s apps means more ads shown to its users. While Meta has worked on AI behind the scenes for years, it was initially slow to introduce products with generative AI, especially as it focused on transforming into a metaverse company. To catch up, Zuckerberg overhauled the company to focus on building AI-focused products like the ones introduced Wednesday, holding weekly meetings with his executive team to discuss the progress. Now Meta is using its tried-and-true playbook of leveraging its enormous size \u2014 globally, more than 3 billion people use its products \u2014 to popularize its offerings. And whereas interactions with ChatGPT and Google\u2019s Bard chatbot have largely been between an individual and the bot or within productivity programs like Gmail, Zuckerberg envisions users of Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp interacting with chatbots more socially in their everyday conversations and group chats with friends. For example: If two friends chatting on WhatsApp want to find a good breakfast spot in San Francisco on Sunday morning, they might naturally turn to Meta\u2019s new chatbot, Meta AI, to ask, \u201cWhere is the best place for eggs Benedict in San Francisco?\u201d Within a few seconds, Meta\u2019s digital assistant would mine Microsoft\u2019s Bing search engine for real-time web results, and use its underlying AI to spit out a short, conversational response. (People who want more specific information can click on linked footnotes in the response, which would redirect them to Bing search results in another window.) Other social networking apps have also started weaving in AI abilities. Snap added a chatbot this year to its social media service, Snapchat, which is popular among teenagers. Its chatbot is embodied by a digital avatar that users can rename and customize. And Character.AI, a Silicon Valley startup, offers a service in which people can chat with a reasonable facsimile of almost anyone, living or dead. Meta\u2019s new character-like bots work similarly to Snapchat\u2019s offering \u2014 and a little like the digital personalities offered by Character.AI. One Meta AI character \u2014 Amber, modeled after Paris Hilton \u2014 plays a detective partner for \u201csolving whodunits\u201d in chats. Kendall Jenner\u2019s character, called Billie, is described as a \u201cNo BS, ride-or-die companion.\u201d Tennis star Naomi Osaka\u2019s character, Tamika, is an \u201canime-obsessed Sailor Senshi in training,\u201d while Snoop Dogg plays a Dungeon Master in a sendup of Dungeons and Dragons with a \u201cchoose your own adventure\u201d type of experience. The celebrities and athletes are being paid for their AI characters; Meta did not provide details on compensation. The characters are a way for people to have fun, learn things, talk recipes or just pass the time \u2014 all within the context of connecting with friends and family, company executives said. \u201cWe see people going to different AIs for different things, which is how we see ourselves building out an ecosystem of many more AIs over time,\u201d said Ahmad Al-Dahle, Meta\u2019s vice president of generative AI. But like other chatbots, Meta\u2019s chatbots can generate false and misleading information \u2014 a phenomenon that researchers call hallucination. This can happen even when the bot bases its answer on what it grabs from a search engine. When we asked the Meta AI assistant, \u201cWho won the 1904 World Series?,\u201d it incorrectly said \u201cthe New York Giants\u201d and asked if it could help with anything else. When we then asked if the World Series was even played in 1904, the bot adjusted and correctly said there was no 1904 World Series because the Giants refused to play. Like Microsoft, OpenAI and others, Meta is also offering a tool for instantly generating photorealistic images. Users will be able to instantly create AI-produced photos or sticker emoji reactions inside the company\u2019s messaging apps based on whatever they type into the chat prompt, with some limitations. This kind of image-generating technology can be used to spread disinformation online. To guard against this possibility, Meta said, images created with the tool will be marked with an icon indicating they were created by AI. Al-Dahle said Meta had spent thousands of hours doing \u201cred team\u201d scenarios to test the potential misuse of the technologies. The company has also published a set of responsible-use guidelines for those who want to use Meta\u2019s underlying technology to eventually power their own chatbots. Many of the products will also be rolled out in a limited capacity to U.S. users only, as the company works out any early kinks and watches how users respond. A future with legions of chatbots could be closer than we might think. Meta\u2019s public release in July of LLaMA 2 \u2014 the code behind its latest and most advanced AI technology \u2014 was enthusiastically greeted by developers and has been downloaded more than 30 million times. Meta is working with Microsoft, Google and Amazon\u2019s cloud services divisions to host the technology for developers who want to create the next generation of bots that can do whatever the coders want them to do \u2014 for better or worse. For now, the AI-powered Austen would say only so much. When we asked at what age a woman should marry, she refused to answer. \u201cMy goodness, you want me to dictate your love life?\u201d she said. \u201cMarry whenever you find someone who can tolerate your eccentricities. And you theirs.\u201d This article originally appeared in .",
