[+] in the UEFA Euro 2020 Championship Final between Italy and England at Wembley Stadium on July 11, 2021 in London, England. (Photo by Andy Rain - Pool/Getty Images) Getty Images Teams hoping to win the World Cup not only have to beat their opponents, they need to beat the local climate and conditions. Games played at altitude, in soaring temperatures, or with huge distances between venues can make or break a team\u2019s tournament. At the 2014 World Cup, an energy-sapping encounter in Manaus, deep in the hot and humid Amazon basin, exhausted England and Italy\u2019s players, and was partially blamed for both countries\u2019 group-stage exits. Many of these challenges are caused simply by the diverse nature of our planet. But for the 2030 World Cup, FIFA has skewed the field for its own political reasons. Reports suggest that the 2030 World Cup will be hosted in Spain, Portugal and Morocco, but with the opening three matches played across the ocean in South America. Uruguay, Paraguay and Argentina had bid for the 2030 tournament, with a main focus of their bid being that it would be 100 years since the first World Cup in Uruguay, so it would be nice and sentimental to host the centenary event there too (despite most of the games being in neighboring Argentina). In some feat of sporting diplomacy, it seems the bulk of the 2030 tournament will now be played in Europe and North Africa, with the opening three games being played in Uruguay, Paraguay and Argentina to reflect this centenary year.

Local South Americans will be unlikely to get any tickets despite \u201chosting\u201d a World Cup, national team fans will have to add a transatlantic ticket to their World Cup expenses, and while Infantino says 2030 \u201cwill have a unique global footprint,\u201d it seems he hasn\u2019t considered the tournament\u2019s carbon footprint . The decision to host the opening three games in South America could also impact the sporting integrity of the tournament. Buenos Aires is more than 10,000 kilometers, or a 12-hour flight, from Madrid. That\u2019s more than double the distance between 2026 host cities Vancouver and Miami, and more than three times the distance between the two furthest apart cities at Russia 2018. While Madrid and Morocco could be in the middle of summer heatwaves during the World Cup, it will be winter in Buenos Aires with the daily mean temperature in June just 12 degrees Celsius (53 degrees Fahrenheit), and there is a six-hour time difference between Paraguay and Spain. The effect of travel on performance can be seen at Euro 2020 , which was held across Europe and had huge disparities between distances traveled, with some countries potentially traveling more than ten times further than others. Out of all the teams to reach the knockout stages, the two finalists, England and Italy, had the shortest total distance from their opening game to the final. Semi-finalists Denmark had the second shortest distance to travel up to the round of 16, where they won 4-0 against Wales, who had the fifth longest distance at that stage. The other semi-finalist, Spain, had the fifth shortest route to the final. And in the three-day turnaround between the quarterfinals and semifinals, the two losers of the semifinals had much longer journeys to London from Baku and Saint Petersburg. Correlation might not be causation, but there is certainly some correlation between the distances traveled and results during Euro 2020. Overcoming the local conditions is part of tournament soccer. As far back as the Mexico 1986 World Cup, England trained in steam rooms at altitude in Colorado to try to prepare for with the altitude of Mexico City and extreme heat of Monterrey. But depending on the fixture schedule, six teams at the 2030 World Cup could possibly have to travel an extra 10,000 miles more than their next opponents. They will also need to find two base camps, disrupting their tournament preparations. Whether it shows in the next game, or through accumulated fatigue as the tournament progresses, these kinds of factors can make the difference between winning and losing. Follow me on Twitter .

    "content": "People who seek help for mental health issues should be asked about problem gambling in the same way they are asked about drugs, smoking and alcohol, new guidance has suggested. According to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice), those who visit an NHS health professional in England for depression, anxiety or thoughts about self-harm or suicide due to a possible addiction, such as alcohol or drugs, could be at a greater risk of harm from gambling. Nice said questions should be asked about patients\u2019 gambling habits to ensure they can cope with their thoughts and urges. In new draft guidance, it suggested patients should be encouraged to assess the severity of their gambling by using a questionnaire available on the NHS website. Those who score eight or higher should seek support and treatment from gambling services. Health professionals should also discuss software blocking tools to limit online gambling and consider cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) as an option. NHS England has said about 1,400 people were referred for help for gambling addiction last year, up by a third on 2021. Prof Jonathan Benger, the chief medical officer and interim director of the centre for guidelines at Nice, said: \u201cHarmful gambling causes immense misery to all those who experience it. We want those needing help or who are at risk to be identified sooner and receive appropriate help.\u201d Since 2019, NHS England has opened 12 gambling treatment clinics, with a further three due to open in the coming months. It is planning to treat up to 3,000 people a year across the 15 facilities, as part of the NHS long-term plan. Benger added: \u201cThe independent committee who made these draft recommendations included both clinicians and people with personal experience of harmful gambling. They scrutinised all the available evidence to identify treatments and therapies that have been shown to work and offer good value for money. The result is this useful and usable advice to help NHS clinics as they develop their service.\u201d Fiona Macleod, the director of services at the charity GamCare, said the Nice guidance was \u201can important step\u201d. \u201cIdentifying an issue with gambling as early as possible is vital to prevent harm from occurring later down the line, and we know that there is an important role that healthcare professionals can play in helping more people find the support they need. \u201cWe believe these recommendations, if implemented, will present a greater opportunity to prevent gambling harms from occurring in the UK. They represent an important step in encouraging more people to seek support, through services such as those GamCare provides.\u201d Zo\u00eb Osmond, the chief executive of GambleAware, also welcomed the draft guidance. \u201cGambling harms are a serious public health issue, which can affect anyone, and healthcare professionals are ideally placed to identify and help people experiencing them,\u201d she said. \u201cWe welcome the development of guidelines to further inform treatment for those seriously affected by gambling harm and will be responding to the consultation with our views.\u201d The NHS England mental health director, Claire Murdoch, said: \u201cGambling addiction is a cruel disease that destroys people\u2019s lives, and the NHS is already playing its part in treating it with four new specialist clinics opening in recent months and a further three opening later this year, so if you\u2019re struggling, please come forward for help. \u201cWe will work with Nice on this consultation process and while this new guidance will ensure the NHS can help even more people struggling with gambling addiction to receive evidenced-based treatment, it is vital that the billion-pound industry also takes action in line with the government\u2019s white paper to stop people coming to harm in the first place.\u201d In April, the government outlined plans to reform gambling to ensure regulation meets new challenges as the \u201clandscape has changed significantly since 2005\u201d.

Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin The cricket World Cup starts on October 5 (Photo by Matthew Lewis-ICC/ICC via Getty Images) ICC via Getty Images The cricket World Cup starts on October 5 in the sport's rabid heartland. India which famously last hosted the event in 2011 when a MS Dhoni title-clinching six into a sea of ecstatic fans became instantly etched into lore. Even though T20s had been around for some time, with two T20 World Cups contested and the Indian Premier League exploding onto the scene in 2008, the most important prize was undoubtedly the World Cup of the 50-over variety. Back then there was no need to differentiate. The World Cup was the World Cup. The T20 equivalent was a little bit mickey mouse at the international level, still not taken seriously. But things have changed significantly in the last 12 years. The shorter three-hour format of T20 has grabbed the hearts of a younger generation, spawning lucrative domestic leagues globally, and proving a suitable game for this instant gratification era. Last year's T20 World Cup , marked by an epic India-Pakistan contest at a 90,000 MCG, felt like the tournament had really arrived. And the next event - just eight months away - might be a definitive moment for the sport with it being co-hosted by the U.S. Kohli inspired India to an amazing victory over arch-rivals Pakistan (Photo by Daniel ...

There has been much debate over the future of the 50-over format - which is played over around eight hours - and whether it should be significantly reduced or ditched entirely. As I reported recently, ODI's immediate future is secure with cricket's powerbrokers intent on protecting the format. ODIs still holds significant cache because of the 50-over World Cup, which is a money-spinner and remains the most coveted prize for players. It won't be going anywhere because there are World Cups in the next cycle of events in 2027 and 2031. For the next event, which will be played in South Africa, Zimbabwe and Namibia, the World Cup will finally expand from its measly number of 10 teams to 14. That means smaller cricket nations will need more exposure beforehand to ensure they are competitive for the next World Cup. But amid such a crammed calendar, with ODIs seemingly the casualty, there will be precious opportunities for them. With seemingly little appetite, despite administrators saying otherwise, the format is clearly on the nose, played less these days with little fanfare from fans. It's saddening for a previous generation when the 50-over format was the most exciting spectacle imaginable. ODI cricket once attracted packed crowds (Photo by Tony Marshall/EMPICS via Getty Images) PA Images via Getty Images There have already been reports from India that this cricket-mad country has been less enthused over the World Cup. Sports fever is currently centered over India's strong showing at the Asian Games - the world's second biggest multi-sport event being contested in Hangzhou, China. Inevitably, especially if hosts and favorites India start getting on a roll, the World Cup will ignite and it could lead to a swirl of nostalgia. Maybe fans will believe the format can offer the right balance of Test cricket's slow burn along with T20's manic approach. Or perhaps this will be something of a last dance, where the often excruciating middle overs makes everyone realise that the format is a relic. Either way, 50-over cricket will be the center of attention in the cricket world. Something that rarely happens these days. Follow me on Twitter .

File Photo: Commander, US President Joe Biden and US First Lady Jill Bidens German Shepherd, is ... [+] taken for a walk on the South Lawn before their return to the White House in Washington, DC. AFP via Getty Images Key Facts The First Lady\u2019s spokesperson said Commander \u201cis not presently on the White House campus while next steps are evaluated,\u201d the Associated Press reported . The spokesperson noted that the Bidens are \u201cgrateful for the patience and support\u201d of the Secret Service staffers and all other staffers as they attempt to \u201cwork through solutions.\u201d Last month, a tourist took a photo of Commander biting Dale Haney, the White House\u2019s chief groundskeeper and later that month the dog bit a Secret Service officer. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre commented on the photo of Commander biting Haney and said the dog and the chief groundskeeper were playing and no skin was broken at the time. What To Watch For It is unclear where the 2-year-old German shepherd is living currently and if there are plans to bring him back to the White House. The First Lady\u2019s spokesperson said the White House can be a \u201cstressful environment\u201d for pets and the family was working on \u201cways to help Commander handle the often unpredictable nature of the White House grounds.\u201d Key Background Aside from the two biting incidents reported last month, the 2-year-old German shepherd has bitten Secret Service personnel at least 10 other times , according to the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s records. The ten earlier biting incidents were recorded between October 2022 and January 2023, one of which required a hospital visit. It is unknown if any other biting incidents have taken place between January and September. Biden\u2019s older German Shepherd Major was also involved in several biting incidents, which eventually resulted in him moving out of the White House. Tangent CNN reported that Secret Service personnel at the White House had raised concerns about workplace safety over the biting incidents. One source cited by CNN referred to the work environment as \u201chostile\u201d and \u201cdangerous\u201d adding that agents are forced to avoid some entrances and routes inside the building to avoid getting bitten by Commander. Despite purportedly receiving assurances that the dog would receive appropriate training, the incidents continued to happen.

Sophomore wing Joseph Pinion led six Red players in double figures with a game-high 20 points (7-of-8 field goals, including 3-of-4 from 3, and 3-of-4 free throws) to go with 4 rebounds, 1 assist, 1 steal, and boxscore plus-13 in 27 minutes as his team broke a 41-all tie at halftime to topple the White, 88-70, in front of a hearty crowd of nearly 5,500 inside the venue that the men\u2019s and women\u2019s basketball teams called home through the 1992-93 season. Seven different Hogs hit three\u2019s as the teams combined for 14-of-28 shooting from distance (50%). \u201cFirst of all, the crowd was awesome,\u201d Head Hog Eric Musselman said after the game. \u201cIt was closer to 6,000 than 5,500. So the turnout when the weather\u2019s not great, and we\u2019re still a long way from playing a game. So I thought the crowd was awesome. \u201cI think the guys felt that, even pregame. A lot of things we need to clean up, we need to get better. But all things that we think are teachable. The shooting is obviously \u2026 We\u2019re going to be able to stretch the defense out a little bit more than maybe we have in the past. So really pleased with our shooting. Pretty pleased wit how the flow of the offense is. We\u2019re running an offense that we ran for about 10 games two years ago that\u2019s kind of what Milwaukee ran two years ago. And it requires a lot of thinking and a lot of reading and pretty happy with how far advanced the guys are with that. Obviously we\u2019ve got to get a lot, lot better. Some guys are further advanced on knowing this than others, but that\u2019ll hopefully come over time.\u201d Senior lead guard El Ellis had a strong floor game for the Red with his 16 points (8-10 field goals), game-high 6 assists, 1 steal, 1 turnover, and boxscore plus-17 in 28 minutes.

The Red team shot a blistering 37-of-54 from the field (68.5%), including 6-of-11 from 3 (54.5%), and 8-of-11 at the free throw line (72.7%). The Red dominated the glass (plus-10 at 27-17) and turnovers [plus-6 at 13-7, including plus-7 in steals at 10-3). The White team shot 26-of-47 from the field (55.3%), including 8-of-17 from 3 (47.1%), and 10-of-15 from the foul line (66.7%). It seemed unlikely that Brazile would play given what Musselman told the media following practice on Thursday, Sept. 28, which was Brazile (he\u2019s completing recovery on his injured knee that ended his season nearly a year ago in early December 2022) would likely begin competing in live, full-contact scrimmaging in \u201ctwo-and-a-half weeks.\u201d Indeed, Brazile was not included on either roster for the Red/White tilt. Musselman updated Brazile\u2019s status following the Red/White game. \u201cWith TB, we\u2019re being \u2014 like, I want TB in March,\u201d Musselman said. \u201cI mean, we want him to get his rhythm and all that. He\u2019s done an awesome job. He\u2019s been cleared. He\u2019s been with his rehab guy. They\u2019ve done all the testing. Everything is great. Probably could\u2019ve played tonight, three minutes a half, but why? \u201cWe want him to go a little more three-on-three. He\u2019s been going three-on-three live after we\u2019re done with practice. So, he\u2019ll go three-on-three live one more time this week at some point. But he\u2019s been jumping into all of our drills. Offensively, when a player is coming back from an injury like that, that\u2019s not really an issue. The issue is, \u2018I\u2019m guarding you or you or you and I got to react.\u2019 And so that\u2019s why we want to take our time. No real timeline other than we certainly \u2014 with the way it\u2019s going now, he\u2019s playing opening night.\u201d Junior guard Khalif Battle went through early pre-game warmups, but left the court appearing to favor his right foot. When he returned to the court, he was in street clothes and on crutches with his foot in a walking boot. Musselman also addressed Battle\u2019s injury status after the game. \u201cHe practiced today,\u201d Musselman said of Battle. \u201cI walked over and got in the gym and he said his foot was really sore. They took him for a preliminary look over at the football facility. At that point, nothing, there was no determination there was anything, no break or anything. But I know that they\u2019re going to look at it again tomorrow with some different X-rays or whatever. \u201cAs of now, no update, nothing other than the fact he felt uncomfortable. Not in the same spot where he had a break earlier. Same foot, but not really related as of now. But we did have more than one doctor look at him over at football. Then we had a couple more doctors in our locker room. So right now, nothing unless whatever tests they run, something comes up.\u201d My midnight in Fayetteville takeaways (2 parts) following Arkansas' Red/White Showcase on Wed @ Barnhill Arena -Rain falling outside, Hogs raining 3's inside -Players who stood out -Injury updates -Key recruiting updates, incl '24 Hog target announcing on Thurs More Arkansas Razorbacks R/W gm highlights from Barnhill -Makhi Mitchell drives left for window finish (reel 1) -Jeremiah Davenport drives paint for runner (reel 2) -Joseph Pinion dials up his 3rd triple (reel 3) -Davenport w/lightning-fast release on C&S corner 3 (reel 4) More Arkansas Razorbacks R/W gm highlights from Barnhill Arena on Wed \u2026 -Chandler Lawson wing middy (reel 1) -El Ellis drains corner Jnin transition (reel 2) -Devo & Lawson w/brilliant give-&-go in transition (reel 3) -Denijay Harris smash-cashes in 1 of his 5 stls (reel 4) One of the strengths of senior big man Makhi Mitchell's game is his roll to the cup after setting a pick \u2026 nice 2-man game here as sophomore G Keyon Menifield, Jr. fitted in a dime to set up Khi's finish \u2026 from R/W game @ Barnhill Arena on Wed \u2026 Arkansas senior forward Chandler Lawson was solid, finishing w/dbl-dbl (13p, 10r, 2b, 1s) in the Red win \u2026 Lawson's length, instincts tracking down rbs & battling for 50/50-balls in the paint, & competent face-up shooting look top-rotation worthy \u2026 Arkansas guard Devo Davis was givin' junior wing Tramon Mark the business on D \u2026 until \u2026 well, Mark hit the gas & snow-coned the finish off the window for the White team \u2026 This \u2026 is \u2026 Arkansas sophomore wing \u2026 JOSEPH PINION !!!

    "content": "Darren Kellenschwiler\u2019s long BSV blockchain history runs from the tumultuous days of the BCH-BSV split to his current role as a technical lead at the . On this week\u2019s , Darren takes a trip down memory lane with Charles Miller, recalling the end of 2018 when he hosted Bitcoin meetups in London. It was during this period that the BCH and BSV split occurred, resulting in heated debates and ideological divisions within the community. Darren recalled the atmosphere, when \u201ceverything was a little tumultuous, and people were taking different ideological stances. There were very strong arguments\u2014over a beer! That\u2019s the sort of atmosphere at that time. It was the hash wars era.\u201d Darren was on the BSV blockchain side of the divide, firmly believing in Dr. Craig Wright as the inventor of . As he explained, \u201cI had made my mind up years before that this chap, Dr Wright is the inventor of Bitcoin. So I didn\u2019t really waste my time with the crowd that were somehow rebelling against him.\u201d As BSV blockchain emerged, Darren took \u201ca leap of faith\u201d despite the ongoing debates about Dr. Craig Wright. As he says, \u201cThere wasn\u2019t a lot of public detail with respect to the evidence for Dr. Craig Wright having invented Bitcoin.\u201d This period also marked the birth of the \u201cBitcoin protocol is set in stone\u201d campaign. One of Darren\u2019s notable contributions to the BSV blockchain community was , an email application integrated with micropayments. He explained his motivation behind it: \u201cI don\u2019t like spam. I hate reading emails that are not relevant to me. So I thought, attach some value to it. We\u2019ll create \u2018inbox economics,\u2019 where the highest in the inbox is the person who paid you the most for you to read it.\u201d While Baemail gained quick adoption within the BSV blockchain community, it faced challenges in achieving widespread usage due to limitations in BSV wallet adoption. Darren\u2019s journey continued when he met Brendan Lee from at a conference in London. Brendan bought Baemail and hired Darren, making him a co-founder of the company. Together, they delved into building Metanet applications and experimenting with hosting entire websites on the Metanet, a concept that was both groundbreaking and esoteric at the time. Today, Darren serves as the technical lead of the utilization value stream at the BSV Blockchain Association. He described his role as multifaceted, involving contributions to various aspects of the BSV blockchain ecosystem. He also emphasized the Association\u2019s responsibility to ensure that the user experience and businesses built on BSV blockchain remain intact and thrive. Darren also highlighted his passion for tackling complex challenges and his role in documenting, analyzing, and improving wallet architectures within the BSV blockchain ecosystem. He mentioned the importance of effective communication and collaboration with developers, including discussions with Dr. Craig Wright, to advance the ecosystem\u2019s growth and development. Darren Kellenschwiler\u2019s journey in the BSV blockchain ecosystem exemplifies the resilience and dedication of individuals committed to the vision of a stable, scalable, and innovative blockchain. As BSV blockchain continues to evolve, Darren and others like him play a pivotal role in shaping its future.",

    "description": "Political scientist Theda Skocpol on how tea party politics laid the foundation for the GOP\u2019s current troubles.",
    "content": "In the hours after the House of Representatives\u2019 historic vote to oust Kevin McCarthy from the speakership, a photo began circulating online of the cover of Young Guns , the splashy policy treatise authored by then-Reps. Eric Cantor, Paul Ryan and Kevin McCarthy in 2010. The irony of the photo was clear enough: The book, which featured a gleaming group portrait of the three self-declared standard-bearers of the Republican Party, was intended to introduce the rising stars of the GOP to the American people \u2014 but now, just 13 years after its publication, the book had become a visual obituary for the party\u2019s past. When I called Theda Skocpol \u2014 a political scientist at Harvard University who\u2019s written extensively about the rise of the tea party and the transformation of the Republican Party \u2014 shortly after the House kicked McCarthy out of the speakership, she was staring at this same photo. \u201cI\u2019m sitting here looking at a picture on my iPad of the three \u2018Young Guns\u2019 from that iconic cover of their book,\u201d she said. \u201cAll three of them were felled in succession by the popular anger of the tea party base.\u201d The tea party that Skocpol was referring to no longer formally exists as a faction in Congress, its erstwhile allies having been subsumed into the far-right Freedom Caucus or into the generic \u201cAmerica First\u201d wing of the GOP. But according to Skocpol, the history of the tea party remains essential to understanding the forces that ultimately led to McCarthy\u2019s political demise. \u201cIt represents the culmination of [the tea party movement],\u201d said Skocpol. \u201cAll the research that I and other political scientists have done on the movement shows that by the 2010s \u2014 just before Donald Trump emerges \u2014 the tea party had taken the shape of a just-say-no, blow-it-all-up, don\u2019t-cooperate, do-politics-on-Twitter faction \u2014 and this is the perfect expression of it. This is where it leads.\u201d In some respects, Skocpol\u2019s argument is counterintuitive. In the late 2000s and early 2010s, McCarthy and the other Young Guns rose to power by harnessing the grassroots power of the tea party movement, promising to slash government spending, constrain federal power and foil the Obama administration\u2019s policy goals. But though McCarthy and the other Young Guns rose to prominence by allying themselves with the tea party movement, Skocpol said, their banishment from the GOP doesn\u2019t mark a break with the movement\u2019s legacy. Instead, it shows that the Young Guns never really understood the forces that they helped unleash. \u201cThe fact that McCarthy and the other Young Guns were once called tea party people because they dallied with the movement,\u201d Skocpol said, \u201cdoes not mean that the tiger wasn\u2019t going to consume them in the end.\u201d The following has been edited for clarity and concision. Ian Ward: You\u2019ve written extensively about the history of the tea party movement and its aftereffects for the Republican Party. How does the vote to oust Speaker McCarthy fit into that history? Theda Skocpol: Shortly into Barack Obama\u2019s presidency, we saw this explosion of tea party demonstrations and a remarkable degree of grassroots organizing \u2014 a couple thousand local tea parties, according to our research. There was a lot of writing at the time claiming that this organization was motivated by the same thing that people now claim drives the Republican Party when they shut down the government \u2014 cutting the deficit. But it was never about cutting the deficit. The popular side of the tea party was about anger and fear of a changing country in which a guy with \u2018Hussein\u2019 as his middle name and black skin could be elected president. The tea party \u2014 especially at the grassroots \u2014 was trying to pressure the Republican Party and its elected leaders not to compromise with a changing country or with Democratic Party politicians in Washington. Ward: How did the Young Guns fit into that mobilization? Skocpol: The tea party mobilization made a big difference electorally in 2010 in installing a Republican Congress, and probably even more importantly in installing Republican-dominated state legislatures. But it was especially potent after that in undoing any effort at compromise over immigration. Our research shows that polarization over immigration between the two major parties has played out recently and piled on top of the polarization over the civil rights revolution of the 1960s. By the time you get to the period at the end of Barack Obama\u2019s presidency, he\u2019s trying to find a way to incorporate long-present immigrants from Mexico and Central America and give them a path to citizenship \u2014 and that effort falls apart in 2013 and 2014. Remember that election in which David Brat in central Virginia shockingly felled Eric Cantor, who at that time was seen as the kind of rising golden boy on the Republican right? It was anger over the potential of immigration reform that played a big role in that. And then you have Paul Ryan, who inherited a Congress where the Republican caucus was increasingly riven by the rise of this angry, just-say-no style that the tea party always favored. They wanted to make sure that people were angry about changes in the country and wanted to make sure Republicans were not compromising about those. Paul Ryan was [from] Mr. Koch\u2019s network. I think that House Republicans thought that by making him their leader, they would cement their right-wing Republican credentials\u2014 and it did with the elites around the Republican Party at the time. But among the populist right \u2014 who make up more than half of Republican base voters and the most loyal primary voters \u2014they never liked what he had to offer. So he was gone before long. And now finally, we get to Kevin McCarthy, who is just an example of the final transmogrification of the tea party anger, which was given a national focus and much more potency by Donald Trump. Donald Trump didn\u2019t create all this. He\u2019s just been very good, ever since 2015, at giving it permission and focus. Ward: McCarthy and the other Young Guns who rose to power during that tea party moment in the late 2000s and early 2010s gave voice to one interpretation of the tea party movement that you mentioned, which is that it was all about fiscal conservatism and small government. Why do you think they so dramatically misunderstood the energies behind the movement? Skocpol: We have to understand the radicalization of the Republican Party as a process that has been underway since 2000. Act 1 of that radicalization was the rise of the Koch network, which was itself motivated by displeasure with what the Republicans under Bush junior and senior had been doing \u2014 for example, passing Medicare expenditures. The Koch network outflanked the Republican Party, and they put a lot of pressure on candidates and officeholders to hew the line on cutting taxes, cutting regulations and disabling public sector unions. These Young Guns were initially in tune with that \u2014 and why wouldn\u2019t they be? They thought that\u2019s where the money came from and where the business community had gone. But that wasn\u2019t satisfactory to a lot of base voters around the Republican Party, who were much angrier about social changes in the country and much more upset about immigration. So I think the Republican Party was first hollowed out at the top, and then the tea party crystallized when Barack Obama was elected president and then it ended up being given further expression during the immigration reform battles and the rise of Donald Trump. I call it the bottom-up radicalization of the Republican Party, and I think it caught a lot of these Koch network darlings, including all three of these Young Guns, by surprise \u2014 although in McCarthy\u2019s case, I think he has done his best to ride the tiger. He\u2019s tried to have it both ways. Ward: Why do you think McCarthy was able to ride that tiger for longer than the other two? Skocpol: He\u2019s a shapeshifter, and that\u2019s given him staying power \u2014 up until the moment he had Democratic votes to keep the government open and then went on TV over the weekend and trashed the Democrats. The shape shifting is both a strength and a weakness. It\u2019s a strength in that, a little bit more effectively than Paul Ryan before him, he\u2019s been able to have it both ways \u2014 to condemn Donald Trump and then embrace him, to say he\u2019s about cutting the deficit and he\u2019s about cracking down on the border. If the Republican Party really had wings \u2014 and I don\u2019t think it does at this point \u2014 he might have been able to bridge them. But by the end, he got to the point where nobody trusted him. I don\u2019t think anybody in the Republican Party trusted his word, and Democrats definitely couldn\u2019t. Ward: Given the fact that McCarthy rose to power during the tea party moment, is there any sense in which his ouster represents a repudiation of the tea party legacy? Skocpol: No \u2014 it represents the culmination of it. I think most people in the in the media thought the tea party was about cutting the federal budget deficit because that\u2019s what a few elite spokesmen on TV said it was about. But our research always showed that at the grassroots, it was about popular anger over a changing country and fury at a Republican Party that was not responding to that desire. All the research that I and other political scientists have done on the movement shows that by the 2010s, just before Donald Trump emerges, the tea party had taken the shape of a just-say-no, blow-it-all-up, don\u2019t-cooperate, do-politics-on-Twitter faction \u2014 and this is the perfect expression of it. This is where it leads. The fact that McCarthy and the other Young Guns were once called tea party people because they dallied with the movement does not mean that the tiger wasn\u2019t going to consume them in the end. Ward: The conflict between the tea party and the Obama-era Republican Party reflected some real ideological differences between those two factions, especially on issues like immigration. Do you think the conflict between the far-right, anti-McCarthy wing of the party and McCarthy\u2019s backers reflects a similarly robust ideological fissure? Or does it just boil down to rank obstructionism? Skocpol : I think it\u2019s post-ideological. One of the things that Trump\u2019s presidency accomplished was to give national expression to populist ethno-nationalism and anger at \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d in Washington, D.C, and you get to a certain point where there aren\u2019t many moderates at all in the Republican House caucus. There certainly are some people who are cross pressured because they come from Biden districts, but most of them have been enthusiastic supporters of the same kinds of issues that Matt Gaetz is speaking to. This is a disagreement over whether you should ever settle for less than 100 percent of what you want, even when you\u2019re in a position where you don\u2019t control more than one chamber. Ward: So if the conflict is essentially about tactics and the real energies behind the far right are cultural, why do people like Gaetz still lean so heavily on the language of fiscal conservatism? After all, this most recent incident was partly set off by McCarthy\u2019s unwillingness or inability to slash spending levels. Skocpol: You\u2019re not going to like the answer I\u2019m going to give you. Ward: Try me. Skocpol: It sells with the Washington press corps. Why anybody believes this is beyond me. Did you see what Donald Trump did when he was office? Did you see what Republicans did when they controlled the entire Congress? They don\u2019t cut anything, except taxes. And that keeps a certain number of billionaires \u2014 and even Charles Koch himself \u2014 happy. There are two strands that have played out in the Republican Party during recent years. One of them I call \u201cMcConnellism.\u201d McConnellism is clever. It\u2019s about using every lever of power to make sure Republicans get the federal judiciary full of judges who are going to disempower Democratic initiatives, and it\u2019s about doing everything you can to shape the electorate, both by encouraging your own voters and discouraging the other guys\u2019 voters. It\u2019s at the edge of what\u2019s legally and constitutionally legitimate. Then there\u2019s Trumpism, which at this point has gone from bullying and threatening to actual calls for violence. One of them is very powerful in the House, and the other is very powerful in the Senate. But it\u2019s a tactical difference. It\u2019s not as if there\u2019s a huge difference of policy. I think there might be some differences in policy over immigration, but those don\u2019t really come up because nobody\u2019s talking about legislating on immigration. Ward: So what does all this mean for the future of the Republican Party? What are the ramifications of the argument that you\u2019re making \u2014 that there\u2019s a fundamental continuity between the tea party movement and the MAGA movement? Skocpol: Well, everything depends on whether Donald Trump is reelected president, and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s impossible. I really don\u2019t. As for the House of Representatives, I really do not know how they\u2019re going to find a new Kevin McCarthy who can promise enough because the promises that are being demanded are impossible to fulfill. Ward: Based on the traditional tea party playbook, though, what do you think the endgame here is for the far-right faction in the House? Skocpol: Well, I think Matt Gaetz himself wants to get on TV, raise a lot of money and run for another office. That\u2019s true of a number of the people who make up this very small group of people who were in a position to pull the hook on the grenade. But I don\u2019t think we know how this is going to come out. If you\u2019ve got people in power who are backed by a large number of voters who are angry, fearful, limited in the information they get about what\u2019s going on and thinking that it would be better to blow America up than to save it \u2014 I think you\u2019re in uncharted territory. We are in uncharted territory.",

The 2024 presidential hopeful, who is polling second behind former President Donald Trump in the race for the Republican nomination, promises an energy policy to benefit \u201cMidland over Moscow,\u201d \u201cThe Marcellus over the Mullahs,\u201d and \u201cthe Bakken over Beijing.\u201d An all-of-the-above energy plan makes sense for a country as rich in natural resources as the United States, but there\u2019s always the risk of national campaigns to throw the baby out with the bathwater. \u201cThe self-imposed handcuffs on oil, gas, and critical minerals extraction will be removed,\u201d DeSantis said at a late-September campaign event in Midland, Texas, the heart of the Permian Basin, the nation\u2019s largest oil-producing basin. To remove those handcuffs, DeSantis wants to unwind the United State\u2019s current climate commitments, including withdrawing from the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement. Former President Donald Trump exited the Paris Agreement in 2017, a decision incoming President Joe Biden reversed on his first day in the Oval Office.

I believe the Biden administration has overreached in advancing a rapid transition to an all-electric economy, but not every policy decision is wrong. Correcting course will require a deft hand that can keep what works while ensuring that American families and businesses have access to abundant and affordable energy. The next administration should conduct a full review of the current policies to ensure that abundance, affordability, and American-produced are at the top of the to-do list. In addition to pulling out of the Paris deal, DeSantis says he would walk back the 2021 Global Methane Pledge to slash emissions globally by at least 30% by 2030 from 2020 levels and strike environmental, social, and governance (ESG) disclosure requirements that have tempered investors\u2019 confidence in traditional energy stocks despite the industry paying record dividends. The domestic oil and gas industry is committed to reducing emissions and minimizing the environmental impact of its activities, so eliminating artificial barriers to investment and access to capital, as the ESG trend has done, is a good start toward achieving our universal environmental goals. Like Trump\u2019s \u201cMaking America Energy Independent Again\u201d agenda , DeSantis leans heavily on pledges to rip up the Biden administration\u2019s policies favoring climate change over energy security and economic growth, including reversing restrictions to oil and gas production on public lands. Energy abundance and affordability should be our highest goals. A wealthy nation is far better positioned to address the challenges of a changing climate than a poor one. DeSantis promises to \u201cexpand federal lease sales and devolve more leasing authority to the states.\u201d The Biden administration has largely constrained new leasing to court-ordered sales or those prescribed in last year\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act. The administration recently canceled leases in Alaska\u2019s National Petroleum Reserve (NPR\u2013A), frustrating the industry and Republicans on Capitol Hill, and released a five-year offshore leasing plan that made no one happy. DeSantis is pledging to refill the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR), which Biden tapped before the 2020 election to tame rising gas prices \u2013 another example of politics interfering with public policy decisions. DeSantis says he would only use the nation\u2019s emergency oil reserve \u2013 the SPR is at its lowest level since the early 1980s \u2013 for actual supply disruptions. Given the geopolitical situation in Europe and the revanchment of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its Russian ally, to say nothing of the rise of China, maintaining robust reserves makes sense. DeSantis promises to revitalize America\u2019s nuclear and automobile industries. DeSantis would repeal Biden\u2019s electric vehicle (EVs) mandates and \u201csupport Americans\u2019 right to drive the cars they want.\u201d That doesn\u2019t mean he opposes EVs, but he believes they must be able to compete in the marketplace without government subsidies. DeSantis says he plans to jumpstart critical mineral mining on federal lands and create a strategic reserve of critical minerals to ensure America can compete in the energy transition with China, which controls 90% of the world's critical minerals. Streamlining environmental reviews and permitting is another priority for the Florida governor, as is preventing \u201cabusive litigation\u201d by environmental groups that have used the courts to block projects like the Dakota Access and Keystone XL pipelines by filing frivolous lawsuits. New rules targeting natural gas stoves, furnaces, and appliances would be repealed under DeSantis, giving Americans greater choice in how they want to cook and heat their homes. Such nanny state laws should be repealed wherever they are found because they create hurdles for competition and innovation in the marketplace. DeSantis likewise promises to repeal Biden\u2019s Clean Energy Plan , which demands a 90% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2035-2040 from power plants \u2013 essentially forcing a switch to renewable energy sources like wind and solar despite cost considerations. The country might be better served by a more modest goal that's attainable and doesn't scare off investment in the energy resources we need today \u2013 and will need for decades to come. The boldest \u2013 and most controversial \u2013 part of DeSantis\u2019 agenda is his promise of $2 per gallon retail gasoline prices by 2025, requiring pump prices to fall by about $1.85 from the current national average. That would require a crude oil price of about $55 a barrel, which could hurt U.S. crude oil production by putting too many new prospects below breakeven cost levels for new wells. U.S. refiners may also lack the capacity to deliver gasoline at that price level. Indeed, gasoline prices haven\u2019t touched the $2 a gallon level since the depths of the pandemic in 2020, when fuel demand collapsed under the weight of government-mandated lockdowns. Such a sharp price drop would also require cooperation from the OPEC cartel, whose member states are cutting supply to boost prices above $100 a barrel. The fix is literally in to keep pump prices high. Our only hope for seeing those prices fall is to increase domestic production. That won't happen overnight, but we have the resources; we just need the will. Overall, though, the feeling among American energy executives is that DeSantis is taking positive positions for national security and traditional energy producers. He prioritizes fossil fuel production, removing regulatory red tape and keeping the government out of industry decision-making over the pace and trajectory of the low-carbon transition. DeSantis\u2019 energy priorities reflect his concerns about the impact of energy cost inflation on Americans today rather than positioning the United States as a global leader in the fight against climate change. But he's also looking to take advantage of the economic and jobs opportunities offered by the diversification of the energy sector, focusing on critical minerals mining and a strategic reserve for these strategic resources.

    "description": "The exclusives Microsoft released for Xbox Series X/S this year have made 2023 feel like what 2020 should have felt like.",
    "content": "Even though we\u2019re almost three years into the life span of the Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S , it feels like this console generation is just starting for Microsoft. It\u2019s no secret that Xbox was slow to start up and then maintain consistency this console generation. For example, 2020 saw the company putting out a weak console launch lineup made up of ports and remasters. While 2021 had a flurry of great games, it was followed by a comparatively barren 2022. And 2023 hasn\u2019t been perfect either (due, in large part, to the flop that is Redfall ) , but outside of that, this year delivered the excellent Hi-Fi Rush , the grandly scaled Starfield , solid ports of two Age of Empires games and Quake II , a new Minecraft title, and a technical showpiece in Forza Motorsport . Recommended Videos Looking at that varied lineup, these games showcase both the potential of the Series X and the power of Xbox as a brand. Prospects for Xbox\u2019s lineup are up heading into 2024 too, so it feels like we\u2019re at the proper start of the Xbox Series X and S console generation \u2026 even if it came a few years too late. Related Baldur\u2019s Gate 3 drops Series S splitscreen support to release on Xbox in 2023 Xbox Games Showcase and Starfield Direct: how to watch and what to expect How many games featured in Xbox\u2019s 2022 showcase actually launched within 12 months? A new beginning Looking at the 2020 launch lineup for Xbox Series X/S, it wasn\u2019t exactly emblematic of what the console could do. While there were some nice 4K and 60 frames per second (fps) upgrades for Xbox One games, the only new draws were a console port of Gears Tactics , the multiplayer-supporting Tetris Effect: Connected , a temporary next-gen exclusive version of Yakuza: Like a Dragon , and some smaller indies like The Falconeer and Bright Memory 1.0 . Xbox Game Studios Most of those games were on or came to more platforms afterward and, in general, didn\u2019t provide that strong of an argument for why players should stick around this console generation. But looking at many of the games Xbox has released this year, it finally feels like we have a bundle of good Xbox exclusives that show what the platform was always capable of. In my review of Forza Motorsport , I note that the game feels like a launch title because it\u2019s an impressive technical showpiece. It runs at 4K and 60 fps in performance mode, which is something not many games this generation have done. The closest comparable games are Astro\u2019s Playroom and Marvel\u2019s Spider-Man Remastered on PlayStation 5, which effectively demonstrated the power of Sony\u2019s console early on. Forza Motorsport was also built as a platform that developer Turn 10 Studios can expand over time. It plans to periodically slot in new single and multiplayer content, including new cars and tracks. A game like that makes a lot of sense early on in a console\u2019s life span in this live-service era. It\u2019s what Microsoft tried to do with Halo Infinite , even if that didn\u2019t pan out as expected due to a one-year delay, and with Killer Instinct on Xbox One. Xbox Game Studios Then there\u2019s the matter of games that intrinsically feel next-gen in scope. While that\u2019s a much more nebulous feeling from person to person, the scale of a game like Starfield feels like something that wouldn\u2019t have worked or run as well on an Xbox One. It\u2019s a landmark, zeitgeisty first-party release that got the whole video game industry talking, which is something that Xbox has only managed to do a few times over the past decade and could have sorely used at the start of this console generation. On top of that, you\u2019ve got Hi-Fi Rush and Minecraft Legends as 2023 stand-ins for the typical quirkier launch titles, in line with games like Sackboy: A Big Adventure or Ryse: Son of Rome . The Age of Empires ports show unification between the PC and console publishing departments of Xbox. And it\u2019s also been a solid year for day-one Xbox Game Pass titles, with third-party games like Exoprimal and Lies of P hitting the subscription on launch day . It\u2019s perhaps the first time in nearly a decade that Xbox has seemed healthy on both the first-party and third-party fronts. Xbox Game Studios While it\u2019s impossible to say that Xbox has fully gotten its mojo back or that this is a definitive end to Microsoft\u2019s struggles, 2023 is still the first year where it has genuinely felt like the Series X vision is coming into focus. We\u2019ve gotten a comprehensive game lineup and reason to have faith in the viability of the future game lineup thanks to a packed summer showcase this June. It feels like a console launch year for Xbox. While that is a bit concerning as we\u2019re three years into these consoles\u2019 life spans, it hopefully is a sign that things will be better going forward, with Xbox truly rebounding after the lows of 2022 and Redfall . So, what does this feeling mean for players? For Xbox Series X and S owners, we finally are getting a sense of consistency and validation for the hardware we picked up, in some cases, almost three years ago. For those who don\u2019t own an Xbox system, it\u2019ll feel like the generation just started if you pick one up now and immediately download Forza Motorsport, Starfield , and Hi-Fi Rush . Editors' Recommendations You don\u2019t need an Xbox Series X to play Starfield.

    "description": "A new study finds an esketamine nasal spray achieved remission and prevented relapse of depression in patients with treatment-resistant depression.",
    "content": "A new study is offering more evidence in support of the former party drug in helping hard-to-treat depression. Depression is a , but an erstwhile party drug is projected to flip the narrative and improve the lives of those in desperate need. Over the last several years, \u2014 especially forms impervious to conventional treatment, known as treatment-resistant depression \u2014 by rewiring the brain, encouraging a phenomenon known as neuroplasticity. Currently, ketamine is only approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as an anesthetic; it isn\u2019t approved to treat any mental health conditions. But it\u2019s seeing off-label use in clinics offering intravenous infusions (often at a ), , and more recently, through nasal sprays. In 2019, the , an intranasal nasal spray containing esketamine, a molecule derived from the drug, based on clinical trials demonstrating its potency in not only treating but keeping treatment-resistant depression at bay. Now, a new study is offering more evidence in support of esketamine, positioning the nasal spray as even more effective than antidepressant medications like quetiapine, also known as Seroquel. In a clinical trial spanning 24 countries, among 336 participants already on an antidepressant, 28 percent saw remission of their symptoms after eight weeks on the esketamine nasal spray versus 18 percent of a similar-sized group taking quetiapine in addition to their usual antidepressants. After about 32 weeks, 22 percent of the esketamine remained in remission as opposed to 14 percent in the quetiapine group. Medical experts say these results are promising for patients with treatment-resistant depression, but more research is needed to see how truly effective the esketamine nasal spray is compared to other antidepressants \u2014 not just quetiapine \u2014 and whether the former party drug is safe for patients to take long-term. The in the . Lasting remission While a majority of individuals with depression will get better with conventional antidepressant medications, 10 to 30 percent don\u2019t respond to treatment at all. called the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (or STAR*D) study, those getting treatment for depression will generally enter remission (or return to normal levels of functioning) in a step-wise fashion: 30 percent after the first treatment, 50 percent after two treatments, 60 percent after three, and 70 percent after four. Studies show esketamine does seem to work pretty well when compared against a placebo for individuals with hard-to-treat depression, , director of the Center for Affective Disorders at King\u2019s College London, who co-led the study, tells . However, there hasn\u2019t been much data on how the esketamine nasal spray stacks up against other recognized, more affordable treatment options like quetiapine. Typically, ketamine is delivered as an intravenous infusion. To suss out how well it works against other treatments, 676 adults between 18 and 74 were recruited and screened from August 2020 to November 2021 across 24 countries. These were individuals with treatment-resistant depression already on an antidepressant \u2014 either a selective serotonin or serotonin-norepinephrine inhibitor. Participants were randomly put into two groups, but knew what they were getting: the esketamine sprayed up the nose twice a week in a health care setting or quetiapine taken daily. \u201cA very important thing of this study was to look at not only the people who got better but also stayed better over the course of 32 weeks,\u201d says Young. And that\u2019s what the researchers saw. After eight weeks of treatment, 28 percent of the esketamine group saw remission of their treatment-resistant depression, and 24 weeks after the initial treatment, 22 percent didn\u2019t relapse. (Whether someone was functioning back to normal was determined by the Montgomery-\u00c5sberg Depression Rating Scale, a 10-item clinician-rated scale used to assess the severity of depressive symptoms in those with mood disorders.) This is compared to 18 percent in the quetiapine group, 14 percent of whom didn\u2019t relapse after the same time period. Therapeutic potential with many questions , chief of psychiatry at Massachusetts General Hospital, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study, told in an email that the findings were in line with what many clinicians have come to expect with the efficacy of nasal esketamine for people with treatment-resistant depression. However, because the study was limited to comparing esketamine to quetiapine, it\u2019s hard to say how much better the nasal spray is compared to other drugs used for treatment-resistant depression. For , professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, who was also not involved in the study, there are concerns about how much the placebo effect may be at play during the course of the entire clinical trial, given participants knew what they were getting and the fact esketamine can only be administered in-person by a health care professional. \u201cThere\u2019s a big placebo effect of giving that much attention to a patient,\u201d he tells . He also mentions other factors at play, separate from the placebo effect. \u201cPeople get a little bit of high when they get [the esketamine nasal spray].\u201d While giving short-term doses of esketamine appears to be safe for patients, Anand says there\u2019s the issue of potential addiction associated with esketamine with prolonged use, which needs to be further investigated. Right now, it\u2019s not entirely clear how long esketamine can keep depressive symptoms at bay. Young says when treating severe or recurrent depression with conventional antidepressants, a patient would need to remain on medication for about six months although this can be as long as two years. He believes this could be the same for nasal esketamine. Like ketamine infusions, esketamine nasal sprays aren\u2019t cheap, but they may be more cost-effective, . As millions of people around the world suffer from depression, the hope remains for esketamine to revolutionize the way we approach mental health care.",

    "content": "A toxic cocktail of damaging chemicals created by road pollution is flowing into England\u2019s rivers and no regulator is monitoring the scale of its impact on wildlife or public health. More than 18,000 outfalls, such as pipes, and about 7,700 soakaways managed by National Highways discharge rainwater potentially contaminated with heavy metals, hydrocarbons, microplastics and other chemicals from the main road network into rivers and on to land. Last month, National Highways reported it had assessed its discharge points and found 1,236 outfalls and soakaways had \u201ca potential high risk of pollution\u201d. Of these, \u201c145 have a verified high risk of pollution and require mitigation\u201d while the remaining 1,091 had a \u201cpotential high risk\u201d of \u201cpolluting the water environment\u201d. runoff map Analysis by the Guardian and Watershed Investigations of hundreds of these sites reveals that about 70 are located in areas that are legally protected for important habitats or wildlife, and about 250 are within 1km (0.6 miles) of a protected site. Hundreds more discharge to rivers and land with no formal protection. Despite urban and transport pollution accounting for 18% of England\u2019s water bodies failing to meet good ecological standards, highways outfalls are not regulated under environmental permitting regulations, which means there is less scrutiny and no monitoring in place. Guy Linley-Adams, a solicitor at the charity Wildfish, said: \u201cThe Environment Agency has the power to bring highways drains and discharges under environmental permitting if they involve \u2018the discharge or entry to inland freshwaters, coastal waters or relevant territorial waters of any \u2026 poisonous, noxious or polluting matter\u2019. \u201cThat would certainly appear to be the case here, so the agency must show that it has considered the problem and explain why it has not yet, to our knowledge, required permits that limit pollution of rivers from, at the very least, the higher risk discharges that have been identified by National Highways. \u201cIt is no good just saying: \u2018We don\u2019t know how big this problem is.\u2019 Put simply, the agency has a duty to find out.\u201d National Highways said it did not routinely monitor runoff because the results varied depending on rainfall and river flows, and because it would not be practical or good value. It had instead developed a predictive tool to determine scenarios where the risk of impacts on water quality were unacceptably high. The lack of monitoring makes it impossible to understand the scale of the pollution but it is also hampered by lack of knowledge over the total number of outfalls across the country. Jo Bradley, a former Environment Agency officer who runs the Stormwater Shepherds not-for-profit, said: \u201cNational Highways operates 3% of the road network and they have over 25,000 outfalls and soakaways. Imagine how many there are across the entire road network. The number of these outfalls dwarfs the 15,000 storm sewer overflows, and perhaps the impact of the pollution is worse.\u201d Ten potentially high-risk outfalls drain runoff from the M27 bridge into the River Hamble conservation area, which flows into the Solent. Some of England\u2019s rare and fragile chalk streams are also under threat from runoff; the M1 discharges into the River Colne, near Watford, and runoff from the M3 flows into the River Itchen, in Hampshire, which is home to salmon, brown trout, grayling and otters. A cluster of 24 outfalls surround the River Kennet chalk stream area and its tributaries near Reading. Official data shows the river system has high levels of heavy metals and hydrocarbons, which are associated with road runoff. Charlotte Hitchmough, the director of Action for the River Kennet, said: \u201cThe people responsible for highway drainage actively encourage the disposal of polluted rain water straight into the river, even rivers that have the highest levels of legal environmental protection. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Down to Earth Free weekly newsletter The planet's most important stories.

In urban areas this is a perennial problem. Every summer we experience fish kills in those rivers where there are fish remaining.\u201d Fish are not the only species under threat. Prof Andrew Johnson, from the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, said persistent and bioaccumulative chemicals such as PAHs could reach the ocean, \u201cin which case we start to worry about animals such as cetaceans [dolphins, porpoises and whales]\u201d. However, he said the risk was hard to determine because the chemical loads were unknown. An Environment Agency spokesperson said outfalls and road drains were \u201cnot directly regulated by the Environment Agency but we do work with the government and partner organisations to reduce pollution from roads. This includes working closely with National Highways to influence their road investment strategy to include pollution mitigating schemes on their priority list of outfalls.\u201d Stephen Elderkin, the director of environmental sustainability at National Highways, said: \u201cWe are committed to addressing all of our high-risk water outfalls by 2030 and our water quality plan 2030 sets out a high-level programme of work to achieve this \u2026 National Highways has also invested in a programme of research to understand the risk of pollution from microplastics in road runoff.\u201d Under National Highways\u2019 plan, four outfalls have confirmed funding for mitigation this year, and \u201c17 outfalls and soakaways have been identified for potential delivery in 2024-25\u201d. Dr Sue Young, the head of land use planning at the Wildlife Trusts, said it was \u201chugely concerning that National Highways doesn\u2019t actually know the scale of the problem, and despite having identified over a thousand potentially polluting outfalls, it is mitigating just four of these this year. It\u2019s hard to see, with this snail\u2019s pace of action, how they will resolve this toxic issue by 2030. \u201cNature is in crisis now, with one in seven species in the UK at risk of extinction. We believe the next road investment strategy should allocate funding to act with greater ambition to stop this pollution now, rather than allowing most sites to continue putting this toxic mix into our most vulnerable rivers and streams until almost the end of the decade.\u201d",

Gold bars and stacks of cash: how Bob Menendez ended up charged with bribery Read more The New Jersey senator temporarily stepped down from his powerful position as chairman of the Senate foreign relations committee in September after he was indicted by federal prosecutors in New York on corruption charges, including allegations that he accepted cash bribes and gold bars in exchange for breaching his duties \u201cin ways that benefited the government of Egypt\u201d. Menendez pleaded not guilty to the allegations and has resisted calls for his resignation, including from fellow Democrats. Among former senior US officials and some Egyptian dissidents, one accusation included in the indictment against the senator stands out: that in May 2018, Menendez procured details from the state department about the number and nationalities of people working at the US embassy in Cairo, one of the largest US missions in the Middle East. Menendez is accused of passing this information to Egyptian officials, via his partner, Nadine Menendez, and a New Jersey businessman, Wael Hanna, who recently pleaded not guilty to charges that he bribed the senator. Menendez, Nadine Menendez and Hanna have all denied wrongdoing. The indictment states that \u201calthough this information was not classified, it was deemed highly sensitive because it could pose significant operational security concerns if disclosed to a foreign government or if made public\u201d. The FBI has also reportedly opened a counterintelligence investigation related to the charges. \u201cIf the allegation is true, this is reprehensible. One of the worst aspects of this is that it\u2019s not only selling influence, it\u2019s really putting people\u2019s lives in jeopardy,\u201d said a former high-ranking state department official who worked across the Middle East, including Egypt. \u201cI\u2019d label this charge in the indictment a betrayal of trust,\u201d said Gordon Gray, a former diplomat with 35 years in the foreign service whose postings included ambassador to Tunisia, senior adviser to the US ambassador to Iraq and deputy chief of mission in Cairo. \u201cOur Egyptian employees \u2026 work for us under potentially high risk to themselves and their families.\u201d It\u2019s also a betrayal of trust of the US government writ large to protect its people Former diplomat Gordon Gray He added: \u201cIt\u2019s also a betrayal of trust of the US government writ large to protect its people.\u201d The state department declined to respond to questions about the impact of the apparent leak or whether it was providing additional security to individuals who may have been compromised. US personnel with knowledge of the Egyptian security state have long understood the specific risks facing diplomats based in Cairo \u2013 and that those working at the embassy, particularly Egyptian nationals, were likely to be the target of surveillance by Egyptian intelligence. Such fears sharply increased after the 2013 military coup that brought Egyptian president Abdel-Fatah al-Sisi to power, which spurred a resurgence in the power of Egyptian intelligence bodies. For the US embassy in Cairo, the arrest and detention of staffer Ahmed Aleiba a year later was a watershed moment. Reporting in Egyptian pro-government media suggested that Aleiba, an Egyptian national, was detained and transferred to the custody of an Egyptian intelligence body after accusations that he had coordinated meetings between US officials and the Muslim Brotherhood, a banned group. Pressure on foreign missions has also extended to those who meet with diplomats: in 2020, two employees of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights, a prominent human rights organisation, were detained by security forces after hosting a meeting for a group of western diplomats at their offices in Cairo. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to First Thing Free daily newsletter Our US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it matters Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Following Menendez\u2019s indictment, acting foreign relations committee chairman Ben Cardin as well as members of Congress moved to block a further $235m, the maximum possible amount, until Egypt\u2019s record on human rights improves. Others said that while the information on embassy staff that Menendez allegedly passed to Egyptian officials was subject to constant change, it was valuable because Egyptian intelligence would have been able to compare it to other data secured through surveillance, to gauge which members of the embassy could be employees of US intelligence organisations and target Egyptian staff working there long term. \u201cThe Egyptian government wouldn\u2019t just be relying on Menendez for information like this \u2013 obviously they have their own sources and methods of how to source it, including visas, passports and counting the numbers,\u201d said Ben Fishman, a former member of the US national security council overseeing north Africa and Jordan. Referring to the allegations in the indictment, he added: \u201cBeing willing to convey that information and forward it on is, in my view, inappropriate for a senator.\u201d Gray pointed to how Egyptians employed at the embassy are particularly vulnerable to intimidation by local security forces. \u201cThe pressures that the locally engaged staff face are always on the mind of US embassies, at least US embassies in non-democracies,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t have diplomatic immunity, and their families are there. It can be a much more precarious situation for them.\u201d One US-based Egyptian dissident said the Egyptian government would be aware of Egyptians staffing the US embassy in Cairo, and believed there were likely already informants who work for Egypt inside the embassy. But he said the alleged sharing of sensitive and non-public information, as described in the indictment, meant that Egypt gained another, highly reliable, source of information about embassy employees. \u201cIt would have been seen as a definitive list,\u201d the person said.",

Styled by , Gomez appeared in a total of three looks over the course of the evening, including a long-sleeved with a botanical print which she wore on stage, a shimmering purple frock shaped like a large lotus flower, and the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance, a crystal-encrusted silver gown with a crystal flower appliqu\u00e9 at the neck. The dazzling dress was perfectly fitted to Gomez's figure, and featured a short train and halter neck. (When she made time for all of these costume changes, I do not know.) Gomez accessorized all three looks with a pair of silver statement earrings and a new bob haircut\u2014because it is the law that all celebrities get a bob now.
