    "description": "Few names are as buzzy in Hollywood and beyond as Sydney Sweeney\u2019s. From her rise in the controversial Sam Levinson show Euphoria to her recent roles in rom-com revival Anyone But You and Marvel\u2019s Madame Web with Dakota Johnson, Sweeney seems to be everywhere. However, in her increasing fame, she\u2019s also stirred up controversy. Sweeney has faced rumors of cheating with her Anyone But You co-star Glen Powell, allegedly lied about working as a tour guide at Universal Studios, and become the Ender of Wokeness, per conservatives, after her appearance on Saturday Night Live. A lot of her buzz and controversy has stemmed from discussions, judgments, and consumption of one thing\u2014her body. As Sydney Sweeney noted during her featured speaker session at South By Southwest on March 12, she\u2019s frequently subjected to objectification by people online. \u201cMy DMs are not a safe space,\u201d she said in response to an audience question. \u201cThere is no respect in those.\u201d However, little recognition has been given to her achievements in the industry at only 26 years old. A shining gem outside of the realm of oft-debated nepo babies, Sweeney grew up in a working-class family in the small town of Spokane, Washington. She\u2019s been vocal about her struggles to make enough money as an actor\u2014even though she appears to be highly successful in the public eye. After scoring breakout roles in shows like Sharp Objects and The White Lotus, she\u2019s now turned her attention to producing. Sweeney revealed that she had to convince her parents to let her audition for an indie film being produced in Spokane when she was 10 years old. So naturally, she created a five-year business plan to present to them. She went on to receive a bachelor\u2019s degree in business, something that informs how she navigates Hollywood. \u201cI am a business,\u201d she said. \u201cYou are a business. Every actor is their own company.\u201d A primary intention of Sweeney\u2019s career is to do things that scare her\u2014and her Saturday Night Live performance was one of those frightening experiences. Despite being an actor, Sweeney said she has terrible stage fright. \u201cIt was terrifying, guys. It was so scary,\u201d she said of her guest appearance on March 2. \u201cMy mouth dried up. I\u2019m having panic attacks thinking about it. But it was so fun.\u2019 The fear continues\u2014in more ways than one\u2014with Sweeney\u2019s upcoming role as Cecilia in the nun horror flick Immaculate, which she also produced. Sweeney called the character her most \u201cterrifying\u201d yet, and the film, premiering at SXSW Film and TV Festival on March 12, has been a long time coming. Sweeney initially auditioned for the role at age 16. She didn\u2019t get the part, but soon after the film fell into industry purgatory. Since 2014, however, Sweeney has been launched into stardom and founded her production company Fifty-Fifty Films. Through her effort, the project actually got made. \u201cI got to make it myself, which when I\u2019m sixteen-\u2014I didn\u2019t know,\u201d she said. \u201cNow, I look back, and I\u2019m like, \u2018Syd, you made it.\u201d While producers are often associated only as names on the checks, Sweeney takes a much more personal route, stating that she \u201cparents\u201d her projects. \u201cI\u2019m part of it from the beginning to the end.\u201d Sweeney wants to ensure her work is a space of equality, considering the group effort that the creation of a film or television show requires. \u201cI truly believe that it takes everybody to create something. It\u2019s not just one person,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to be 50-50 with all of my partners. I want to make sure that everyone has equal deals, feels that they are all equally at the table.\u201d Fittingly, she also gave endless thanks to her collaborators, those who taught her important lessons that she\u2019s carrying forward as a leader in the industry. She cites Sharp Objects director Jean-Marc Vall\u00e9e (\u201cHe saw in me what I hoped other people would see in myself.\u201d), casting director David Rubin, and Michael Mohan, the director of Netflix\u2019s short-lived series Everything Sucks!, as empowering collaborators. Mohan and Sweeney reunited to work on Immaculate, which he also directed. She credited her work with Mohan on Everything Sucks! as the moment she found her own voice on set. \u201cI realized I wanted to be part of more than just acting,\u201d she said. And despite the creeps in her DMs, Sweeney is here for the real fans of her craft. As she noted, \u201cBeing able to connect with so many people through my characters is why I do it.\u201d Sign up to receive the Daily Dot\u2019s Internet Insider newsletter for urgent news from the frontline of online.

    "description": "South Korea has remained muted to a new gold rush fueled by various central banks across the world gobbling up the precious metal, raising concerns that Asia\u2019s fourth-largest economy would be one of a handful of nations missing out on the great profit-making opportunity. According to the World Gold Council on Tuesday, total gold holdings by central banks across the globe added 39 tons in January, extending the latest gold run after reaching 1,037.4 tons in 2023 and 1,081.9 tons in 2022. Over the past two years, the total net purchase of gold by foreign central banks exceeded 2,000 tons, with China leading the pack. The world\u2019s second-largest economy has added 300 tons of the precious metal to its foreign reserves since the People\u2019s Bank of China renewed buying it in October 2022. As of the end of 2023, the central bank\u2019s gold reserves amounted to 2,235.3 tons. Its counterpart in India also upped its gold reserves to 803.5 tons in 2023 from 754.1 tons in 2021, while the National Bank of Poland shoveled in 130 tons of the precious metal between April and November last year. Thanks to the revived global appetite for gold, its price hit a new record of $2,195.15 per troy ounce on March 8. Gold prices retreated to the $1,600 level at the end of 2022 from $1,800 earlier that year but started rebounding last year. Considering the latest price hikes, foreign central banks stockpiling gold are estimated to have enjoyed about 30% return from their gold holdings. Korea\u2019s central bank, however, has not joined the new gold race, with its gold reserves unchanged at 104.4 tons since 2013. TOO LATE TO JUMP ON THE BANDWAGON The main reason that the Bank of Korea is hesitant to up its gold stock is the current gold price, which could be at its peak after the recent rally.The Korean central bank bought 90 tons of gold from 2011 to 2013 at an average price of $1,629 per troy ounce. But soon the gold price plummeted, hovering between $1,100 and $1,300 from 2014 to 2018. The BOK was estimated to have logged about 1.8 trillion won ($1.4 billion) loss from its gold holdings in 2015 due to the price drop. The bank also cites the difficulty of cashing out gold because this safe-haven asset is considered a country\u2019s last resort to safeguard against severe national economic meltdown. The sudden disposal of gold is often seen as a red flag for a country\u2019s economy. Another excuse to distance itself from the latest gold run is the lower return of gold investment than other assets. According to the Bank of Korea, the risk-adjusted annual return of gold investment has averaged at 0.26% since 1973, lower than that of US treasury investment at 0.96% and stock investment at 0.44%. MORE ROOM TO GROW Still, some economists argue that the Korean central bank should consider jumping on the latest gold bandwagon as the most precious metal is forecast to extend its rally longer. \u201cThe price of gold, a typical safe-haven asset, is expected to climb higher once the US starts cutting interest rates, and uncertainty over the global economy grows after the US presidential election later this year,\u201d said Seok Byoung-hoon, professor at the Department of Economics of Ewha Womans University. \u201cIt is time for the Bank of Korea to rebalance its asset portfolio.\u201dGold made up only 1.7% of the Asian country\u2019s foreign exchange reserves. But earlier this year, the bank's official said Korea\u2019s central bank does not have an imminent plan to buy more gold for its foreign exchange reserves.

    "description": "U.S. stocks experienced a rise on Tuesday following consecutive losses for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq. What Happened: This positive turn occurred despite a slightly warmer-than-expected February consumer price index. As per CNBC\u2019s Jim Cramer, the market\u2019s gains were largely unrelated to the CPI, but instead tied to \u201ca lot of stocks reacting positively to good earnings per share news.\u201d \"We're getting lucky that the S & P is up like this,\" Cramer said. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon expressed optimism about the U.S. economy on Tuesday, suggesting the Fed should hold off on interest rate cuts until after June. While acknowledging the possibility of a recession, Dimon believes the market is pricing in a soft landing. See Also: This Could Be A Gamechanger For Natural Gas In Europe Cramer echoed Dimon\u2019s optimism, attributing positive equity movements to solid corporate earnings and ongoing interest in artificial intelligence. This was reinforced by Oracle\u2019s (NYSE:ORCL) strong quarter, attributed to AI strength, which boosted shares by approximately 11%.

The Geoff Keighley-run event has quickly become one of the key events on the games industry's calendar, as several notable projects, big and small, have been announced there. With E3 now completely dead, SGF could be poised to take the expo's place as the anchor for the various gaming events that typically take place in early June.

    "description": "Elden Ring is a huge container of weapons, armor, and all sorts of items. One of the most possibly useful consumable items of the bunch is the Celestial Dew, as it bestows upon the player the power to revive NPCs and thus correct some, ugh, possible \"accidents\" that might occur during the main quest. You might end up never needing Celestial Dew, but this is the Lands Between, a place where it's just best to be prepared for everything at all times, so let's see where to find it. Celestial Dew Locations in Elden Ring You can find Celestial Dew not in one, but in many places in Elden Ring, so I'll just leave you with all of the known locations below in descending order of easier to hardest to get: In my opinion, the easiest Celestial Dew you can get is at Raya Lucaria Academy. Simply teleport or reach the Academy's main gate, then follow the direction below to reach a gate and a corpse holding one Celestial Dew. The map doesn't show it very well, but it's just a simple corridor. Just pay attention to the basic enemy that'll drop from the sky to protect the Dew, and you should be fine. You can also buy Celestial Dew from an NPC named Pidia at Caria Manor. To get there, I recommend you teleport to Ranni's Rise, then move to this position: Screenshot by Destructoid That's the exact location of Pidia, but getting there might be a bit tricky as it requires players to find a specific entrance in a lower position. Luckily, there's this Scarab on the way marking the drop point (really). Screenshot by Destructoid From the Scarab's POV, you'll see: Screenshot by Destructoid You'll need to fall down where marked, then a few more times until you get to the roof with this entrance on it: Screenshot by Destructoid You'll find Pidia, a friendly NPC, right by you as soon as you reach the bottom of the ladder. That's one of the easiest ways to get Celestial Dew in the game. The Ainsel River, despite being an underground area, is a great place for Celestial Dew hunters because you can either buy them from the merchant there or get two additional dews at the Uhl ruins: Screenshot y Destructoid Another great option is Nokron's Eternal City. The Ancestral Woods is a great starting point: Screenshot by Destructoid Once there, just drop down to the roof, move forward, drop down again, and turn right. At the corner, you will be able to see a Dew-carrying corpse. Screenshot by Destructoid Another good place is Leyndell. Get to the site of grace on the Sanctuary, walk up the tree to the upper floor, move to the rooftop, and re-enter the sanctuary through the window. On that floor, you'll find a chest with the Erdtree bow and then, if you keep going past the chest, you'll find a dead guy holding one Celestial Dew. Screenshot by Destructoid I believe this would arguably be the easiest Celestial Dew to get by itself if not for the fact that it's in a late-game area, and thus not immediately ready for players to get. You better start stocking up on Celestial Dew because Elden Ring Shadow Of The Erdtree comes out on June 21, and things are about to get wild.

    "description": "In recent news, Chubb Ltd (NYSE:CB) CEO, Evan Greenberg, has stood by the company\u2019s decision to underwrite the appeal bond of former President Donald Trump in a defamation lawsuit filed by E. Jean Carroll. What Happened: Greenberg, in a customer communication, clarified that Chubb\u2019s role as the surety does not imply support for any party involved in the case. \u201cWe don't take sides, it would be wrong for us to do so and we are in no way supporting the defendant,\u201d he stated, according to a report by The Hill. Last week, Trump signed paperwork for one of Chubb's divisions to underwrite his $91.63 million bond as he appeals the recent civil verdict against him for defaming Carroll, an advice columnist, by denying her sexual assault claims. Greenberg stressed that Chubb\u2019s decision was based on supporting the rule of law and not influenced by personal feelings. He also indicated that Trump\u2019s bond is fully collateralized, although the specifics of the assets put down by Trump remain undisclosed.

    "description": "South Korean rental platforms have become a headache for private equity firms, with their declining profits and dim business outlook making them hard to sell.In 2019, a handful of small-sized homegrown private equity houses snapped up domestic rental service companies each for around 100 billion won ($76 billion) to emulate MBK Partners\u2019 eye-popping exit from the sector leader Coway Co. that produced more than a four-fold return after five years of investment.Five years on, Cactus Private Equity and Daishin Private Equity are struggling to divest of BS On Co. a company that leases office equipment and home appliances. Their consortium put it up for sale in September last year, but has not yet to find its new owner due to a big valuation gap with bidders, according to investment banking industry sources on Wednesday.The two homegrown investment firms jointly acquired BS On for 100 billion won in 2019. Since then, operating profit at BS On has decreased to 11.9 billion won in 2022 and 12.1 billion won in 2021, versus 16.4 billion won in 2019.SV Investment and AJ Capital Partners were another Seoul-based PE houses betting on rental platforms.Thy took over MostX, formerly Modurental, for 100 billion won in 2019. It leases products ranging from household goods to massage devices and pet care products from some 150 brands.Despite its diverse assortment of leasing products, the company\u2019s operating profit more than halved to 4.2 billion won in 2022, compared to 10 billion won in 2020. Sales decreased to 65.6 billion won versus 91.5 billion won over the same period. AJ Capital Partners is a unit of AJ Networks and AJ Rent-A-Car and has no relation to the Tennessee-based investment firm with the same name. In 2019, PS Alliance and Dream Security, a cybersecurity and authentication service company, acquired Korea Rental Corp. for 115.0 billion won. The rental company has been faring poorly since their purchase.Industry observers said domestic rental platforms appear to have reached their growth limit.They are highly dependent on manufacturers, which are now switching to directly leasing their products after building brand awareness on rental platforms.High interest rates have taken a toll as well. Rental companies borrow money from banks or other financial institutions, offering subscription contracts with their customers as collateral. Elevated financing costs have held them back from swiftly responding to the hit product cycle.North Asia-focused MBK Partners reaped more than a fourfold return, or over 1 trillion won, from the exit of its controlling stake in Coway, a rental company of air and water purifiers and bidets, five years after investment.By Jin-Eun Hahazzys@hankyung.com Yeonhee Kim edited this article",

    "description": "Passwords stored in Chrome are convenient, but they can also expose you to risk. Share your device with someone else, and they can log into any website with saved credentials. At least, they can if you haven\u2019t enabled Chrome\u2019s built-in protections. On Windows PCs, you can use Windows Hello to lockdown access to your Chrome passwords. When turned on, you\u2019ll have to enter a PIN or use a biometric authentication method (like a fingerprint or webcam) before Chrome will fill in a login form with your user name and password. Here\u2019s how to enable the feature.

You should be able to skip to Step 2. (However, if you don\u2019t see the option for Windows Hello in Google Password Manager\u2019s settings, return to this step.) The Sign -in options in Windows 10. In the Windows 10 or 11 start menu, type sign-in options \u2014 or open your Settings app and use the search bar to find the sign-in options. Your PC won\u2019t support the biometric methods of Windows Hello authentication without a compatible fingerprint reader or webcam, but a PIN code should be available to set up. Note: Any Windows Hello method you set up will allow you to log into your PC. If you have concerns about the security of the biometric options, you can stick with just a PIN code \u2014 ideally one that\u2019s at least six numbers long. Step 2: Head to Chrome\u2019s settings In a Chrome window, click on the three dot icon in the upper right of the screen. Then choose Settings > Autofill and Passwords > Google Password Manager. In the left navigation bar, select Settings. You can also type chrome://password-manager/settings into the address bar of a Chrome tab and hit enter. Step 3: Turn on Windows Hello protection Flipping that toggle will turn on Windows Hello verification on this PC.PCWorld In the Google Password Manager settings, find Use Windows Hello when filling passwords. Click on the toggle to enable this feature, then enter your PIN code or use an alternate Windows Hello method to authenticate the change. The toggle will then move to the right and turn blue. After you\u2019ve turned on Windows Hello verification, a pop-up window will appear with an authentication check before Chrome will fill in your saved login info.

Why? You\u2019re safer from headaches if that Google account is ever compromised or lost. Plenty of excellent options exist, both free and paid \u2014 but the paid options offer nicer perks, like being able to give emergency access to your passwords, more sophisticated forms of two-factor authentication, and easier password sharing. These options can integrate with your phone and PC, so you can still seamlessly create, store, and use your credentials.

Beyond Windows Hello verification, you can also use antivirus software (like Avast One) to safeguard against malicious apps that try to steal saved browser passwords.

    "description": "Macworld Few computer-related disasters can quickly drain the color from your face quicker than losing a document you\u2019ve been busily working on. Whether your Mac crashed or froze, you forgot to save, or you accidentally clicked on delete, all might not be lost. We\u2019ll show you how you can recover that vanished Word document. If everything is working as it should then it\u2019s quite hard to lose a file in Word. Word has an autosave feature that means that in the event of an accident, you should still have the bulk of your work, except for the last ten minutes. Our top tip would be to save a document as soon as you start working on it to ensure that it autosaves regularly. But that\u2019s not why you\u2019re here. If you\u2019ve opened Word and can\u2019t find that document you were working on don\u2019t panic! There is a good chance that you can get your document back. In this article, we\u2019ll run through the various ways you can recover an unsaved or deleted Word document. How to recover an unsaved Word doc We\u2019ll run through a few scenarios that you might have been confronted with to recover that Word document for you. As we said above, the good news is that Word for Mac has a built-in autosave feature called AutoRecover. This means that Word is quietly saving the document you are working on without you needing to manually tell the software to do so. For this feature to function properly, however, you\u2019ll need to initially save the document with a name, and then Word will make incremental saves every ten minutes. However, even if you haven\u2019t done this Word will still save your document and you should be able to find a version of it in the AutoRecover folder. Below we will run through how to get to the AutoRecover folder and some other steps you can take to recover your document. Scenario 1: You are working on a Word document and you have to restart your Mac without a chance to save first Solution: Open Word again to see an autosaved version of your document. The good news is that if you are using an up-to-date version of Word then just opening up Word again should recover the document\u2014or at least a very recent version of it. This is because Word autosaves your document \u2013 even if you haven\u2019t saved it yet. This is even though at the top of the Window you will see an AutoSave button, which may be off. (Switch that button on and you\u2019ll see a request to save your document.) Scenario 2: Opening Word doesn\u2019t load up the document you were working on Solution: Find it in the AutoRecovery folder. Open the Finder. Click on Go in the menu. Click on Go To Folder. Paste in the following: ~/Library/Containers/com.microsoft.Word/Data/Library/Preferences/AutoRecovery This will open your AutoRecovery folder where you will find the AutoRecovery versions of your documents even though you didn\u2019t save them. Having found the document you may not be able to open it, in which case you may need to try the steps in the next scenario\u2026 Scenario 3: Word won\u2019t open the AutoRecovery version of your document Solution: Drag the file into a different text editor app When you try to open the AutoRecovery file (either by clicking on it or trying to drag it onto the Word icon in the Dock) you may see a message claiming that Word experienced an error trying to open the file. One of the suggestions may be to open the Text Recovery Converter. Here\u2019s what we did: Open TextEdit. Drag the file onto the TextEdit icon in the Dock. Copy the text into a new file in Word. Scenario 4: In a moment of madness you clicked on Don\u2019t Save or Delete Solution: Find the most recent version in the AutoRecovery folder The great news is that even if you didn\u2019t save your Word document \u2013 even the best of us have clicked Don\u2019t Save by accident when we were closing documents \u2013 you can recover it from the AutoRecovery folder. However, it is really difficult to locate as it is locked away in a hidden Library folder. Luckily there is a simple way to view that folder. Just click on Go > Go To Folder in the Finder\u2019s Go menu and paste the following: ~/Library/Containers/com.microsoft.Word/Data/Library/Preferences/AutoRecovery This will open your AutoRecovery folder where you will find the AutoRecovery versions of your documents even though you didn\u2019t save. If you are thinking you might be able to locate that folder directly in the Finder, notice that the ~ symbol means that it is a hidden folder, so it\u2019s easier to cut and paste the above address. Scenario 5: You made a mistake and want to go back to an older version Solution: Browser through recent versions It\u2019s not always the case that you lose the whole document. Sometimes you might lose some of the work you have done, which can be just as traumatic if you\u2019ve spent a lot of time on it. As long as you have made an initial save of the document you should be able to browse the version history: With the Word document open click on File. Select Browse Version History. In the right-hand column, you\u2019ll see the version history. Locate a version of the document from before you made the mistakes you wish to correct. Click on Open Version. This will open a second copy of your document. Either click on Restore (to go back to this version of the document) or Compare (if you don\u2019t want to recover the whole document and just want to copy and paste the bit you need). Other ways to recover a lost Word document If the above doesn\u2019t work, or your version of Word is older than the current one, try the steps we outline below. Check the Trash In some cases, your file might be missing because you deleted it. It\u2019s easily done when you are trying to make room on your Mac and you remove a load of old files only to realize that one of them was crucial. Luckily this isn\u2019t as disastrous as it sounds. The document might still be found in the Trash. Click on the Trash can icon in the Dock to open it. You\u2019ll now see the contents of the Trash. Look for your file. If you click on a file and press Space Bar you may be able to see a preview of it. If you don\u2019t see your file look for a \u2018Recovered Items\u2019 folder in the Trash. It\u2019s possible that your file is located in that. If it\u2019s there you\u2019ll need to right-click on it and choose Put Back. This will place the file back in the folder where it was originally saved and you can continue to work on it. Try data recovery software There are third-party apps that may be able to help you recover your document if the above advice doesn\u2019t help. Disk Drill Disk Drill will scan your storage for free and show you the files that can be recovered using the tool (so you don\u2019t have to pay before you know if it will be able to find your file). To recover the file you\u2019ll need to pay for the full version of Disk Drill here (\u00a383.28/$89). EaseUS EaseUS Data Recovery Wizard will scan the drive or volume where you lost the files. Once the scan is complete you can view Unsaved Documents. Double-click to see a preview of the file and click Recover to recover it. There is a free version that has a 2GB recovery limit, which may well be enough for your needs. Get it here. (Full version costs $69.95 a month, cancel at any time, or $99.95 a year) For details of some other apps that might help you recover your files, check out our round up of the best data recovery apps, which also includes Stellar Data Recovery, RecoverIt, Data Rescue. Find AutoRecovery for older versions of Word Since you might not have the latest bersion of Word we\u2019ll detail the steps below for you to follow to locate that Word AutoRecovery folder. How to find the AutoRecovery folder in Word 2016 Here\u2019s how to find AutoRecover in Word 2016: In Word 2016, the AutoRecovery folder is buried deep in the system and requires your Mac to display hidden files, so the first step is to reveal these secret folders, to do so we recommend following our advice at the link below, although the key combination to use is cmd + shift + . (full stop). Read: How to show hidden files and folders on a Mac. With this done you\u2019ll need to open Finder then click on the Home icon in the left-hand column (it\u2019s usually your name). Now navigate to the following folder: Library/Containers/com.microsoft.Word/Data/Library/Preferences/AutoRecovery/ If you have any AutoRecovery files then they will be in here. One thing to remember is that AutoRecovery files are temporary and only exist if they think that Word shut down unexpectedly. So, if you clicked Don\u2019t Save rather than Save when you were closing the document there won\u2019t be an AutoRecovery file for it. How to find the AutoRecovery folder in Word 2011 If you are using Word 2011 it\u2019s easy to locate the AutoRecovery folder: Click on the File option in the Menu bar then search for Autorecover. If you use Word often then there might be a few different Autorecover files, so check the date to see which one matches your missing item. Once you\u2019ve found the document just click on it to open it up, then remember to save it again under a new name. Even if you don\u2019t find your document in the AutoRecovery folder, it may not be the case that it isn\u2019t there. Files in the AutoRecover folder don\u2019t always show up. We have first-hand experience of this. In the past, our Mac has \u2018helpfully\u2019 saved a Word document in the Office 2011 AutoRecovery folder. This would not be an issue, except for the fact that when we then accessed the folder (just a quick search in Spotlight for Office 2011 AutoRecovery) the files were nowhere to be seen. As you can see from this screen grab, the most recent file in our AutoRecovery folder was from 5 March, but we know that there are more recent files saved there. The problem with the AutoRecovery file is that it is located in a Library folder that isn\u2019t visible by default, and that will have some impact on whether your files are visible or not. Fortunately, there is a way to locate the file. How to view files in Office 2011 AutoRecovery folder Go to the Finder, and press Alt (or Option) while selecting Go from the menu at the top of the page. This will make the Library folder visible (if you don\u2019t press Alt you won\u2019t see it \u2013 and you have to keep Alt pressed or it will vanish). Click on Library to open the Libray folder. Locate the following folder: Application Support > Microsoft > Office > Office 2011 AutoRecovery. When you see the Office 2011 in this view you should be able to locate your file. Recover old versions of documents via Time Machine While Word has its own Version History that only works if you have saved the file at some point. Plus, if you have subsequently deleted the document by accident you can\u2019t open it to open an older version. In that case, you could try Time Machine. If you have a Time Machine backup on an external drive you can roll back to a time when a deleted or corrupted file was still on your system. Go to the folder where you\u2019d hope to see your file, or an earlier version of your file. Open Time machine and flick back through the day, weeks or months to see if your file is there. We\u2019ll keep our fingers crossed for you. Follow our Complete guide to Time Machine for instructions on how to recover your files. If you are unfortunate enough not to have a backup routine then we suggest beginning one immediately. Macs are very reliable machines, but there is always a risk of something going wrong, so it\u2019s best to protect yourself against potential disaster. Try looking at our How to back up a Mac feature that highlights several solutions for this essential practice. What if you never saved your file \u2013 if in a moment of madness, you clicked on Don\u2019t Save rather than Save? It happens! Can you retrieve your file? Recover lost docs from the Temporary folder Your Mac also has a folder where it might temporarily keep files. The Temporary folder isn\u2019t easy to find though. To find the Temporary folder, use Terminal (find it in Applications > Utilities > Terminal, or Spotlight search for Terminal by pressing Command + Space. Open Terminal Type: open $TMPDIR Press Enter. Inside this TMP folder, you should find a folder called Temporaryitems. It\u2019s possible that your document might be inside. Tips to avoid lost Word files Avoid this nightmare happening again \u2013 follow the tips below. Save first, save often It goes without saying that you should save frequently especially if your Mac can be a bit unreliable. You may be able to rely on Word autosaving for you, but remember that you have to save the file first to really benefit from Autosave. Change the autosave frequency A helpful thing to know is that you can reduce the gaps between autosaves on Word for Mac. By default they are set at ten minute intervals, but it\u2019s easy to make them more frequent. In Word go up to the Menu bar at the top of the screen and click on Word. From the dropdown menu select Preferences and then in the Output and Sharing section you\u2019ll see a disk icon named Save. Click this and you\u2019ll now be able to adjust the time between saves by entering a value into the \u2018Save every X minutes\u2019 box at the bottom. While it might be tempting to set it as low as possible, bear in mind that Word\u2019s performance could be be hampered slightly if it\u2019s saving every minute, especially if you are working on a large file. Experiment to see what setting works best for you. You may also find one of these articles helpful: How to recover deleted files. Want to get to know Word better? Read our Top tips for Word for Mac.

    "description": "Another indie title has been released that\u2019s giving players some much-needed relaxation: Summerhouse. There\u2019s no combat, no movement, and nothing to stress you out except the limitations of your own imagination. Plus, there are collectibles, and that\u2019s always a good thing. Summerhouse, a game by independent developer Friederman, is all about building using a limited number of tiles and decor items. You start the game with only a few tiles to build with. As you place them down, you\u2019ll start to get new pieces featuring people and animals that will bring your creations to life--if you're lucky. Screenshot by Destructoid Summerhouse is about building houses and feeling the vibe Summerhouse is reminiscent of playing with building blocks, either as a child myself or with my daughter now. The possibilities are only limited by what you can imagine - you can build a giant castle or a tiny cottage, hang laundry between the windows and put climbing vines all over the walls. Or, if you feel like it, you can build a skyscraper that looks like it would topple over in reality. The limit does not exist. You technically don\u2019t even need walls. You can place windows, doors, and endless decor pieces wherever you like, as long as it's within the building boundaries set out by the level. There\u2019s no limit to how many objects you can place, so you can make incredibly cluttered designs that somehow end up looking as though they were always meant to look that way. At least, that\u2019s the hope. Screenshot by Destructoid Although Summerhouse lacks stress, it doesn\u2019t lack frustrations, though they have more to do with expectations vs reality than with the game itself. I\u2019ve played a lot of hours of Summerhouse, and I have found it difficult to create buildings that live up to the ideas I have in my head when starting a build. That said, I have, at times, begun to play and then somehow lost three hours before I look at the clock again. It\u2019s incredibly easy to get lost in the simple art style, and if you\u2019re not a fan of the default pixelated look, you can turn that off in the settings to give the game a smoother look. The wind blowing through the trees in the background and the quiet, calming music adds to the atmosphere, allowing you to simply relax and wile away the hours. Getting new building blocks in Summerhouse is not only easy but enjoyable, and some of them are absolutely adorable. For instance, by placing some power lines next to some swaying grass, two pieces that you have from the outset, you\u2019ll be rewarded with a new block featuring a little sheet ghost who comes to visit at night time. Screenshot by Destructoid You can make up your own stories for the people who show up, like the dog who sits on the steps waiting for his owner or the mysterious caller who stays on the pay phone all day. Summerhouse is a game of imagination, and it\u2019s got a shocking low base price on Steam of $4.99 USD. At that price, what have you got to lose?

    "description": "Ever since we started controlling our computers with a mouse, icons have been central to our operating systems. By clicking on small, simple images representing a folder, trash can, or magnifying glass, we can quickly and easily trigger certain events. The appearance of the icons is controlled by the operating system, and in most cases there is no reason to change. It would be impractical, for example, if the trash can suddenly resembled a calculator or the search tool became a folder. However, there are times when it is actually practical to change the appearance of the icons \u2014 for example, when it comes to your own folders and shortcuts. If you have a lot of icons, it can be more attractive and clearer if they don\u2019t all look the same. Many of us have an image memory, and if the folders have different colors, it will be easier to find them. Apple has realized this, and in a Mac it is easy to change the color of the folders. In Windows it\u2019s a bit more complicated, but it\u2019s possible. Choose your own image Yes, you don\u2019t even have to settle for a color change. You can freely choose what an icon should look like. For example, if you have a folder with documents related to a horse club you are a member of, you can replace the yellow folder icon with a picture of a horse. Similarly, you can create letter and number icons to quickly orientate yourself to the right folder. Or why not let the shortcuts to the web pages you often visit have the site\u2019s logo. The sky\u2019s the limit, but there is one important thing to keep in mind. When you change the icon on an image folder, the preview function disappears. If you use the regular default icon, you will also see thumbnails of the contents of the folder, but this works if you change the icon. Step by step 1. Open the settings Right-click on the folder or file you want to use and select Properties. If it\u2019s a folder, select the tab Customize and if it is a shortcut, click on the tab called Shortcut. Either way, you will now see an option called Change icon. Foundry 2. Change to a default icon You will now see the default icons that are built into the system, and what they are depends on what you want to change. Browse to the one you want to use, click on it and then select OK. Then press OK once more to confirm. Foundry 3. Use your own icons If you are not satisfied with any of the built-in icons, you can use a so-called ico-file. There are many sites where you can download these online and one of the best is Iconfinder: Browse to www.iconfinder.com and click on Icons. Foundry 4. Search for icons\u2026 On Iconfinder there are 6 million icons to choose from and you can find the right one by searching or browsing through categories. Some icons cost money, but when searching, you can tick Free to get only the free options. Foundry 5. \u2026and download them Once you\u2019ve found an icon you like, you can save it, but it\u2019s important that you choose the ico format. You can do this by clicking on Other > ICO and then selecting Download in ICO. Make sure to save the file in a place where you can find it. Foundry 6. Change icon Open icon Properties (as in step 1) and press Change icon. Select the Browse and locate your ico file. Press Open and a thumbnail of your icon will appear. Make sure it\u2019s highlighted and press OK twice. Now you can see how the old icon has been replaced by a new one. Foundry 7. Convert optional images\u2026 If you are not satisfied with the existing icons, you can create your own. You can take an existing image and convert it to the ico format. You can do this in image programs such as Xnview, but there are also websites that do this for free, such as Online Convert. 8. \u2026or create from scratch You can create your own icons using web services such as Favicons. This is a simple web-based drawing program for creating Windows icons. You can do this by drawing with your mouse or by importing an image file from your hard drive. When you are satisfied with the result, click on Download to save the image as an icon file. As you can see, Favicons is a slightly outdated service in terms of design.

    "description": "The rocky development of Blade has led to another shakeup for the Marvel Cinematic Universe movie. Actor Aaron Pierre isn't attached to the project anymore. Speaking with Variety over the weekend, Pierre explained that he's \"no longer part of that.\" He previously appeared in Old and will voice Mufasa in The Lion King prequel that's set to premiere this December. Pierre was one of a few names linked to Blade, which will star Oscar winner Mahershala Ali in the eponymous role. X and Pearl star Mia Goth reportedly joined the MCU movie almost a year ago. Shortly thereafter, True Detective creator Nic Pizzolatto was brought on to help with the script. But the Hollywood strikes put Blade on hold--along with most movies last summer. However, Blade faced a lot of setbacks previously as well.For instance, in 2022, Blade lost director Bassam Tariq just months before the film was set to go into production. That led to the vampire-centric movie getting shut down. Blade was originally announced in 2019 at San Diego Comic-Con.Late last year, Marvel shifted around a handful of movies, including Blade. While the movie was previously planned to premiere on Valentine's Day next year, Blade is currently slated to debut November 7, 2025. It sounds like Blade might be rated R, with new director Yann Demange hinting that it will follow in Deadpool 3's footsteps in that department.For more on the character, check out GameSpot's retrospective on 1998's Blade starring Wesley Snipes.",

    "description": "Gone are the days of backpacks overloaded with binders and the chronic hand-cramps from trying to write as fast as possible. Nowadays, a good laptop elevates your productivity and allows you to keep all your important lesson materials in one place. Whether you\u2019re new to campus or heading into your final year, having a laptop that\u2019s capable, sturdy, and portable \u2014 with good battery life, natch \u2014 will help keep you on top of your studies, or gaming (no judgement). Why you should trust us: It\u2019s in our name, PCWorld. We\u2019ve been reviewing laptops for decades, with exacting standards applied to all facets of the user experience, from performance benchmarks to features to the rigors of daily use. Our experts know their stuff and have curated a comprehensive list of the best laptops for college students, with their particular needs in mind. After you finish looking over our recommendations, be sure to hit our daily updated roundup of the best laptop deals to try and score your favorite laptops on sale. Or check out our roundup of the best laptops for even more recommendations. We\u2019ve also got a great article about the five laptop features that matter most. Updated March 18th, 2024: Since our last update, we\u2019ve published a number of laptop reviews, which we\u2019ll include below. We\u2019ve also added new sections as well as new pros and cons. The best ultraportable laptop for students pick was replaced by the Acer Swift Edge 16 and the MacBook Air (M3) was added as the best MacBook for students. MacBook Air (M3): The MacBook Air (M3) truly wowed us with its 19-hour battery life and spacious Liquid Retina display. It\u2019s also lightweight and portable, weighing in at just over three pounds. MacBook Pro (M3): The MacBook Pro (M3) Pro is considered a good work tool for everyday tasks thanks to the 11-core CPU and the 16-core Neural Engine. It also runs quiet and is noticeably faster than its predecessors. Alienware m16 R2: The Alienware m16 R2 is a \u201cdo it all\u201d 16-inch laptop for gamers who also want a portable PC with good battery life. Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon: The ThinkPad X1 Carbon (Gen 12) is an amazing business laptop with a lightweight form factor and a stunning display, but it comes at a premium price point compared to competing laptops. Samsung Galaxy Book3 Pro 360 \u2013 Best overall for students Pros Stunning OLED display Long battery life Solid inking 1080p webcam Good audio Cons Webcam effects are iffy Price When Reviewed: From $1,699.99 Best Prices Today: $969.99 at Amazon$1899.99 at SamsungNot Available at Best Buy Why we like the Samsung Galaxy Book3 The Samsung Galaxy Book Pro 360 offers a lot of goodies for the price ($1,699) such as a convertible form factor, a 1080p webcam, a superb OLED display, and long battery life. It also weighs just 3.66, so it\u2019s light enough to take with you from class to class. The 1080p webcam will make you look fine as heck during remote learning sessions and the 13.5 hours of battery life means you\u2019ll be able to keep working well into the evening hours. Everyday performance is snappy thanks to the Intel Core i7-1360P CPU and 16GB of memory, and the 16-inch AMOLED touch display features a resolution of 2880\u00d71800 and a refresh rate of 120Hz, resulting in vibrant visuals. This laptop really has it all. Who should buy the Samsung Galaxy Book3 Any college student that\u2019s looking for a well-rounded laptop. You can use it like a tablet for easy note taking or prop it up like a tent for sharing information or calling in for remote sessions. Multitasking is a real breeze thanks to the display\u2019s 16:10 aspect ratio, which means the screen is taller and more square than rectangular. While we like the way the 1080p webcam makes you look in video calls, some of the effects such as Eye Contact are finicky to use. Aside from a couple of minor nitpicks, we feel as though the Samsung Galaxy Book3 Pro 360 is the best choice for most people. Read our full Samsung Galaxy Book3 Pro 360 review Lenovo Flex 5i \u2013 Best Chromebook for students Pros Great build quality Vibrant touchscreen display Fast performance Nice typing experience Cons Stylus not included Average battery life for a Chromebook Heavier than expected Price When Reviewed: $499 Best Prices Today: $329 at Best Buy Why we like the Lenovo Flex The Lenovo Flex 5i is a great Chromebook because of its convertible design, fast performance, superb typing experience, and touchscreen display. The chassis has a luxurious aluminum finish on it, which makes it feel three or four times as expensive. The 360-degree hinge that connects the display to the rest of the laptops feels strong and like it won\u2019t wear out anytime soon. The keyboard is also a dream to type on and easy to adjust to, and the 1200p display produces sharp, colorful visuals. Sure, it\u2019s heavier than we expected right out of the box and the stylus isn\u2019t included, but those are small trade-offs in the grand scheme of things. Overall, this is a really well-rounded machine. Who should buy the Lenovo Flex We feel as though the Lenovo Flex 5i is a good option for those who prefer using Google\u2019s ecosystem. The beautiful touchscreen display and the convertible design really gives it the edge over other Chromebooks and even some Windows laptops, as you usually see those features in machines that cost much more. While the nine hour battery life is a little below average for a Chromebook, it\u2019ll still last you a full school day and then some. At the end of the day, the Lenovo Flex 5i\u2019s list of compromises is quite small. Read our full Lenovo Flex 5i Chromebook Plus review Acer Aspire 3 \u2013 Best budget laptop for students Pros Spacious keyboard with number pad HD webcam Solid video playback performance Decent business app performance Workday-long battery life Cons Small 128GB storage drive A little heavy Price When Reviewed: $329.99 Best Prices Today: $299.99 at Amazon Why we like the Acer Aspire For under $500, the Acer Aspire 3 laptop provides reliable performance as well as a durable build. It\u2019s zippy enough for day-to-day productivity like binging your favorite shows on Netflix, checking e-mail, and so on. There\u2019s even a full-sized keyboard and a 1080p screen. It even smashed the competition with a Cinebench R15 score of 1,925, edging out the Acer Aspire Vero 14, which has comparable hardware. By the way, the Cinebench benchmark measures how well a laptop handles processor-intensive workloads. Who should buy the Acer Aspire Anyone who\u2019s on a restricted budget! To get more specific, we feel as though the Acer Aspire 3 is a good option for students because it\u2019s affordable and a good performer. The HD webcam also produces \u201cclean, crisp video\u201d according to our review, which means you\u2019ll always look your best in remote learning sessions. The 40 watt-hour battery is quite good too, lasting a total of eight hours on a single charge, so you don\u2019t have to stop and go outlet hunting as you\u2019re traversing from class to class. Read our full Acer Aspire 3 review MacBook Air (M3) \u2013 Best MacBook for students Pros Excellent battery life Great combination of price, features, and performance 256GB SSD is now two NAND chips, maintaining performance Cons Expensive memory upgrades Dual external display support requires closed lid Price When Reviewed: $1,299 (base) Best Prices Today: $1,234 at Amazon$1299 at Adorama$1299 at Apple Why we like the MacBook Air From the outstanding battery life to the spacious Liquid Retina display, the MacBook Air (M3) received high marks across the board. It comes with an 8-core CPU (M3) and a 10-core GPU as well as two Thunderbolt 4 ports and a 66.5 watt-hour battery. Performance is similar to the MacBook Pro (M3), which means it can blitz through school work and casual use tasks. The only difference between the two is that the MacBook Air doesn\u2019t have fans, resulting in quieter operation. This laptop also managed a whopping 19 hours on a single charge, which is great news for those with jam-packed schedules and have zero time to plug into the nearest outlet. Who should buy the MacBook Air Anyone who prefers MacOS over other operating systems! The battery life is incredible and the laptop itself weighs just a little over three pounds, which means you can easily take it anywhere with you. The 15-inch Liquid Retina (LED) screen is considered a step-down from the MacBook Pro\u2019s Liquid Retina XDR (mini-LED) display, but that doesn\u2019t mean it doesn\u2019t look great, especially for everyday use. The $1,299 price tag is also reasonable for the performance and features. However, the 8GB of RAM is a little light. Acer Swift Edge 16 \u2013 Best ultraportable for students Pros Gorgeous OLED display Lightweight Strong CPU performance Cons Mediocre battery life Weak audio Average keyboard and touchpad Price When Reviewed: $1,299.99 Best Prices Today: $949.99 at Best Buy$1,299.99 at Amazon Why we like the Acer Swift Edge In addition to its lightweight form factor, the Acer Swift Edge 16 is also the perfect combination of affordable and powerful. This sub-$1,000 laptop weighs just 2.71 pounds and is capable of out-performing machines that cost hundreds of dollars more (like the Acer Swift Go 16) due to the AMD Ryzen 7 7840U CPU. The 2000p OLED machine is lovely, too. According to our review, it \u201cdelivers an infinite contrast ratio and deep, inky black levels that produce convincing shadows in dark scenes.\u201d Whether you\u2019re watching your favorite flicks or working on an important assignment, you can count on a gorgeous picture either way. Who should buy the Acer Swift Edge If you\u2019re looking for a lightweight ultraportable with strong performance, the sub-$1,000 Acer Swift Edge 16 is the one to pick. It\u2019s thin and light enough to toss in a bag, and the display is fantastic for school work or watching YouTube. The 54 watt-hour battery is rather small, but it still manages a respectable seven hours on a single charge. For under a grand, we believe the trade-offs are reasonable. Besides, you won\u2019t find many large screen laptops at this price point. Read our full Acer Swift Edge 16 review Asus TUF Gaming A16 Advantage Edition \u2013 Best budget gaming laptop for students Pros Impressive battery life Gorgeous 16:10 display Rugged chassis Cons Keys feel a bit soft 720p webcam is disappointing Price When Reviewed: $1,099.99 Best Prices Today: $949.99 at Best Buy Why we like the Asus TUF Gaming The Asus TUF Gaming A16 Advantage Edition is something of a rare gem in the sand dune. This specific model exhibits strong graphics performance as well as long battery life, which is unusual for a gaming laptop. Most gaming laptops last only a couple of hours on a single charge. Well, the Asus TUF Gaming A16 Advantage Edition and its 11 and a half hours of battery life is out here changing the script. That\u2019s more than a full school day. Also, thanks to the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4050 GPU, it also managed 123 frames-per-second in the Rise of the Tomb Raider benchmark. That\u2019s pretty darn good, especially for a sub-$1,000 gaming laptop. Who should buy the Asus TUF Gaming The Asus TUF Gaming A16 Advantage Edition is a great option for those who like to game after class. The pricing is reasonable and you\u2019re getting reliable graphics performance as well as a spacious keyboard and decent battery life. It\u2019s also a good purpose machine, so you can use it for coursework and day-to-day productivity. With a solid Cinebench R20 score of 589, it should have \u201cno trouble running lightweight apps and programs,\u201d according to our review. The Lenovo LOQ 15, which we reviewed recently, stands as another solid budget option. It\u2019s more than capable of 1080p gaming thanks to its more powerful RTX 4060 and the design is very sci-fi inspired. That said, it didn\u2019t nab the top pick because of the poor battery life (not unusual for a gaming laptop) and limited port selection. Read our full Asus TUF Gaming A16 Advantage Edition review How we tested The PCWorld team puts each and every Windows laptop through a series of benchmarks that test GPU and CPU performance, battery life, and so on. The idea is to push the laptop to its limits and then compare it against others we\u2019ve tested. Chromebooks, on the other hand, go through a series of web-based tests. It wouldn\u2019t be fair or possible to run the same kinds of tests on a Chromebook, as they\u2019re Chrome OS-based machines. Below, you\u2019ll find a breakdown of each test and the reasons why we run them. For a much deeper look at our review methodology, check out how PCWorld tests laptops. Windows laptops PCMark 10: PCMark 10 is how we determine how well the laptop handles lighter tasks like web browsing, word processing, spreadsheets, and so on. HandBrake: HandBrake is more intensive than PCMark 10. It basically measures how long a laptop\u2019s CPU takes to encode a beefy 30GB file. Cinebench: Cinebench is a brief stress test of the CPU cores. It does this by rendering a 2D scene over a short period of time. 3DMark: 3DMark checks if 3D performance remains consistent over time by running graphic-intensive clips. Video rundown test: To gauge battery life, we loop a 4K video using Windows 10\u2019s Movies & TV app until the laptop dies. Chromebooks CrXPRT 2: The CrXPRT 2 benchmark tests a Chromebook\u2019s battery life. Speedometer 2.0: This test determines a Chromebook\u2019s web browser performance. It simulates this by adding, completing, and removing a to-do list. Basemark Web 3.0: This benchmark gauges how well a Chromebook can handle web-based applications. Kraken 1.1: Kraken 1.1 is a JavaScript performance benchmark. Jetstream 2: Jetstream 2 is a combination of WebAssembly and JavaScript benchmarks. This is a way to gauge how well a Chromebook runs advanced workloads. What to look for in a laptop for college The first thing to consider is budget. How much are you willing to spend on a laptop? If you\u2019re working with an inflexible budget, Chromebooks are a good option. They\u2019re affordable and designed to handle everyday tasks like writing papers, working on spreadsheets, and so on. Chromebook prices can range anywhere from $200 up to $1,000. If you want to spend a bit more, laptops with convertible touchscreens (otherwise known as 2-in-1s) offer a great deal of functionality. You can flip the screen around and use it like a tablet or prop it up like an easel for watching movies. Things like navigating your e-mail or watching Netflix will require more RAM. We recommend springing for 8GB of RAM or more. 4GB of RAM is fine and good for web browsing and basic office work, but 8GB is better for having more tabs open and whatnot. Plus, applications like Google Chrome and Spotify tend to eat up a lot of memory. Most people can get by with 4GB in a pinch if you\u2019re on a tight budget, but you won\u2019t be able to multitask as much. The final thing is a decent keyboard. In college, you\u2019re going to be spending a lot of time typing. Depending on your personal preference, you may want either a full or short travel keyboard. Mechanical keyboards, for example, normally have longer travel. This helps prevent accidental keystrokes. The keys also give a lot of tactile feedback, as they bounce back after they\u2019re pressed down. FAQ 1. Which laptop size is best? This is mostly personal preference. Students who bring their laptops to class or intend to travel a lot should consider a smaller, more portable size. Anything in the neighborhood of 13- to 14-inches is recommended. However, if you want to use your laptop for gaming, then you should consider something in the 15- to 17-inch range. It\u2019s also important to keep in mind the weight of the laptop before buying it. Ultra thin laptops can weigh a featherlight two pounds while hefty gaming rigs top the scales at three or four times that\u2014not exactly something you want to carry in a backpack everyday. 2. How long should a laptop last on a single charge? If you\u2019ve got a jam-packed schedule, you\u2019ll probably be running from class to class with very little downtime in between. That\u2019s why we recommend a laptop with a long-lasting battery. We recommend something that\u2019ll last 7 to 10-plus hours on a single charge, unless you want a notebook that can play games on the side\u2014gaming laptops are notorious for their shorter endurance, even during everyday tasks. That 7 to 10 hours is a good figure if you plan on taking your laptop with you everywhere. 3. What about processing power? Most students will be able to get by with an Intel Core i3 or i5 processor. You don\u2019t need anything mega powerful for everyday tasks and school work. However, if you\u2019re using more graphically demanding programs on the regular, then you may want to spring for an Intel Core i7 or i9. It all really depends on your workload.

    "description": "The 2004 Dawn of the Dead remake, written by James Gunn and directed by Zack Snyder (in his directorial debut!), celebrates its 20th anniversary this week. Both critically praised and commercially successful at the time of its release, the film, along with 28 Days Later, helped popularize the concept of sprinting zombies over their shambling, slouching, Romero-made counterparts. They created panic and urgency, and they made for an opening sequence that was worth the price of admission by itself.Like many great horror films, Dawn of the Dead doesn't start with horror. Our main character, Ana, is a nurse, and she's wrapping up a long shift at the hospital. What's great about this opening sequence--of her talking with co-workers and killing time--is how mundane it is. This is not load-bearing dialogue, and the actors don't deliver it theatrically, as if to imply narrative stakes. We know that Ana is about to have the worst day of her life. But she doesn't know that. Nothing feels urgent or pressing, because from her perspective, it isn't.She doesn't know it's the last time she's going to see her co-worker, or the neighborhood girl, or her husband. Even the shower sex between them, tastefully filmed behind the steaming glass, feels domestic and perfunctory.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "At a GlanceExpert's Rating ProsNow supports Apple SiliconNew Guided Edits, with new Search toolMoving elements add animation to still photosConsNew mobile and web apps still in betaExpensiveOur VerdictThe 2024 Photoshop Elements update breathes new life into the app and is a good upgrade for owners of previous versions. It also confirms Photoshop Elements\u2019 position as one of the leading photo-editors for non-professional users. Price When Reviewed$99.99 Best Prices Today: Adobe Photoshop Elements Retailer Price Macworld Software Store $69.99 View Deal Adobe $99.99 View Deal Macworld Software Store \u2013 Elements/Premiere Bundle $109.99 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket Photoshop Elements isn\u2019t the cheapest photo editor available, costing $99.99/\u00a386.56, but it\u2019s still great value for money as it\u2019s able to use technology from the professional version of Photoshop to provide some really powerful tools for editing your photos and adding creative effects. Adobe also sells a bundle that includes both Photoshop Elements and Premiere Elements for video editing for $149.99/\u00a3130.36, which can save you even more money. (Read our review of Premiere Elements.) The key to Photoshop Elements\u2019 success is that it manages to combine powerful editing tools with a user-friendly interface that makes it easy for amateur photographers to achieve impressive results. Adobe\u2019s 2022 version introduced new artificial intelligence techniques \u2013 which Adobe refers to as Sensei \u2013 which could automatically perform editing tasks that might normally require hours of work. Further reading: 5 free Photoshop alternatives for Windows The app has always had a selection of filter effects that could make photos look like paintings, using media such as oil paints or watercolors, but Sensei introduced a new set of Artistic effects that aim to mimic a variety of popular artistic styles, such as cubist and post-impressionist. These aren\u2019t always entirely successful \u2013 I suspect Vincent Van Gogh is spinning in his grave right now \u2013 but they\u2019re fun to experiment with. One nice touch here is that you can apply the artistic effect to the entire photo, or just to the subject or background, which is a nice way of emphasizing particular aspects of a photo. If your artistic ambitions are a little more modest you can apply some simple animated effects \u2013 known as Overlays \u2013 such as falling snowflakes or flickering flames, to your photos and then save your work as a short video clip that you can upload to social media. One of the things that sets Photoshop Elements apart from many of its rivals is its use of Guided Edits, which give you step-by-step help in using some of the app\u2019s most powerful tools. One really powerful Guided Edit that was introduced in 2021\u2019s update is the ability to alter the aspect ratio of a photo by extending the background of a photo. If you\u2019ve got a photo with an attractive background, such as a beach or some leafy trees then you can clone part of the background and use it to extend the background further \u2013 perhaps to turn a square photo into a wider landscape shot, or to extend a sunny blue sky upwards for an upright portrait shot that you can use on social media. And, of course, no social media account is complete without some cute pet pics, so Photoshop Elements includes a Guided Edit specifically for enhancing photos of animals. You can adjust the lighting and color in a photo, focusing either on your pet or the background, or add a subtle vignette effect. There\u2019s also an option to remove blemishes, such as mud or dirt, and to remove glare from the pet\u2019s eyes. The use of Sensei artificial intelligence continued with Photoshop Elements 2023. As well as applying animated overlays to an entire photo, this feature allows you to create moving elements that animate just one specific section within a photo. You could select part of an image, such as a waterfall or the flowing mane of a horse, and animate your selection to make the image look more dynamic and eye-catching. The program\u2019s selection tools can help you to select either the background of an image, or elements in the foreground, and you can simply draw a line to indicate the direction of movement (so the waterfall flows down, rather than upwards). You can also adjust settings such as the speed of movement, and preview the animation effect before exporting the animated image file as an MP4 video clip or as an animated-GIF. The Guided Edits section of the program also gained new tools for adding overlays, new background images, or enhancing the appearance of the sky in your photos. And, with so many Guided Edits now available, we were pleased to see that this update added a new Search tool that helps you to quickly locate the Guided Edits you need by searching for keywords such as \u2018crop\u2019 or \u2018sky\u2019. Adobe Adobe Adobe For Mac users, the most important feature in Photoshop Elements 2023 was its native support for Apple Silicon, with Adobe claiming that the program will now run 45 percent faster on Macs that have M1 or M2 processors. And if that wasn\u2019t enough to persuade you to upgrade, then this year\u2019s new Photoshop Elements 2024 proves to be one of the biggest updates the program has received in quite a few years. As you might expect, there are a number of new AI features, but the program\u2019s interface and layout have also been \u201crefreshed and redesigned\u201d too. Like the full version of Photoshop, the Elements version now has both Light and Dark modes, as many experienced photographers prefer working in Dark mode, while other people simply find it easier on the eyes. The various fonts and icons used in the main interface have also been updated to improve visibility too. These interface changes are more than just cosmetic, though, with other useful features such as the new Quick Actions panel, which is now available within the program\u2019s Quick editing mode. The Quick Actions panel gathers together a number of existing editing tools, but also gains new AI features, such as the ability to quickly select or change the background or sky in an image, or to smooth out fuzzy artefacts in compressed JPG files. Adobe Adobe Adobe One of the headline features in Photoshop Elements 2024 is Match Color, which is available within the FX panel in both Quick mode and the Advanced mode for experienced users. In Quick mode you can simply choose a number of presets that allow you to quickly change the colours and tonal balance within a photo, while Advanced mode also allows you to import your own photos and copy the colour settings from one photo to another. And, when you\u2019re working in Advanced mode, you can use a new Search tool to browse through Adobe\u2019s library of free stock photography to find images that you can use in your own work. This year\u2019s update also gains a new Guided Edit called Add Text, which makes it easier to use the program\u2019s text tools and effects. You can quickly add horizontal or vertical text, apply text to a selection, or make text follow a path that you draw with a freehand pen. You can add drop shadows, graduated colours and other effects with a quick click of your mouse, and even change the angle of lighting that you apply to the text. And, for social media mavens, there\u2019s a new Photo Reels tool, which is similar to an old-fashioned slide-show that flicks through a series of photos, but is very much focused on social media and provides a series of templates for use on Instagram, Tiktok and other services. When you create a Photo Reel you see a simple timeline view that allows you to arrange photos in sequence, adjust the size and aspect ratio of each photo. You can also adjust the playback speed of the photo reel, and add text, graphics and filter effects. Foundry Foundry Foundry Buying the desktop version of Photoshop Elements also gives you access to its companion mobile app for iOS and Android, and a web app that runs in a browser on any device. The mobile app allows you to upload photos and videos from your smartphone or tablet, and also provides you with 2GB of free online storage for your files. You can then quickly import these files into the desktop versions of Photoshop Elements when you\u2019re ready to get down to some serious editing work. The web app works in a similar fashion, and also includes some simple tools for quickly creating slideshows and collages without having to use the full version of Photoshop Elements. Just remember that both the mobile and web apps are still in their beta test phase, so make sure you keep backups of your photos and files just in case. All these new features ensure that Photoshop Elements 2024 is a much more worthwhile upgrade than some versions in recent years. Pricing is unchanged, at $99.99/\u00a386.56 when bought directly from Adobe, but there\u2019s a 30-day trial available so that you can experiment for a while before buying. Verdict In recent years, some of Photoshop Elements\u2019 annual upgrades were starting to look as though they were running out of ideas, but the 2024 update breathes new life into the app and is definitely a good upgrade for owners of previous versions. It also confirms Photoshop Elements\u2019 position as one of the leading photo editors for non-professional users. This review originally published on Macworld.com. Mac, MacOS, Personal Software",

    "description": "It sounds too good to be true. The ability to smoke meats, seafood and more inside your kitchen without risking your security deposit doesn\u2019t seem like something that should be possible. GE Appliances begs to differ. The company debuted the final version of its GE Profile Smart Indoor Smoker just before CES, quickly nabbing the attention of this wood-fired-grill reviewer. Thanks to a unique filtration system, the unit captures smoke while cooking and only expels warm air (out of the front). After getting a small taste (literally one bite) in Vegas of what the smoker could do, I\u2019ve spent the last few weeks cooking a variety of proteins to see if the $999 device is as compelling as it seems. Design The GE indoor smoker has the stature of a small mini fridge. It\u2019s not far off from the quick-cooking ovens behind the counter at Starbucks either. Its glossy front is two-thirds door, complete with viewing window, while the remaining space is dedicated to the control panel and pellet waste bin. Up top is a small sliding door at the front left for adding food-grade wood pellets. The sides and back look plain and boring, like a countertop oven or microwave, but that\u2019s just fine. The contraption is short enough to fit under cabinets, but you\u2019ll want to leave space on the sides and back for radiant heat. At the bottom of the front, there\u2019s a vent where the GE indoor smoker expels warm air while it\u2019s cooking. The company also provides a small drip tray that slides under the front edge to help keep your counter clean. Over to the right, a display sits up top to show you status, probe temperature, smoker temperature, cook time and smoke level. You turn a knob to navigate settings and menus and then press to confirm your choices. Back and Start buttons flank that dial on the left and right sides respectively. There\u2019s progress and status lights that encircle the knob too, adding a visual cue during preheating, cooking and more. Under the knob is a smattering of buttons to get to certain functions quickly. These include settings, cancel, the interior light, activating the Clear Smoke feature and toggling between probe temperature and cooking time on the display. There\u2019s also a power switch in this group and they\u2019re all touch-based rather than clicky physical buttons. Inside, supports snap onto the sides to hold the three moveable racks in place. A drip pan slides into the bottom to catch grease and other debris. To keep tabs on food temps, a probe snaps into a jack at the top right of the cooking chamber and can be stored on the outside of the smoker via a magnetic holder when not in use. Lastly, the GE Profile Smart Indoor Smoker\u2019s prime piece of tech, the Active Smoke Filtration system, is on the back interior wall. Setup and use Photo by Billy Steele/Engadget Another benefit of the GE indoor smoker is that it\u2019s ready to go out of the box. There\u2019s no seasoning or burn-off required to get rid of oils or other manufacturing leftovers. Simply snap the rack supports in place, slide in the racks, put the drip pan in the bottom and that\u2019s it for the cooking chamber. Once you add pellets in the slot up top and fill the water tank to the indicated level, the smoker is almost ready to start cooking. One more step you\u2019ll need to do the first time you cook, or anytime you empty the pellet chute, is to prime the auger. This ensures that the device will start producing smoke quickly and efficiently, giving your food as much time as possible to bathe in it. Afterwards, you can choose a preset or opt to go full manual mode (called Customize) and you\u2019re off and running. GE has dialed-in selections for brisket, pork ribs, pork butt, wings, chicken and salmon. These offer the necessary time and temperature settings for proper cooking, including a recommended smoke level. Additionally, you can determine the duration of the cook based on time or internal food temperature. Once either of those are achieved, the GE Profile Smart Indoor Smoker can automatically go into Keep Warm mode until you\u2019re ready to eat. Photo by Billy Steele/Engadget A word on larger cuts: you\u2019ll need to portion them out in order to make them fit. For things like ribs and brisket, you can easily slice them in half and make use of the rack system. I did chuckle when reading the recipe book as GE says you can fit a 18-pound brisket in this smoker. That single cut of beef would take up most of the cooking area on some pellet grills, so you definitely have to cut it to fit here. And even then, the pieces will be quite large. Pork butts fit with ease, as do whole chickens. If you prefer to spatchcock your birds to cook them, that won\u2019t work here. However, you could easily do two chicken halves. I was also able to accommodate nearly four pounds of wings (flats and drums) across the three racks. Basically, any meat you\u2019d smoke on an outdoor grill can be done on this unit, but some of them will take a bit of extra planning, and maybe a few cuts, to get them to fit. How does the GE Indoor Smoker work? After you\u2019ve selected your preset or manually entered your cooking parameters and pressed start, the GE indoor smoker will ask you to confirm that you\u2019ve added both pellets to the chute and water to the waste bin. From there, the device will preheat to the appropriate temperature before it begins producing any smoke. This will allow you to put your food inside without having to clear the smoke immediately. The last step is to push the start dial once more to begin the smoking process. Before you open the door while things are cooking, you\u2019ll need to activate the Clear Smoke function to avoid setting off any alarms in your kitchen. This takes 10 minutes, so you\u2019ll have to plan ahead a bit \u2013 unless you don\u2019t mind smoking up the room. I mention this because you will have to flip and rotate nearly everything you prepare in this thing to make sure it cooks evenly. I learned this lesson the hard way with a pork butt that burned on top but was undercooked near the bone. A simple flip and front-to-back rotation for everything about half-way through the process remedied the issue for everything I cooked after that, but it is an extra step that outdoor grills don\u2019t require. You can leave a pork butt on a pellet grill unbothered until it\u2019s done, but those have fans pushing heat around the cooking chamber. GE says it didn\u2019t opt for a convection fan in this unit because of how it would\u2019ve affected the flow of smoke. Can you taste the smoke? One of the biggest questions I had about the GE indoor smoker is if you\u2019d actually be able to taste the smoke. The unit burns just enough wood pellets to fill the cooking chamber with smoke, which is enough to give proteins a kiss of flavor. It\u2019s certainly not as intense as what you get on an outdoor grill, but it\u2019s definitely there. Since the GE Profile Smart Indoor Smoker does an excellent job of regulating temperature, the texture of all of those meats, and even seafood, is consistently moist and tender. Smoke flavor was most prominent in wings, chicken and salmon, but I could taste it in larger cuts of meat, too. GE allows you to adjust the smoke level from 0 to 5, so you can crank it all the way up to maximize the flavor if that\u2019s your culinary preference. I almost always set it to level 5. Let\u2019s talk about smoke rings One thing you won\u2019t see on meat cooked low-and-slow in the GE Profile Smart Indoor Smoker is a smoke ring. This is the pink area along the outside of sliced meats that most people think indicates how well smoke has penetrated the food. That\u2019s actually a misconception. A smoke ring is caused by a chemical reaction with nitric oxide gas produced by burning wood or charcoal. It isn\u2019t by any means an indication of the level of smoke flavor, or even good barbecue. Outdoor pellet grills, offset smokers and even a Weber kettle with charcoal will create a noticeable smoke ring on things like ribs, pork butts and briskets. The GE Profile Smart Indoor Smoker will not. That\u2019s because the appliance isn\u2019t burning wood pellets as the heat source \u2013 it\u2019s only using them to flavor the food. That takes very little fuel, and it also requires barely any heat to smolder them. You can actually fake a smoke ring if you really want one for the \u2018gram, but overdoing it can ruin your food, so tread carefully. For that, you\u2019ll need a small amount of something that contains sodium nitrate and sodium nitrite, like Morton\u2019s Tender Quick. It\u2019s the stuff that\u2019s used to cure pastrami, where the pink color is essential. Cleanup and maintenance Photo by Billy Steele/Engadget Unlike most outdoor grills, all of the racks and rack supports inside the GE Profile Smart Indoor Smoker are dishwasher safe \u2013 simply by virtue of being small enough to fit. Since you\u2019ll have to wipe down the interior of the cooking chamber with a solution of either mild soap and water or vinegar and water, not having to hand-wash what\u2019s sure to be the dirtiest part of the machine is a plus. The drip pan is made out of a similar material to roasting pans you\u2019d use in an oven, so you can probably stick it in the dishwasher too. I have been doing this with no issues so far, but you can always wrap it in foil before you start smoking for easy cleaning. You\u2019ll also need to empty the water tank that collects and extinguishes the spent pellets after each use, though the smoker may ask you to do so midway through longer sessions. You\u2019ll need to strain out the remaining wood particles from the water before discarding the cooled solids in the trash. Since the water container doesn\u2019t touch any food, a quick wipe and rinse is all that\u2019s needed here. GE says you\u2019ll occasionally need to clean the pellet ramp to ensure proper smoke production. The company includes a small brush that\u2019s used to keep unwanted debris out of the cooking chamber. Simply lift the smoke inlet cover on the right side of the cooking area and use the brush to remove anything that\u2019s accumulated there. The company also recommends that you wipe the interior light after each use. I assume that\u2019s so you\u2019ll be able to see well during the cooking process, but GE doesn\u2019t elaborate on why you need to do it. GE Profile SmartHQ app The Smart Indoor Smoker works with GE\u2019s SmartHQ app to allow you to monitor the small appliance over Wi-Fi. With this software, you can monitor smoker and food temperatures from anywhere, as well as activate the 10-minute Clear Smoke process from the sofa. The app also lets you turn the internal light on and off, but that\u2019s really about it. You can\u2019t actually adjust the smoker temperature without walking over to it. The smoker comes with a recipe book, but it would\u2019ve been great if those (and many more) were available inside the app. Those instructions, paired with the ability to send the appropriate cooking info to the device, would give new users a lot of ways to get started beyond the simple protein-specific presets. I would also love it if there was a way to trigger the Keep Warm function or shut down the smoker remotely. You know, for the times when I get too excited about putting pulled pork in my mouth and forget to turn the machine off before sitting down at the table. Is it better than an outdoor grill? Photo by Billy Steele/Engadget While it\u2019s tempting to compare the results from the GE Profile Smart Indoor Smoker to those of a pellet, charcoal or wood-burning grill, it would be like discussing apples and oranges. Since all of the other options have an open flame and use significantly more fuel as the primary heat source, the smoke flavor is much more intense. They also require a lot more planning. First, you\u2019d need dedicated outdoor space where those grills and smokers will be safe to use. You\u2019ll also need to consider the added cleaning and maintenance needed to keep them running well. All of these outdoor grills have a wider temperature range, so they can be used for more than just smoking. You could use a pellet grill, for example, to do everything from brisket to searing steaks. Ditto for charcoal or wood-burning units. And if you factor in Wi-Fi-enabled features, outdoor grills typically allow you to adjust temperature in addition to just monitoring it. Some of them even offer advanced tools like the Super Smoke mode from Traeger or the ability to send recipes to the grill as part of step-by-step guidance. All this considered, the GE Profile Smart Indoor Smoker is still a good option for people who can\u2019t have an outdoor smoker due to rental agreements or a lack of space. You\u2019ll certainly need to plan ahead on how to store the appliance when you\u2019re not using it. But, the fact that you can put it in your kitchen opens up the ability to cook barbecue, smoked wings, tasty seafood and more that you otherwise wouldn\u2019t be able to. It\u2019s not entirely a \u201cset it and forget it\u201d type of device, and there are some hoops to jump through in terms of rotating things during the cook. However, you won't have to spend hours babying the meats the cooking starts. Wrap-up The GE Profile Smart Indoor Smoker works just like the company describes. The only real nuisance is having to flip and rotate foods to make sure they\u2019re cooked properly. I really wish the company was more up-front about this somewhere other than the troubleshooting table and recipe book. It\u2019s a key action that shouldn\u2019t be left to trial and error. Even with that caveat, the device produces noticeably smoky flavor in a range of foods, albeit in a more-subdued way than what an outdoor grill. Presets make it easy to get started and the manual mode will provide an open playground once you gain some experience. This won\u2019t replace your pellet or charcoal grill, but that\u2019s not really the point. It lets people who can\u2019t own one of those make some tasty barbecue inside their kitchens. You just have to find a place to store it, or give up previously allocated countertop space, between smoke sessions.

    "description": "Amazon's Big Spring Sale has brought a $30 discount to the company's upgraded e-reader, the Kindle Paperwhite Signature. It's down to $160 instead of the $190 list price for Prime members. That's not an all-time low (we saw it drop to $125 for Prime Day last July) but still a decent discount on a device that doesn't go on sale very often. Engadget's Nathan Ingraham called the Paperwhite Signature the \"best e-reader. Period.\" when he reviewed it upon its debut a couple years ago. The Paperwhite Signature Edition is an upgrade over the standard Kindle: It has a larger, 6.8-inch screen, 32GB of storage, auto-adjusting warm front lights and wireless charging capabilities. It also comes standard without lockscreen ads \u2014 it costs $20 to disable those on other Kindles. In his review, Nathan particularly appreciated the premium feel of the device. The flush-front touchscreen is responsive, quickly recognizing taps and swipes with little lag when typing on the on-screen keyboard. The bottom bezel is a good size for keeping a grip on the reader, but the thin bezels on the sides give plenty of room for the 300 pixel-per-inch content. The warm front lights adjust in response to the light in the room and can also be programmed to shift to a more amber hue at night.

    "description": "FFVII Rebirth takes second place in Feb.Helldivers 2 is the best-selling video game of 2024 so far in the USA. Full stop. Done. Accounting for both physical and digital purchases, Circana data places it at the top of the sales charts for both February 2024 and the year so far. The unexpected hit is said to have sold more than eight million copies, but that stat will have increased since. The PS5, PC title beat out competition from Final Fantasy VII Rebirth to land top spot for the month, though the Square Enix sequel did release on the final day of February.With its full launch in early February, Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League was the seventh best-selling game of the month in the USA while Skull and Bones beat it in fourth. Funnily, a twin pack of Final Fantasy VII Remake and Rebirth managed to chart in the eighth spot. To make way for the new releases, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 slipped to third, Tekken 8 found itself in fifth, and Persona 3 Reload dropped to ninth.Read the full article on pushsquare.com",

    "description": "When you connect your laptop to a wireless network, you usually have to log in with a password. This is true in caf\u00e9s and libraries, for example \u2013 but also when we are in our own or someone else\u2019s home. This login only has to be done once and the next time you connect, the computer will remember the password. get windows 11 pro for cheap Windows 11 Pro Price When Reviewed: 199.99 Best Prices Today: $59 at PCWorld Store \u2013 Win 11 Pro Upgrade Only | $79.99 at PCWorld Software Store The problem is that this happens automatically without you being able to see the password in plain text. If you have forgotten your password and want to connect your mobile phone, tablet or any other computer to the same network, this automation can be a disadvantage. The same applies if you want to help someone else sign into your Wi-Fi network. To view the passwords you have saved on your computer, you can use a classic free program called Wireless Keyview. But if you have Windows 11, you don\u2019t actually need to get this program; you can find the password via the Windows 11 settings menu. Here\u2019s how to do it: Open the Settings via the Start button in the bottom left corner or by pressing the Windows+I. Select Network and Internet in the left-hand menu and then click Wi-Fi. Go to Properties for your network and scroll down. To the right of Show Wi-Fi security key is the button View. Press it and you will see the password in plain text on the screen. You may need to re-enter your Windows 11 password before seeing the password. This article was translated from Swedish to English and originally appeared on pcwelt.de. Windows",

    "description": "Macworld While the higher-end MacBooks with M1/M2/M3 Pro and Max chips support multiple external displays, the majority of Apple\u2019s lower-end range of MacBooks that use a standard M1, M2 or M3 processor cannot natively connect more than one external monitor. This is a massive limitation compared to the previous Intel-based generation of Mac laptops that could run two displays when connected to a USB-C or Thunderbolt 3 docking station or hub. Apple\u2019s latest M3 MacBook Air models do now support two external monitors (if the MacBook has its lid closed), but not the older M3 MacBook Pro, even though it boasts an HDMI port unlike the Air models. The solutions below, however, allow for more than two external displays. There have also been reports that M3 MacBook Air with lid closed suffers significant performance decline due to heat build up, so following our advice below still has relevance even for M3 MacBook Air users, Later, we list our tested and recommended software and hardware solutions for adding more than one display to the plain M1, M2 and M3 Macs. These solutions will also help M2 Pro and M3 Pro MacBook users extend to three external displays. Here are the external display specs for Apple\u2019s current laptops: M1 MacBook Air: Maximum one external display\u2014read our workarounds below. M2 MacBook Air: Maximum one external display\u2014read our workarounds below. M3 MacBook Air: Maximum two external displays if MacBook lid is closed. M2 MacBook Pro: Maximum one external display\u2014read our workarounds below. M2 Pro MacBook Pro: Maximum two external displays M2 Max MacBook Pro: Maximum four external displays M3 MacBook Pro: Maximum one external display\u2014read our workarounds below. M3 Pro MacBook Pro: Maximum two external displays M3 Max MacBook Pro: Maximum four external displays However, there are ways around this plain M1/M2/M3 limitation, allowing you to run two or more external displays off your MacBook, which we will outline here. In each case, there\u2019s a software download and a docking station, hub, or adapter required. The simplest solution is to get a USB graphics-enabled docking station or hub, sometimes called a DisplayLink Dock\u2014and we\u2019ve reviewed the best ones later in this article. USB graphics is a software-based technology (DisplayLink or InstantView) that compresses the video signals from the computer to the monitor, enabling you to connect multiple external displays to your M1, M2 or M3 MacBook. Installing third-party software drivers leads to a slight risk that these might later be unsupported by future updates of the macOS, but the two drivers we recommend are recognized industry standards that we think will continue to be supported. External displays: Big problem for M1, M2 and some M3 Macs Apple\u2019s Mac mini, MacBook Air, and 13-inch MacBook Pro were the first Macs to feature the Apple-designed M1 processor (CPU). They received rave reviews for their speed improvements over Intel-based laptops, including here on Macworld. But if your MacBook setup includes running more than one external display, you have a major problem. Apple\u2019s basic M1 and M2 chips simply won\u2019t allow it\u2014at least natively. Apple states in the M1 or M2 MacBook Air and M3 MacBook Pro tech specs that they support only \u201cone external display with up to 6K resolution at 60Hz\u201d. Apple Apple Apple While the M1 and M2 MacBooks natively support just one monitor, the M1 and M2 Mac Mini does natively support up to two external monitors\u2014one via the HDMI port and a second via USB-C. But the M1 and M2 models of the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro (plus the M3 MacBook Pro) support only a single external display over Thunderbolt. The latest M3 MacBook Air models (13- and 15-inch) are the first to support more than one external display\u2014as long as you close the laptop\u2019s lid to allow for the second external display. The first display (allowing an open MacBook lid) has a maximum 6K resolution at 60Hz. The second display (requiring the closed lid) can be up to 5K at 60Hz. This leaves the 14-inch M3 MacBook Pro behind the lower-priced 13- and 15-inch MacBook Air models when it comes to external display support. Like the M2 MacBook Air, the M3 MacBook Pro retains the single-display limitation. Apple doesn\u2019t look like it will solve this problem for you\u2014it would prefer you buy one of its more expensive laptops! We have this guide to monitors for M1 Macs and what you need to know before buying. We also cover the basics of how to connect your Mac to an external monitor. Workaround #1: Install DisplayLink software drivers You can use a combination of display technologies to get around the M1/M2/M3 MacBooks\u2019 single-monitor limitation. This should work with most third-party docks, although some manufacturers, such as Caldigit, don\u2019t recommend it. A whole new category of docks\u2014many reviewed below\u2014has appeared to solve the M1/M2/M3 Mac one-screen problem. DisplayLink USB-C docks or just USB-C docks require software drivers to enable data compression that make them almost as powerful as a Thunderbolt dock. You\u2019ll need to download the appropriate DisplayLink software from the dock manufacturer\u2014full instructions later on. Many multi-display docks use a combination of native USB-C Alternate Mode (native \u201cAlt Mode\u201d video output) and DisplayLink technology. This combination serves as a workaround to the M1/M2/M3 platform supporting only a single external display via USB-C. Note that DisplayLink requires a third-party driver to be installed on the Mac. There are different versions of the DisplayLink driver, and some bring their own compromises to the party. But, in general, setup is straightforward. Some of the docks we review below offer the DisplayLink software when you first connect the dock to your Mac. The DisplayLink macOS app or DisplayLink Manager app are ways of enabling DisplayLink technology on macOS. The app is available as a standalone installer rather than through the mac App Store. Plugable docking station and three external displays via DisplayLink. Plugable docking station and three external displays via DisplayLink. Plugable docking station and three external displays via DisplayLink. 1. First, download the latest Mac DisplayLink driver. As stated above, some docks, do this for you but it\u2019s always best to use the latest version. DisplayLink Manager Graphics Connectivity App v. 1.8.1 is compatible with macOS Big Sur 11, Monterey 12, Ventura 13 and Sonoma 14. It can be managed via the DisplayLink icon in the Apple Menu bar. The macOS requires the user to permit \u201cScreen Recording\u201d in order for DisplayLink devices to work properly. This can be found in System Preferences under Privacy in Security & Privacy; navigate to Screen Recording in the list on the left, then tick the Screen Recording permission for DisplayLink Manager after unlocking the padlock using your admin password. You may need to quit and restart DisplayLink Manager afterward. Installation is straightforward. Older versions did not support laptops\u2019 closed-display/Clamshell mode, but 1.8.1 does support Clamshell mode if the MacBook is Intel-based running macOS 12 or if the MacBook is M1-based running macOS 11 or later. The most scary bit is when you need to enable \u201cScreen Recording\u201d to allow the DisplayLink Manager app to capture pixels and send them to your USB peripheral. This entails making some adjustments in the Mac\u2019s \u201cPrivacy\u201d tab, but you are walked through it step by step. Take a look at the instructions here. There\u2019s an option in DisplayLink manager to \u201claunch at startup\u201d, or you can drag the DisplayLink Manager to your Login Items in Users & Groups. 2. Then connect the MacBook to a docking station. 3. For the first screen you can connect via the dock\u2019s DisplayPort or HDMI Port, and this will be handled natively by the M1/M2 MacBook. You could also connect the first external display via the dock\u2019s other display ports or via a Thunderbolt or USB-C to HDMI or DisplayPort adapter. The HDMI or DisplayPort output uses Alternate Mode (Alt Mode), and as it is basically a pipeline directly to the system\u2019s native GPU, it will behave just like if you hooked up a USB-C to HDMI dongle to your laptop. This requires no user driver installation. The second and third displays will rely on the DisplayLink software. DisplayLink uses an installed driver and the system CPU and GPU to convert graphics data on the system into data packets. That data is then sent over the cable as data packets and converted back to video information and output to the monitors via the DisplayLink chip in the docking station. Workaround #2: Install InstantView software Another third-party software solution is SiliconMotion\u2019s InstantView, which operates in a similar way to DisplayLink and works with three of the hardware hubs and adapters we review below. The initial setup is easier than DisplayLink with the hubs from Hyper but similar to the Satechi hub\u2014but it suffers the same challenge that Apple\u2019s software updates can disable it, which will entail installing a newer version and allowing the necessary security & privacy settings for screen recording, just as with DisplayLink. You can download the latest version of InstantView software here. Neither software solution is complicated and both worked well in our tests as you can read below. Which docks support DisplayLink and InstantView? Originally, dock manufacturers did not officially support such a DisplayLink setup for Macs. The solution works, but they rightly warned that this could become unstuck in future versions of the macOS. Whenever there is a new OS update the drivers may need to be updated each time. However, after some recent testing and improvements Plugable, for example, has updated its compatibility to officially support that configuration. For Mac compatibility, it has validated both Apple and Intel platforms running at least macOS 11. Which dock is best? A docking station connects to your MacBook via Thunderbolt or USB-C. It then offers multiple ports that your laptop now has access to. These can include new display ports, such as HDMI, as well as Gigabit Ethernet for wired Internet access, USB-C/Thunderbolt/USB-A ports at varying speeds, audio plugs, and card readers. Learn more about the best Thunderbolt docking stations for more details, or you can connect via a simpler USB-C hub. Look for a dock with two or more display ports, preferably ones that can connect to your preferred displays without the need for an adapter. Thunderbolt 4 docks or hubs often have no dedicated display port but three available TB4 ports that can be used to connect directly to a USB-C display or via adapters to HDMI or DisplayPort monitors. While you may have to buy an adapter cable, 40Gbps Thunderbolt 4\u2019s port flexibility and backward compatibility are recommended for users of modern Macs such as the M1 and M2 MacBooks. USB-C docks and hubs are usually cheaper, though. Docking station and hub manufacturers are now actively marketing their products as solutions to the M1/M2/M3 external display limitation. Each requires either the DisplayLink download or another similar software solution, such as InstantView, but no further hardware adapter except for the dock or hub itself. And of course, these hubs offer the usual multi-port benefits as well as the external monitor solution. The best multiscreen hubs and adapters for M1, M2 and M3 MacBooks Below we have gathered the best dedicated hubs and docks for multiscreen M1/M2/M3. Note that these listed (and tested) below use USB-C rather than Thunderbolt, so don\u2019t benefit from the MacBook\u2019s potential 40Gbps data bandwidth. If you require all 40Gbps, go for a Thunderbolt dock and install DisplayLink as instructed above. Alogic DX3 Triple 4K Display Universal Docking Station \u2013 three 4K displays at 60Hz Pros Supports three external displays at 4K 60Hz 12 ports, inc. 10Gbps USB-C 3x DisplayPort 1.4 video ports Speedy SD and MicroSD card readers 100W charging and 135W power supply Price When Reviewed: $299.99 Best Prices Today: $279.97 at Amazon$299.99 at Alogic This Alogic DisplayLink docking station is similar to the Satechi Triple 4K Display Dock (reviewed below) in that it supports up to three external 4K displays at an impressive 60Hz refresh rate and has an array of useful non-display ports. It can power the connected laptop at 100W and has a decent 135W external power supply so doesn\u2019t require an extra USB-C charger. The DisplayLink download link is clearly shown in the user manual, and instructions make sense\u2014although you need a magnifying glass to read them! The DX3 has fewer video ports than the Satechi dock but all are top-notch DisplayPort 1.4. If any of your monitors lacks DisplayPort but has HDMI, you\u2019ll need to add an adapter between dock and display. As you\u2019ll need to buy video cables anyway, this doesn\u2019t matter as prices for straight cable and adapter cable are close enough. Unlike the Satechi, this dock does have a card reader\u2014indeed it has two: SD and MicroSD, both at top 312MBps UHS-II\u2014allowing you to add inexpensive portable storage to your laptop setup. It also has Gigabit Ethernet, four USB-A (one with 7.5W charging) and two 10Gbps USB-C (one 100W PD upstream to the laptop, and one 7.5W smaller device charging). Choosing between the Alogic DX3 and Satechi Triple 4K docks could be decided on whether your monitors have HDMI rather than DisplayPort, although adapters mean there is an easy solution. We also applaud the DX3 for its dual SD card readers. Reviewed further down this list is Alogic\u2019s DX2, which supports two 4K displays at 60Hz and lacks some of the other ports found on the DX3. if you just need two external monitors for your M1/M2/M3 MacBook this may be a cheaper option.

The user manual includes a QR code that takes you to the software download page. Competitively priced at $299, it features three HDMI ports and two DisplayPorts and can support three 4K displays at 60Hz on a Mac. The mix of HDMI and DisplayPort offers a more flexible monitor choice than some docks tested here, although adapters will provide easy solutions if your dock\u2019s port is DisplayPort but the monitor has just HDMI. There are 12 ports in total, including Gigabit Ethernet and 10Gbps USB-A and USB-C ports\u2014two of which can power devices at a decent 7.5W. The dock connects to the MacBook via 10Gbps USB-C. Unlike most of the docks reviewed here it comes with its own 130W power supply, so doesn\u2019t require a high-powered USB-C charger. It doesn\u2019t boast a card reader to add inexpensive portable storage to your laptop, but you can buy one cheaply enough to attach to one of the USB ports. At the time of writing, it\u2019s available in North America only but UK and EU versions are planned.

Hyper says that it works \u201cwithout having to download cumbersome drivers\u201d but there is some software installation involved, and you need to allow InstantView access to your Privacy settings in System Preferences. You connect the hub or adapter to your M1 MacBook and find the HyperDisplay app that appears in a Finder folder sidebar. Double-click the macOS InstantView icon and follow the System Preferences instructions. Once this has been completed your MacBook will automatically recognize the adapter from then on. It\u2019s an easier solution than DisplayLink but with the same ability to allow M1, M2 and M3 Macs to connect to multiple external displays. This compact hub still includes 10 ports, including the all-important 2x HDMI. The first display at 60Hz is added via HDMI and DP Alt-mode and the second at 4K 30Hz through HDMI and InstantView. Also included are Gigabit Ethernet, MicroSD card reader (UHS-I), 3.5mm audio jack, 2x 5Gbps USB-A, and one 5Gbps USB-C. A further USB-C PD port allows you to charge the connected laptop at up to 100W\u2014handy as the hub itself uses up one of your M1, M2 or M3 laptop\u2019s two Thunderbolt ports.

Like the Ugreen dock, it requires a USB-C charger for power and can pass through up to 85W to the connected MacBook, but connects via slower 5Gbps USB-C. Baseus 17-in-1 Docking Station \u2013 three 4K displays at 30Hz Pros Supports three external displays at 4K 30Hz 15 (actual) ports 85W PD Cons Requires USB-C charger for laptop 30Hz 4K not 60Hz Only mirrors laptop display Best Prices Today: $119.99 at Amazon$137.49 at Aliexpress The Baseus 17-in-1 Docking Station has three HDMI ports, each of which can connect to an external 4K display at 30Hz. If you require three 4K external displays at 60Hz, the Ugreen Triple Display Dock will fulfill your needs better. If 30Hz is fine, the Baseus will save you money. 60Hz is better for gamers as it offers smoother video. One big limitation for Macs, though, is that the external displays can only mirror and not extend the Mac\u2019s screen. Its claim to have 17 ports is exaggerated slightly as one is for the external power supply that powers just the dock at 12W. and another to add power the dock via a USB-C charger and then onto the laptop. But it has 15 other ports including the upstream 5Gbps USB-C connection to the MacBook, plus Gigabit Ethernet, card readers and 5Gbps USB-A and USB-C ports. StarTech.com USB-C Hybrid Triple Monitor Docking Station \u2013 DisplayLink dock with video options Pros Supports three external displays at 4K 60Hz 15 ports, inc. 10Gbps USB-C and USB-A 85W passthrough charging Cons No card reader DisplayPort didn't work on our test Mac Price When Reviewed: $293.99 Best Prices Today: $224.21 at Amazon This triple-monitor DisplayLink-based docking station is positively bristling with ports: 15 in total. Most interesting to us here are the six video ports: 3x DisplayPort 1.4 and 3x HDMI 2.0. This doesn\u2019t mean you can connect six displays but it does should give you flexible options for the type of connection that fit your displays. However, in testing we had no success linking via DisplayPort, which makes the extra options rather worthless. As such, we prefer the other docks and hubs reviewed above. You need to download the DisplayLink drivers for your M1/M2/M3 Mac. StarTech.com has a link and a video, or just follow our guide above. As well as the half-dozen video ports are six USB ports: 2x USB-C (one at 10Gbps and one 5Gbps), plus 4x USB-A (one 10Gbps and three 5Gbps). The 5Gbps USB-C port can charge a connected device at 18W, enough to fast-charge an iPhone. One of the 5Gbps USB-A ports can charge at 7.5W. Rounding off the many ports are Gigabit Ethernet and a 3.5mm Audio In-Out. There\u2019s no card reader to add portable storage but you could connect an adapter to one of the USB ports. If your hub or dock has just one display port, you could also attach a second or third display via one or more of the spare USB ports, using an adapter such as StarTech.com USB 3.0 to Dual HDMI Adapter. This costs around $60 or \u00a350, so needs to be factored in when pricing an M1/M2 MacBook purchase if you require multiple monitors and want to use the USB-A port rather than a video port such as HDMI or DisplayPort. Another option is Plugable\u2019s USB Dual 4K Display Adapter, which can work via USB-A or USB-C. If you need to connect to an old-school DVI or even VGA monitor, the StarTech.com USB 3.0 to HDMI / DVI Adapter will fulfil your needs. This adapter turns an available USB-A 3.0 or USB-C port\u2014via an included USB-B adapter cable\u2014into one DVI-I or VGA port (DVI to VGA adapter included) and one HDMI output. Each display can simultaneously support the maximum resolution of 2048\u00d71152 at 60Hz. Make sure to use an active HDMI DisplayLink adapter that can support 4K at 60Hz, as some are limited to 4K at 30Hz. Remember that these will only work when you have installed the DisplayLink software; see above. We prefer to stick with USB-C where possible, and so recommend the more functional docks tested below. Workaround caveats Whenever there is a new OS update DisplayLink and InstantView drivers may need to be updated each time. Plugable doesn\u2019t recommend the workaround for gaming, video editing, digital audio workstations (DAWs), and protected content (HDCP) playback. For these workloads, users will want the full throughput of a \u201cbare-metal\u201d native GPU connection\u2014such as provided by the DisplayPort or HDMI port on the dock using Alt Mode. Caldigit actively recommends against using DisplayLink, as it finds it unreliable and there would be no synergy between the driver and the dock. Because it requires a third-party driver, users are at the mercy of Apple and the third-party developer to support later versions, the company told Macworld. However, this combination of display technologies does allow M1 and M2 MacBooks to run more than one external monitor, and the M1 and M2 Mac mini to run more than two. And more manufacturers are coming out with docks and hubs that support it. The only risk is that it could stop working at any time, although it wouldn\u2019t harm your system if it did, and you could simply uninstall DisplayLink. DisplayLink and InstantView are workarounds with a potentially limited timespan but the likelihood is that compatibility would be restored at some stage if the worst happened and you would get back your multi-monitor setup. Read our M1 MacBook Air review and everything you need to know about the M2 MacBook Pro and M2 MacBook Air. If you are wanting to use a second display with your Mac and not have your Mac\u2019s screen on, read our feature How to turn a Mac\u2019s screen off. Want to use an 8K monitor? Read How to connect an 8K display to your Mac. What you need to know about DisplayLink and InstantView FAQ 1. Does DisplayLink and InstantView block Netflix or other streaming content? DisplayLink and InstantView are great at adding multiple monitors to M1, M2 and M3 Macs, but there is a catch. Some protected content in Netflix, AppleTV, Amazon Prime, Disney+ or YouTube TV and other streaming applications may not play. The video remains black while audio keeps playing. This is all down to how the macOS interfaces the DisplayLink driver used to access graphics content. As soon as one DisplayLink-enabled screen is connected, protected content becomes unavailable on all screens. This is down to the streaming platforms using High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection (HDCP), which is Intel-developed digital copy protection that prevents copying of digital audio and video content as it travels across connections. Because macOS requires DisplayLink and InstantView to enable Screen Recording, HDCP moves in because it thinks you are actually trying to record the content rather than just display it on screen. 2. How to enable streaming content when using DisplayLink or InstantView To get round HDCP stopping your DisplayLink or InstantView setup showing Netflix, Amazon Prime and other streaming services, you may need to disconnect all the DisplayLink or InstantView screens, or switch to a browser other than Safari or Chrome (for example Opera or Firefox). You can disable hardware acceleration in your browser to access the protected content. On Google Chrome, go to Google Chrome settings, and click on \u201cAdvanced\u201d and then select \u201cSystem\u201d. Here you can disable \u201cUse hardware acceleration when available\u201d. Select \u201cRelaunch\u201d to activate the new setting. If that doesn\u2019t solve the black issue, disconnect the docking station, and try using the laptop\u2019s build-in display or the direct video ports of the laptop. Uninstalling the software is the ultimate solution. Docks and Hubs, Laptop Accessories, MacBook, Monitors",

    "description": "Taipei\u2019s defense ministry announced Friday the highest single-day number of Chinese military aircraft around the self-ruled island this year, which analysts attributed as a reaction to Taiwan\u2019s political outreach to Europe in recent days.Beijing claims democratic Taiwan as part of its territory and has never renounced the use of force to bring it under China\u2019s control.Friday\u2019s incursion, an uptick from the previous day\u2019s tally, follows a pattern of what experts dub \u201cgrey zone\u201d actions\u2014tactics that fall short of outright acts of war\u2014which have ramped up since the 2016 election of President Tsai Ing-wen.Political tensions have also risen since January after Tsai\u2019s deputy Lai Ching-te\u2014who Beijing regards as a \u201cdangerous separatist\u201d\u2014was elected as president, and amid an ongoing row between China and Taiwan over a fatal boat incident.In the 24 hours leading up to 6:00 am Friday (2200 GMT Thursday), the Ministry of National Defence said it had detected 36 Chinese military aircraft and six naval ships operating around Taiwan.The ministry added that among the aircraft detected, 13 had \u201ccrossed the median line of the Taiwan Strait\u201d, the sensitive waterway separating China from Taiwan.Friday\u2019s announcement comes on the heels of nighttime activity by the Chinese military, with Taiwan\u2019s defense ministry announcing around 10:30 pm Thursday that 20 fighter jets, aerial unmanned vehicles and transport planes had been detected from 7:30 pm.It is also the day after an uptick in activity during the 24-hour period ending at 6:00 am Thursday, when the ministry said Beijing had sent in 32 aircraft.Bearing the pressureAhead of January\u2019s election of Lai, Beijing warned he would bring \u201cwar and decline\u201d to the island.Lai will take office on May 20 alongside vice president-elect Hsiao Bi-khim of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).Hsiao\u2014formerly Taiwan\u2019s de facto ambassador to the United States\u2014has been traveling in recent days, including to the Czech Republic and the European Parliament.\u201cOur fight for freedom and democracy is more shared than ever, and the Taiwanese people can rest assured it will always find dear friends in Europeans,\u201d wrote French politician Dominique Riquet, who is also a member of the European Parliament, on social media platform X on Thursday.China had slammed Hsiao\u2019s visit to the Czech Republic on Tuesday, accusing her of trying to serve \u201cthe purpose of Taiwan independence\u201d\u2014a redline for Beijing.Analyst Wen-ti Sung said Beijing\u2019s jump in military activity may be a \u201cshow of force to drive home its displeasure against Taiwan\u2019s growing international engagement\u201d.\u201cIf this can discourage other international leaders from meeting Hsiao in the future, all the better from Beijing\u2019s perspective,\u201d he told AFP.Military expert Su Tzu-yun agreed Hsiao\u2019s European travels could play a motivating factor but pointed to Asia for added reasons, including a recent Manila meeting between US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos.China and the Philippines are both claimants in maritime hotspot the South China Sea, where Beijing\u2019s ships have been accused of causing collisions with Philippine boats and firing water cannon at them during a resupply mission.Blinken earlier this week said the United States stands by its \u201cironclad\u201d commitments to defend longtime ally the Philippines, drawing a rebuke from Beijing that Washington had \u201cno right\u201d to interfere in the issue.\u201cChina\u2019s behaviors are not only directed at Taiwan, but Taiwan will be the one that bears the most pressure,\u201d Su, a military expert at Taiwan\u2019s Institute for National Defense and Security Research, told AFP.Chinese boat rowAdding to tensions, a row between Taipei and Beijing over a fatal fishing boat incident has dragged on since last month.A Chinese speedboat carrying four people capsized on February 14 near Taiwan\u2019s Kinmen islands while being pursued by the Taiwanese coast guard, killing two people while the other two survived.Beijing has accused Taiwanese authorities of \u201cseeking to evade their responsibilities and hide the truth\u201d about the incident, while the Taiwanese coast guard said the boat involved was zigzagging and \u201clost its balance\u201d before capsizing.China has said it will step up patrols around Kinmen following a series of deadly incidents, including the sinking of another boat in the area this month that resulted in the deaths of two crew members.(AFP)",

    "description": "A Republican congressman fighting to keep his vulnerable seat in Nebraska quietly deleted a portion of his website that bragged about his anti-abortion bonafides \u2014 signaling just how potentially harmful the GOP's current stance on abortion can be to its own party, a report stated Friday.The section on Don Bacon's website declared that he \u201cwill always fight to defend the right to life.\u201d Also deleted from the website were the perfect ratings he received from anti-abortion organizations like the Susan B. Anthony List, National Right to Life, and the Faith and Freedom Coalition. As Rolling Stone points out, Bacon is running for reelection in Nebraska\u2019s competitive second district \u2014 which Joe Biden won in the 2020 election. Bacon's opponent, Democratic state Sen. Tony Vargas, is drawing attention to Bacon's stance on abortion, previously saying that he \u201csupports a nationwide abortion ban with no exceptions, not even for the life of the mother\" \u2014 prompting Bacon to reply that Vargas' accusation was a \"lie.\" Also read: 'The clock has started': Marjorie Taylor Greene tells Johnson his days are numbered\u201cI\u2019ve always defended the life of the mother,\" Bacon claimed. But according to Rolling Stone, Bacon is the one who's lying. \"The congressman has previously signed on as co-sponsor of the Life at Conception Act, not once but twice \u2014 in 2019 and 2021,\" the magazine reported.\"The 2021 version declared that the right to life guaranteed by the Constitution 'is vested in each human being \u2026 including the moment of fertilization, cloning, or other moment at which an individual member of the human species comes into being.'\" The report also points out that Bacon was the \"only vulnerable\" Republican House member to urge the Supreme Court to allow states to ban hospitals from providing emergency abortions. Bacon also reportedly deleted language from his website suggesting that he was willing to find \"a bipartisan solution for those currently in our country under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Program (DACA).\u201d In its place are now bullet points highlighting his desire \u201cto resume construction of the border wall, reinstate the Remain in Mexico Policy, hire more border patrol agents, and stop the flow of fentanyl that is poisoning our kids.\u201d",

    "description": "Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire is a busy movie. It's got the new group of Ghostbusters, the old group of Ghostbusters, a guy who's the heir to an entirely separate Ghostbusting tradition, and tons of accompanying new lore about that and the terrifying new spirit threat. It's a lot of stuff to balance, but new director Gil Kenan has some experience with that--he co-wrote Ghostbusters: Afterlife with that film's director, Jason Reitman, and Afterlife was a similarly full flick.Reitman, whose father Ivan directed the original two Ghostbusters movies, stuck around to help Kenan write Frozen Empire--Kenan described the younger Reitman to me as \"my writing partner, and creative collaborator and best friend for a long time\"--and the task of both balancing so many disparate elements and even unifying them required all their effort.\"It sort of happens in a couple of ways. One is, we're fans, right? Even though for Jason, this is deeply personal, and was his family business growing up. I saw the first movie with my dad in a movie theater when I was seven,\" Kenan told me. \"I'd never met any single person in my life until I was like 16, or 17, who had ever worked on a movie. For me, it was purely from the outside looking in. But that doesn't mean that my relationship to these characters was any different than for Jason, even though he knew the actors playing them. He, just like me, has a deep love for these characters. And that love comes from us wanting the best for them as fans.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast / Getty Sarko Gergerian, a Massachusetts police lieutenant, is not your average cop. He\u2019s also a trained MDMA-assisted therapist. His police chief even gave him permission to take a trip with the medicine, also known as ecstasy or molly, during a clinical trial. \u201cIt opened my heart and mind,\u201d he told The Daily Beast.For decades in the U.S., police officers have served as the frontline troops in a militarized war on drugs in which millions were jailed for non-violent offenses. But a small cadre of serving and former police officers, in the U.S. and across the world, are\u2014like Gergerian\u2014 finding that when used responsibly and therapeutically, some of the drugs can ease distress and make them happier.On the sidelines of the United Nations\u2019 annual Commission on Narcotic Drugs in Vienna on Wednesday, Gergerian sat beside three former senior policemen as part of a panel organized by Law Enforcement Action Partnership (LEAP) titled \u201cWhy Police Need Access to Psychedelics Urgently\u201d. They pressed authorities around the world to swiftly make available MDMA-assisted therapy (MDMA-AT) to their comrades both as a preventive medicine and treatment for PTSD, which is rampant and may affect as many as one-in-two officers. The scale of the mental health crisis in policing means that, in the U.S. and the U.K., officers are more likely to commit suicide than die on duty.Read more at The Daily Beast.",

The building was originally used as the head office of the now-defunct Chohung Bank, which was acquired and merged by Shinhan Bank in 2006. It is currently occupied by Shinhan Financial\u2019s non-banking units \u2013 Shinhan Securities Co., Shinhan Capital Co., Shinhan Savings Bank Co., Shinhan DS Co. and Shinhan Credit Information Inc. The redevelopment plan is to demolish the old building to build a 172-meter, 40-story skyscraper, which will be taller than the 117-meter headquarters building of Shinhan\u2019s bigger crosstown rival KB Financial Group Inc. in Yeouido. In 2023, Shinhan Financial earned 4.36 trillion won ($3.2 billion) in net profit, falling short of KB Financial\u2019s 4.63 trillion won, according to their regulatory filings. They are Korea\u2019s top two leading banking groups. Once it is built, Shinhan\u2019s new building will be also taller than neighboring Mirae Asset Center 1, the area\u2019s landmark office complex rented to Korea\u2019s No. 1 securities company Mirae Asset Securities Co. and various foreign firms\u2019 Seoul operations such as McKinsey & Company, Boston Consulting Group, Bloomberg and KKR.FOR BETTER SYNERGY AMONG NON-BANKING UNITSShinhan\u2019s new tower is expected to house Shinhan\u2019s non-banking units to create greater synergy, especially in wealth management, retail banking and corporate banking sectors. Jin Ok-dong, Shinhan Financial Group chairman, has been calling for close collaborations among affiliates since he took the helm in March 2023. In December, the leading financial group launched a super app called Shinhan Super SOL, where its users can access all of Shinhan\u2019s banking, credit card, stock and insurance services in a single app. This was the outcome of Shinhan\u2019s accelerated digital collaborations among affiliates. With all non-banking units under one roof, Korea\u2019s No. 2 financial group is expected to enhance the competitiveness of those units. Shinhan Financial raked in 1.65 trillion won in net profit from non-banking businesses in 2023, down 15.7% from the prior year. Its net profit from non-banking operations accounted for 35% of its total profit, the largest among the country\u2019s top four financial groups \u2013 Shinhan, KB, Hana Financial Group Inc. and Woori Financial Group Inc. Its presence in the non-life insurance sector, however, is still weak and needs improvement. Shinhan offers various financial services ranging from banking to life insurance, securities, credit card service and asset management. Before it in 2021 acquired BNP Paribas Cardif General Insurance, which later became Shinhan EZ Insurance, for 40 billion won, it was absent from Korea\u2019s non-life insurance market. Shinhan Financial Group has no plan to move the group\u2019s headquarters building on Taepyeongro or its flagship banking unit Shinhan Bank\u2019s head office. Shinhan Securities\u2019 main office will also stay in Yeouido for now. It is projected to complete the construction of the new landmark office building in Jung-gu by 2031.

    "description": "Global proxy advisors International Shareholder Services Inc. (ISS) and Glass Lewis & Co. have expressed their opinions that there is no need for South Korea\u2019s JB Financial Group to accept Align Partners Capital Management Inc.\u2019s demand on the group\u2019s substantial board overhaul, banking sources said on Sunday.The advisors\u2019 recommendations are expected to influence stakeholders who will vote on JB Financial\u2019s board directors at the general shareholders meeting on March 28. Foreign investors hold a 35.68% stake in the local financial services provider.Align Partners, a Seoul-based fund with a 14.04% stake in JB Financial, is demanding the company appoint five new outside directors it has recommended and increase the number of non-executive directors from the current one to two to enhance JB Financial\u2019s governance. In a report on March 17, ISS said the dissident (Align Partners) called out JB Financial\u2019s governance issues but came short of providing concrete evidence to substantiate a malignant intention. A change is not warranted at this time, ISS noted.While the group\u2019s growth has moderated in the past two years, it has a clear strategy and the incumbent directors have a proven track record, ISS added.Glass Lewis said on March 17 that it believes Align Partners may be taking somewhat of a misguided approach in focusing its efforts on targeting a bank in JB Financial that undoubtedly has been the best-performing bank among the publicly traded Korean banks by various relevant metrics. JB Financial has insisted it appoints only one of the five outside director candidates that Align Partners has recommended and fills the remaining seats with ones that JB Financial\u2019s board recommends.By Euijin Jeongjustjin@hankyung.comJihyun Kim edited this article.",

    "description": "Macworld Welcome to our weekly Apple Breakfast column, which includes all the Apple news you missed last week in a handy bite-sized roundup. We call it Apple Breakfast because we think it goes great with a Monday morning cup of coffee or tea, but it\u2019s cool if you want to give it a read during lunch or dinner hours too. Shrink different The iPad is in a difficult place. As I\u2019ve discussed before, it doesn\u2019t really have anywhere to go: the post-PC world never came to pass, leaving a dwindling market of sofa-based tablet users for whom a very basic spec and feature set is more than good enough, and who will take a lot of convincing to replace their existing model with something new. At some point soon, Apple is expected to reveal to the world its master plan for the iPad. But it remains to be seen whether the world will be convinced. One theory is that we\u2019ll get a bigger-screen iPad Air, which is a sensible if unthrilling idea. While another more recent prediction suggests that Apple is going to shrink the bezels. Shrinking the bezels is one of those ideas that always sound good to consumers and journalists, but I suspect rings less pleasingly in the ears of engineers. From the outside that annoying screenless bit around the edge of your iPad seems like dead wood, crying out to be replaced by either more screen (who wouldn\u2019t want more screen space in a device of the same size?) or nothing at all (who wouldn\u2019t want a smaller device offering the same screen space?). But of course, in practice there is nothing remotely like dead wood in the design of a current-gen iPad, which is crammed so full of vital high-powered components that a 1960s rocket scientist would think it was magic. So while debezelling might sound like a simple and obvious change, there are complications that may not be apparent to the layperson. Adding the componentry for extra screen space brings costs in terms of weight and battery capacity and literal cost; as would removing the componentry that lay under the bezel you\u2019ve now removed. An iPad is a finely honed ecosystem of interlocking parts, and an alteration in one area will result in consequences somewhere else that you probably won\u2019t like. In any case, we\u2019ve been here before. The iPhone 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max had their bezels shrunk fractionally compared to the previous generation, barely registering on our reviewer\u2019s radar. The M2 MacBook Air has slimmer bezels than its predecessor, but this meant the front-facing camera had to be put in an annoying notch. More screen space overall, then, but also a more distracting visual profile. The iPhone 16 generation is likely to see a similar shrinkage, as could an upcoming big-screen iMac, because it\u2019s the sort of change Apple\u2019s marketing machine can point to as wholly positive. But I would dispute that. At best it makes very little difference to the user experience. Bezel fever is a dubious quest, as far as I\u2019m concerned, but particularly so in the case of the iPad. An iPhone with near-invisible bezels can still be held in relative comfort, while a bezel-free MacBook can sit on a lap or be held from beneath. But the zero-bezel iPad would fall between the two stools. Its weight and physical design mean there\u2019s nearly always a steadying thumb creeping around on to the front surface, which is fine when it\u2019s on the bezel, but frustrating when it\u2019s obscuring and leaving thumb prints on active screen. There are lots of things Apple can change about the iPad range; they may or may not save it from irrelevancy, but they\u2019re worth a try. While shrinking the bezels strikes me as a waste of time.

Once, it was thought that attractive, sleek, and light touchscreen PCs could fuse laptops and tablets to make both obsolete in the process, but today many shoppers\u2014and laptop manufacturers\u2014have refocused on larger, more powerful machines.But the dream of a single, do-it-all device isn\u2019t entirely abandoned. The HP Spectre x360 14-inch is an attractive and slim 2-in-1 that\u2019s portable enough to use in any situation. It\u2019s a great choice for frequent fliers and business travelers, though Windows\u2019 old touchscreen woes remain an obstacle. Looking for more options? Check out PCWorld\u2019s roundup of the best laptops available right now. HP Spectre x360 14: Specs and features The HP Spectre x360 14\u2019s specifications are impressive for a 14-inch 2-in-1 device. It has Intel\u2019s Core Ultra 155H 16-core processor, 32GB of memory, a 2TB solid state drive, and a 2880\u00d71800 OLED touchscreen. All of these specifications are upgrades from the base model, but HP\u2019s upgrade pricing is reasonable. CPU: Intel Core Ultra 7 155H Memory: 32GB LPDDR5 Graphics/GPU: Intel Arc integrated Display: 2880\u00d71800 OLED touchscreen up to 120Hz Storage: 2TB M.2 NVMe PCIe 4 solid state drive Webcam: 4K webcam Connectivity: 2x USB Type-C, 1x USB Type-A, 1x 3.5mm combo audio jack Networking: Wi-Fi 7 Bluetooth 5.4 Biometrics: Windows Hello facial recognition, fingerprint reader Battery capacity: 68 watt-hour Dimensions: 12.35 x 8.68 x 0.67 inches Weight: 3.19 pounds MSRP: $1,449.99 to start, $1,819.99 as tested That\u2019s not all. The Spectre x360 14 also has a 4K webcam with an IR reader for facial recognition login, a fingerprint reader, optional Wi-Fi 7 support, and an included rechargeable active stylus. These features add up to an expensive yet reasonable $1,819.99 MSRP which, at the time of this review, was discounted to $1,519.99. HP Spectre x360 14: Design and build quality IDG / Matthew Smith IDG / Matthew Smith IDG / Matthew Smith I was immediately smitten by the HP Spectre x360 14. Not because it\u2019s different, or innovative, but because HP bothers to get the boring things right. That begins with the quality of the materials used. The Spectre x360 14 uses metal for the upper and lower body, as well as the hinges. That\u2019s not unusual for a 2-in-1 above $1,000, but the specific texture and luster HP picked stands out. It appears sleek and modern but, when handled, has just enough grip and texture to feel pleasant and inviting. The chassis isn\u2019t unibody, meaning it has a removable bottom panel, but it feels nearly as rigid as 2-in-1s that go that route. The design also benefits from attention to detail. The Spectre x360 has a stern, professional look, but the edges of the device are smoothed to keep them from pressing into your palms and fingers. That\u2019s important for a device meant to be used like a tablet. The 360-hinge design also works flawlessly. It offers enough tension to keep the display at a desired angle, yet remains smooth when folding the device from laptop to tablet mode, or vice-versa.That\u2019s not to say it\u2019s perfect, and the usual compromises are required. As its name implies, the Spectre x360 14 has a 14-inch display, so it\u2019s much larger than even the largest iPad Pro. It also weighs 3.19 pounds, which is a lot of heft to maneuver with your fingertips. The Spectre x360 is usable as a tablet for short periods of time, or when resting in your lap or knees, but it\u2019s not great if you want a tablet for note-taking, to read books or documents, or to use while reclining. HP faces stiff competition from alternatives like the Lenovo Yoga 9i 14, which also delivers thin, light, and attractive design. I think HP remains a step behind Lenovo but, of course, that\u2019s subject to taste. The Lenovo Yoga 9i strikes a more luxurious and elegant profile, while the Spectre x360 14 is more professional and serious. And while the HP doesn\u2019t beat the Lenovo, it\u2019s an obvious upgrade over more affordable 2-in-1s like the Asus Zenbook 14 Flip OLED. HP Spectre x360 14: Keyboard, trackpad IDG / Matthew Smith IDG / Matthew Smith IDG / Matthew Smith I expect, however, that the Spectre x360 14 will be used as a laptop far more often than a tablet. Fortunately, HP\u2019s excellent design extends to the keyboard and touchpad. The keyboard occupies a significant portion of the 2-in-1\u2019s width, though it does sacrifice a few millimeters to upwards-firing speakers on each side. Despite that, the keyboard has a spacious layout and most keys are large. The left-side Shift, Caps, and Tab keys are shaved down a bit, but not so much I found it noticeable. There\u2019s also plenty of space below the keyboard, so my palms weren\u2019t left dangling in mid-air. Key travel is respectable despite the slim profile and each key ends its action with a definitive tactile action. However, I think HP missed the mark on the plastic used for the key caps. It feels thin and takes away from the otherwise luxurious design. That\u2019s a shame, since the keyboard is the part of the device most often touched. The touchpad is another highlight. It\u2019s large for a 14-inch laptop at five and a half inches wide by three and a quarter inches deep. There\u2019s barely any space leftover to extend its depth and making it any wider would\u2019ve left my palms sitting wholly inside the touchpad surface, which can lead to unwanted mouse clicks. The touchpad is responsive and its size provides ample room for activating Windows\u2019 most complex multi-touch gestures. HP Spectre x360 14: Display, audio IDG / Matthew Smith IDG / Matthew Smith IDG / Matthew Smith Every 2024 HP Spectre x360 14-inch has a 2880\u00d71800 OLED touchscreen with a maximum refresh rate of 120Hz. It\u2019s a beautiful display with rich colors, incredible contrast, good motion clarity, and crisp sharpness. The downside is brightness, which isn\u2019t as high as some IPS displays and, in combination with the glossy display finish, can at times make the display hard to use in a bright room (or outdoors). But that\u2019s soon forgiven when watching a show on Netflix, playing a PC game, or editing a photo. Media always looks fantastic.It\u2019s also a touchscreen, and the particulars of HP\u2019s design make it easy to use. The 2-in-1 is small enough that the screen remains within easy reach while typing, and the 360 hinge allows for \u201ctent mode,\u201d which rotates the keyboard behind the display and effectively makes it a kickstand. The included active stylus is a nice bonus, too, and makes for quick, easy note-taking. The stylus is thick\u2014more like a marker than a pen, really. I find this comfortable, but people with smaller hands might disagree. While the OLED touchscreen is fantastic, it\u2019s also shared with many competitors. Many laptops now offer this exact display panel, which is produced by Samsung, with and without a touchscreen. And some competitors, like the Asus Zenbook 14 Flip OLED, are much less expensive.The Spectre x360 14\u2019s impressive visuals are matched with strong audio from the upwards-facing speakers. They\u2019re clear, crisp, and loud at maximum volume, but only become muddy in the most bass-heavy music and action sequences. Lenovo\u2019s Yoga 9i has HP beat here, but that competitor ranks among the best audio available on Windows 2-in-1. The Spectre\u2019s speakers are well above average. HP Spectre x360 14: Webcam, microphone, biometrics The HP Spectre x360 14\u2019s webcam goes above and beyond with full 4K resolution at up to 30 frames per second. That\u2019s a very high resolution for a laptop or 2-in-1 webcam and it predictably results in a sharp, attractive image. Exposure is handled well, too, and colors look saturated. In short, it\u2019s a superb webcam.The dual microphone array is run-of-the-mill but does the job. My voice came through clearly even when I spoke softly and the most obvious, repetitive background noise was rejected. The microphone can sound tinny, hollow, or distant, so I wouldn\u2019t recommend it for podcasting or other more demanding audio recording needs, but it\u2019s great for Zoom. Windows Hello biometric login is supported through a fingerprint reader on the power button, which is located on the keyboard, and facial recognition through the included IR camera. I always prefer facial recognition when it\u2019s available, as it\u2019s quicker and more reliable than any fingerprint reader I\u2019ve encountered. Still, it\u2019s nice to have options. Many competitive laptops have either an IR camera or a fingerprint reader, but few have both. HP Spectre x360 14: Connectivity IDG / Matthew Smith IDG / Matthew Smith IDG / Matthew Smith Thin design often leads to a thin selection of ports, and the HP Spectre x360 14 suffers this fate. It has just two USB-C ports, both with DisplayPort and Power Delivery, and one USB-A port. There\u2019s also a 3.5mm combo audio jack. It is good to see that USB-A is at least available, but the combined lack of Ethernet, HDMI, and an SD card reader really narrows the options. I think most owners will need to invest in a USB-C hub or dock. While the port selection is mediocre, HP does have a trick up its sleeve. The 3.5mm combo audio jack and one USB-C port are placed on the far left and right rear corner of the 2-in-1, respectively, and the corner sits at an angle. That makes the ports easy to access from both the rear and side of the 2-in-1 and makes it less likely that the ports will get in the way of your hands when using the Spectre x360 14 as a tablet. It\u2019s an uncommon choice, but a smart one. The 2-in-1\u2019s wired connectivity is joined by standard Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3. An optional Wi-Fi 7 upgrade, which also includes Bluetooth 5.4, is available (though the model I tested didn\u2019t include it). I think Wi-Fi 7 should be standard, but its absence is a minor point, as few people yet own a Wi-Fi 7 router. HP Spectre x360 14: Performance The entry-level HP Spectre x360 14 ships with an Intel Core Ultra 5 125H processor, but the model I tested had the upgrade to Intel\u2019s Core Ultra 7 155H. It also had 32GB of soldered LPDDR5 memory and a 2TB PCIe NVMe M.2 solid state drive. It delivered solid performance, though the 2-in-1\u2019s thermal and power limits can limit its potential. IDG / Matthew Smith IDG / Matthew Smith IDG / Matthew Smith We start off with PCMark 10, where the HP Spectre x360 delivers a strong score of 5,721. That\u2019s better than many older, similar devices, and it defeats last year\u2019s Intel Core i7-1360P, which found its way into many Windows 2-in-1s. However, the Spectre x360 14 lands just a smidge behind the Asus Zenbook UM3402 with AMD Ryzen 7 7730U, and significantly behind the Acer Swift Go 14 with Intel Core Ultra 7 155H. The Swift Go 14 is a thicker, less expensive laptop. IDG / Matthew Smith IDG / Matthew Smith IDG / Matthew Smith Next up is Cinebench R20, a heavily multi-threaded, short-duration processor benchmark. Here the HP Spectre x360 14 again performs much better than older 2-in-1 devices, but it can\u2019t keep up with thicker mid-range laptops like the Asus Zenbook UM3402 and Acer Swift Go 14. IDG / Matthew Smith IDG / Matthew Smith IDG / Matthew Smith Handbrake, a long-duration processor benchmark, (mostly) tells a similar story. Here the HP Spectre x360 14 does beat the AMD-powered Asus Zenbook UM3402, but it\u2019s way behind the Acer Swift Go 14, despite the fact they both have an Intel Core Ultra 7 155H processor. IDG / Matthew Smith IDG / Matthew Smith IDG / Matthew Smith The Intel Core Ultra 7155H includes Intel Arc graphics with eight Xe Cores. It delivers a massive upgrade over the Intel Xe integrated graphics found in prior Intel Core processors. The Asus Zenbook 14 Flip OLED only scored 1,617 in this test, while the HP Spectre x360 14 scores 2,776. Intel Arc integrated graphics still has limits, of course, and will generally lag far behind entry-level consumer graphics, such as Nvidia\u2019s RTX 4050. Still, this is a meaningful boost that should make it possible to play many older 3D games ported to the PC from the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. All the performance results reported above were obtained in the Spectre x360 14\u2019s default \u201cSmart Sense\u201d power profile, which is meant to balance performance and thermals. But HP also provides a \u201cPerformance\u201d profile for enhanced performance, and it delivers the goods. The 2-in-1\u2019s Cinebench R20 score increased from 3,690 to 5,412; 3DMark Time Spy increased from 2,776 to 3,735. That\u2019s a huge gain that more than makes up the gap between the HP Spectre x360 14 and the Acer Swift Go 14. Despite this increase, the Performance mode is not irritating. Fan noise is increased, and the 2-in-1 becomes hot, but I\u2019ve reviewed plenty of laptops that were louder and hotter in their default performance mode. Given this result, I think HP should tweak the \u201cSmart Sense\u201d to more aggressively push performance in apps that require it. I believe many owners will never change this setting, or may change it back and forth only occasionally. Unfortunately, forgetting to use the right performance mode for the job leaves a lot of performance off the table. Still, the performance is there if you know where to look, and it\u2019s impressive for a 2-in-1 of this size. The HP Spectre x360 14 has its limits, but it\u2019s capable of work well beyond web-browsing and document editing. 1080p video editing, digital art, and older 3D games are all well within reach. HP Spectre x360 14: Battery life The HP Spectre x360 14 ships with a 68 watt-hour battery. That\u2019s a healthy capacity for a 14-inch 2-in-1, but modern processors can prove rather power-hungry. These conflicting forces balance each other out. IDG / Matthew Smith IDG / Matthew Smith IDG / Matthew Smith I recorded over 11 hours of battery life in our standard battery test, which loops a 4K trailer of the short film Tears of Steel. That\u2019s an unexceptional but sold result for a modern 2-in-1 and, importantly, it should be enough to provide most users a full workday away from a charger\u2014so long as the most demanding applications are avoided, at least. The Spectre also benefits from USB Power Delivery and relatively low power draw. The included charger is small, and most third-party USB-C chargers intended for laptops will have plenty of juice to charge this 2-in-1. That improves portability, as there\u2019s no need to pack a charger specific to the 2-in-1. HP Spectre x360 14: Conclusion HP\u2019s Spectre x360 14 is a great option if you want a 14-inch Windows 2-in-1 and plan to make full use of its 2-in-1 versatility. It\u2019s thin, light, portable, well-built, and ships with a standard touchscreen and active stylus. The Spectre x360 also benefits from a beautiful OLED display, strong performance, and a large touchpad, and a top-tier webcam. It\u2019s not inexpensive and has a few downsides, like limited connectivity and a merely good keyboard, but it\u2019s on-target for shoppers who still want to live the Windows 2-in-1 dream.

That'a according to to Miriam \u201cMimi\u201d Rocah, a seasoned prosecutor with hours logged in both New York and Westchester counties, who appeared Monday on CNN's \"Out Front\" to laud the New York City jurist overseeing Trump's criminal hush money case. As proof, Rocah pointed to Merchan's handling of Trump's lawyers accusations, levied against prosecutors in the Manhattan District Attorney's office, of misconduct. \"That's so serious, for any lawyer, but especially prosecutors,\" Rocah said. \"That, according to the judge, was not warranted.\"Merchan played the cornerman for the Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg over accusations linked documents handed over by the Manhattan federal prosecutor's office, Rocah argued. While Trump's attorneys demanded delay or even dismissal over the alleged \"widespread misconduct\" of failing to quickly pass the documents, along, Bragg's office said they did their due diligence. ALSO READ: Here's why conservative elites are bailing on Trump nowTrump's attorneys may have pointed fingers at the prosecutors in Trump's hush money case \u2014 in which the former president has pleaded not guilty to falsifying business records to hide alleged payments made to Stormy Daniels \u2014 but Merchan gave them a hat tip, Rocah noted. Specifically, Merchan refused to delay the case and set a court date of April 15. \"This judge, who really calls balls and strikes, said 'In fact, I think the D.A.'s office here seems to have gone above and beyond,'\" Rocah said. \"They've not only fulfilled their obligations under the law, but they went beyond that.\"Rocah took Merchan's admonishment of Trump's attorneys as a sign that he'll push back when the case comes to trial. \"That is part of a judge's job,\" Rocah said \"to police, if you will, the rhetoric and accusations that get thrown around in heated cases.\"Watch the video below or click here.",

    "description": "Macworld It\u2019s hardly breaking news that the next high-end iPhones will have a new processor that\u2019s faster and more capable than the current A17 Pro. But a new rumor claims it will have a new design that\u2019s specifically geared toward AI applications. According to Haitong International Tech Research analyst Jeff Pu (via 9to5Mac), there is \u201cgrowing demand\u201d for Apple\u2019s A18 chip. That\u2019s not a surprise, as Apple is expected to release two versions of its iPhone chip for the first time, with the A18 joining the A18 Pro. That means Apple will be making twice as many chips this year compared to the last two cycles, so it makes sense to start production earlier than usual. More interesting is Pu\u2019s note about Apple\u2019s new process. As he explains, Apple\u2019s A18 Pro will \u201cfeature a larger die area compared to A17 Pro,\u201d which means it will have a lower wafer yield. Rumors claimed that the A17 Pro would feature up to four dies, supporting 10 compute cores each. Pu notes that the chip will have a 6-core GPU like the A17 Pro. The iPhone 16 Pro models are also rumored to start at 256GB of storage to run AI features. Pu says the large die area \u201ccould be a trend for edge AI computing,\u201d which runs algorithms on the device\u2019s neural networks rather than the cloud. According to Nvidia, edge AI is different from cloud AI \u201cbecause the computation is done near the user at the edge of the network, close to where the data is located, rather than centrally in a cloud computing facility or private data center.\u201d As such, some of the AI features expected in iOS 18 could require an iPhone 16 Pro or Pro Max due to the computing power provided by the A18 Pro chip. Google did the same thing with Gemini Nano, its \u201cmost efficient model built for on-device tasks,\u201d which requires the Google Tensor G3 chip that\u2019s exclusive to the Pixel 8 Pro. Apple will likely unveil some AI features in iOS 18 at WWDC. However, any features related to the A18 Pro chip in the iPhone 16 Pro phones won\u2019t be announced until the fall. iOS, iPhone",

    "description": "Since 2005, YouTube has been entertaining us with clips and internet phenomena of all kinds. While viral videos were initially more in demand, music videos have been the most popular since 2010. The song \u201cHello\u201d by Adele is currently at the top of the list of videos that have reached over a billion views the fastest \u2013 with an incredible 87 days. But it\u2019s still not among the top 10 most clicked videos. In the following ranking of the ten most-clicked YouTube videos (as of February 2024), we reveal what they are: 10th place: \u041ciroschka \u0422V \u2013 \u201cLearning Colors \u2013 Colourful Eggs on a Farm\u201d Release date: 26 February 2018 Views: 5 billion In tenth place is an educational video from the Russian channel Miroshka TV to teach children the different colors in Russian. The clip shows several animated eggs on a farm that are colored in stages. The video has been clicked on more than 5 billion times since 2018. 9th place: Mark Ronson ft. Bruno Mars \u2013 \u201cUptown Funk\u201d Release date: 19 November 2014 Views: 5.18 billion In ninth place is the music video \u201cUptown Funk\u201d by music producer Mark Ronson and Bruno Mars. Ronson won the 2015 Brit Awards in the British Single of the Year category with the song. Fun fact: Fleur East performed the song in the semi-final of the 11th season of The X Factor (at the end of 2014), even though it had not yet been released at the time. 8th place: ChuChu TV \u2013 \u201cPhonics Song with TWO Words \u2013 A For Apple\u201d Release date: 06 March 2014 Views: 5.74 billion This video is an English-language children\u2019s song for learning the alphabet. Ten years after its release, the video has reached more than 5.7 billion views. 7th place: ChuChu TV \u2013 \u201cWheels on the Bus\u201d Release date: 24 May 2018 Views: 5.98 billion In 7th place is once again the children\u2019s channel ChuChu TV with the song \u201cWheels on the Bus\u201d. This children\u2019s song vividly conveys the sounds and actions that can be experienced during a bus journey. Although it was released 4 years after the Phonics song, it has collected over 5.8 billion views so far. 6th place: Wiz Khalifa ft. Charlie Puth \u2013 \u201cSee You Again\u201d Release date: 06 April 2015 Views: 6.21 billion The song \u201cSee You Again\u201d is not only the soundtrack title of the 2015 film Fast & Furious 7, but also a dedication to the actor Paul Walker, who died in an accident during filming. Among other things, the song was honored with the Hollywood Film Award. 5th place: Ed Sheeran \u2013 \u201cShape of You\u201d Release date: 30 January 2017 Views: 6.23 billion The chart-topper \u201cShape of You\u201d by Ed Sheeran, his most successful song to date, takes 5th place. To date, the song has reached 6.2 billion views on YouTube and over 3.7 billion streams on Spotify. Sheeran originally wrote the song for another artist \u2013 until his music label convinced him to record it himself. 4th place: Cocomelon \u2013 Nursery Rhymes \u2013 \u201cBath Song\u201d Release date: 02 May 2018 Views: 6.65 billion Just before the winner\u2019s podium is the \u201cBath Song\u201d, a 3D animation or rather an English nursery rhyme about the bathing experience of the little boy Cody. The fun catchy tune is a hit: the clip has been viewed more than 6.6 billion times since 2018. 3rd place: LooLoo Kids \u2013 \u201cJohny Johny Yes Papa\u201d Release date: 08 October 2016 Views: 6.89 billion Third place goes to the English children\u2019s music video \u201cJohny Johny Yes Papa\u201d, which, like the bathing song (4th place), was designed for learning and educational purposes. In it, the toddler Johny tries to get hold of a sugar bowl, but is repeatedly caught by his father. The video has been clicked on over 6.8 billion times since 2016. 2nd place: Luis Fonsi ft. Daddy Yankee \u2013 \u201cDespacito\u201d Release date: 12 January 2017 Views: 8.40 billion One of the most viewed videos of the YouTube era is \u2013 unsurprisingly \u2013 the single \u201cDespacito\u201d by Luis Fonsi and rapper Daddy Yankee. Although released in winter, \u201cDespacito\u201d is considered the summer hit par excellence and one of the biggest global successes in the music industry. In fact, the single was the most-clicked video on YouTube for more than three years, but has now had to settle for second place and \u201conly\u201d 8.38 billion views. 1st place: Pinkfong! Kids\u2019 Songs & Stories \u2013 \u201cBaby Shark Dance\u201d Release date: 17 June 2016 Views: 14.27 billion \u2018Despacito\u2019 was replaced by the popular children\u2019s dance video \u2018Baby Shark\u2019 in November 2020. This is actually an American children\u2019s and folk song, but the well-known version was only recorded in 2016. At the beginning of 2022, \u201cBaby Shark\u201d broke a new YouTube record with over 10 billion views. So officially: here is the most clicked YouTube video of all time. Have fun watching and dancing! This article was translated from German to English and originally appeared on pcwelt.de. Personal Software, Streaming Media",

Price When Reviewed$96 annually for one computer (unlimited storage) Best Prices Today: Carbonite Safe Online Backup Retailer Price Carbonite $95.99 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket Carbonite Safe remains one of our favorite online backup solutions, thanks to unlimited storage for your backups and integration into Windows Explorer. However, we were disappointed to find the latter somewhat degraded in Windows 11. Note that if you hop on Carbonite by March 31, 2024, it\u2019s available at an incredible 75% off, though we don\u2019t know if it will carry over into the renewal cycle. Author\u2019s note: There is some inconsistency in the way OpenText/Carbonite refer to this program, mostly calling it Carbonite Safe, but also Carbonite Backup, and Carbonite Safe Backup. What are Carbonite Safe\u2019s features? Carbonite Safe offers unlimited data backup with file versioning, i.e., it retains older versions of files. Versioning is what makes Carbonite a backup rather than a sync service. All data is encrypted and you may opt to keep the encryption key in your own possession or let Carbonite host it. Further reading: See our roundup of the best online backup services to learn about competing products. The Carbonite client interface is very clean, and very intuitive. The Carbonite client interface is very clean, and very intuitive. The Carbonite client interface is very clean, and very intuitive. By default the program intelligently targets only the most common data and locations: i.e., the Windows documents, pictures, music, etc. folders, though there\u2019s an option to start with no files or folders selected. There are no jobs as such, just the one backup task that uploads data to Carbonite\u2019s online storage farm. Which brings us to a minor gripe \u2014 the lack of a local secondary destination such as an external drive. Local backups are far quicker and easier to restore. If we have any other complaint, it\u2019s the limited online viewing (images) and lack of editing. Carbonite is for backup and storage, not working online. If you fall into that group of users who store essential data outside of the common locations or simply want to choose what you want backed up on your own, Carbonite Safe makes it very easy (Windows 10) to relatively easy (Windows 11) to add source folders and files to your backup. Prior to Windows 11, you could simply right-click on the folder or file and select Carbonite > Back this up. However, thanks partially to Microsoft\u2019s decision to stack context menus in Windows 11, you must now right-click, select Show More Options, then select Carbonite > Back this up. While I\u2019d love to blame this entirely on Microsoft and their seemingly brain-dead determination to increase the number of clicks required to perform every task, WinRAR has managed to insert its options at the root level of context menus. Apparently Carbonite\u2019s developers haven\u2019t sussed out this trick. Note the dots on the folders showing their backup status. You can right-click on any file or folder and add it to your Carbonite backup. Note the dots on the folders showing their backup status. You can right-click on any file or folder and add it to your Carbonite backup. Note the dots on the folders showing their backup status. You can right-click on any file or folder and add it to your Carbonite backup. Carbonite also features a clever method of signaling the backed-up status of a file or folder by superimposing a tiny dot on the icon: orange for backup pending and green for already backed up, etc. See below. Testing on two PCs, these dots were present; however, on our main software testbed they were not. Carbonite tech support indicated that this was likely due to other software having hooked into this ability. As there was no other software monkeying with icons, we\u2019re not sure what the culprit might\u2019ve been. Carbonite skips granular scheduling in favor of a limited form of continuous data protection (CDP). Continuous backup generally means files are backed up soon after they change. In this case, however, there\u2019s a significant limitation in that only one change is backed up in near real time. Subsequent changes to a file may not be backed up for another 24 hours. For instance, if I were working on this article in Word, and saving regularly as is my habit, the final version might not be backed up until the next day \u2014 even if I clicked on the Back up now button in the settings area. Carbonite\u2019s online portal where you can browse backed up files. Carbonite\u2019s online portal where you can browse backed up files. Carbonite\u2019s online portal where you can browse backed up files. Carbonite also offers once-a-day backup, which will be more than sufficient for most users. To be honest, I\u2019d rather set this for the end of the workday (you may choose the hour) than rely on Carbonite\u2019s form of \u201ccontinuous,\u201d which might not back up until well into tomorrow. Unless I want every version I\u2019ve saved, that is. I generally don\u2019t. As previously mentioned Carbonite doesn\u2019t offer a secondary backup to local media, which always makes for a quicker restore process. You can use Windows\u2019 File History or the like in conjunction to facilitate this. Restoring data from Carbonite is as simple as browsing to the virtual drive that Carbonite installs on your PC to act as a portal to your online data. You can also access the virtual drive via the Carbonite context menu with the \u201cOpen this folder in Carbonite Backup Drive\u201d option. Files pending backup are kept in a separate folder on the drive. Oddly, we could see the Carbonite virtual drive when selecting This PC (shown below) from the location tree in Windows Explorer, but it wasn\u2019t listed in said tree as nearly all drives \u2014 physical, virtual, internal, or external \u2014 normally are. The virtual drive Carbonite installs as a portal to your online data. The virtual drive Carbonite installs as a portal to your online data.

You can also restore data by clicking on \u201cGet my files back\u201d or \u201cView my backup\u201d buttons on the main page of the client software. These send you to the web, where you can select data to restore. If this is post system disaster, you\u2019ll of course need to re-install the client software. Alternatively, you can download data directly to any PC you choose from the Carbonite website after signing in with your login and password.

Carbonite also provides clients for iOS and Android. These provide access to files, but don\u2019t back up anything from the phone. Carbonite\u2019s Android app. Carbonite\u2019s Android app. Carbonite\u2019s Android app. How fast is Carbonite Safe Backup? I noticed no performance hit at all while using Carbonite in continuous backup mode to back up about 0.5GB worth of frequently changed files. That\u2019s probably because the backup is not done in real time, or even continuously in the traditional sense. Carbonite told us that files will be backed up within 10 minutes of the first recorded change, but subsequent changes may not occur for up to 24 hours. My last go-round with the program, subsequent changes seemed to upload far more quickly. However, this time there were status notes on the virtual drive saying the \u201cFile will be backed up again in 23 hours\u201d and at eight hours and counting, most were still in the Pending Backup folder. Unless you want to save every version of your highly edited files, you might be better off with a once-a-day backup. The virtual drive Carbonite installs divides source files and folders by their backup status. The virtual drive Carbonite installs divides source files and folders by their backup status. The virtual drive Carbonite installs divides source files and folders by their backup status. Changes were considerably quicker to show up on the virtual drive than the web. This is no doubt due to some caching going on, which is par for the course with software interfacing with online storage such as R-Drive Image and cloud storage managers such as CloudMounter and Mountain Duck, though the lag with those programs is substantially shorter. These experiences refer to the Personal version of Carbonite that we tested. The far more expensive Professional versions may behave differently when it comes to \u201ccontinuous\u201d backup. How much does Carbonite Safe cost? Carbonite\u2019s single-computer Basic plan is $96 a year, the Plus plan with support for a single external drive is $132 a year, and a Prime plan with courier delivery of your backup is $162 a year. All plans include unlimited storage, but the Basic plan doesn\u2019t automatically back up videos and doesn\u2019t support external drives. Basic, which is the plan I tested doesn\u2019t support network locations or logical drives mounted with the cloud management software mentioned above.

Carbonite offers a comprehensive comparison of pricing and features to help you decide. Should you buy Carbonite Safe Backup? Carbonite Safe (Personal versions) is a capable set-it-and-forget-it backup service that eliminates any worries about running out of room when backing up your stuff. It\u2019s a worthy service for the average user. Just take the continuous backup claim with a grain of salt.

    "description": "It might be surprising, but free VPNs are no longer just for PCs. You can also use them to help easily boost your security and privacy game on an Android device. Whether you want extra security while using a public Wi-Fi network, or to get around geo-restrictions for most of your favorite streaming services, a free VPN can help you do it without having to pay for anything. The problem when looking for a good free VPN, though, is that there are a large number of them available on the Google Play Store. So how do you determine which ones are worth your time? Our experts here at PCWorld have tested a slew of VPNs, both for PCs and Android devices, and have curated a list of the best free options you can feel confident in using. Check out our top picks below. Why you should trust us: Here at PCWorld we\u2019ve been testing computer hardware, software, and services since the 1980s. We\u2019re continually testing all of the major VPNs on the market and many lesser-known services in order to curate a list of the very best VPNs across a variety of categories. For a more in-depth guide, you can check out our article on how we test VPN services at PCWorld. Below you\u2019ll find our favorite free VPNs, and below that, helpful advice about what to look for when choosing a VPN for your Android device on your own. And if you\u2019re looking to further upgrade your Android phone\u2019s security, which we highly recommend, be sure to look at our recommendations for the best free antivirus for Android as well. Additionally, you can check out our guide to the best VPNs covering multiple devices. Updated March 26, 2024: We\u2019ve added AVG Secure VPN as our pick for best free trial. Read more below about why we like this VPN and how you best take advantage of their generous free trial offer. ProtonVPN \u2013 Best for unlimited use Pros Fantastic speeds Easy-to-use multi-hop feature Supports TOR over VPN connections Cons Expensive Price When Reviewed: $96 Best Prices Today: $96 at ProtonVPN AG Why we like ProtonVPN If you only have one device to worry about, ProtonVPN is an excellent choice. This free service provides what the company calls \u201cmedium speeds,\u201d meaning you don\u2019t get access to the 10-gigabit-per-second servers that paying customers do. Still, the speeds are just fine. But what you won\u2019t find here are any servers supporting Netflix streaming. That\u2019s another premium feature; however, you can still likely get other streaming services that aren\u2019t as actively fighting against VPNs the way Netflix is. ProtonVPN has an excellent privacy policy, there are no data limits, but you will have to create an account to use this service even when it\u2019s free. ProtonVPN Free provides three country choices. Who should use ProtonVPN ProtonVPN is a great option for anyone with a single Android device who needs a free VPN. Perfect for the one-off phone or tablet user, ProtonVPN provides unlimited data so it can be used all day without worrying about hitting a cap. Plus, privacy-conscious users can take heart that apart from the info required to sign up, ProtonVPN doesn\u2019t collect any other user data.

You won\u2019t get the unlimited usage like you do with ProtonVPN. Instead, you get up to 10GB of browsing per month. But there are no device limits, and you have 10 country connection options. Windscribe requires a confirmed email address to use its free service. Windscribe\u2019s privacy policy is good, but it does track bandwidth usage to keep you to those free limitations. Who should use Windscribe Pro Windscribe Pro\u2019s free Android VPN is best suited for those who need access across multiple devices. Watch out for the data limit though, as you can hit it pretty fast while using multiple devices. Read our full Windscribe Pro review Hide.me \u2013 Best for no sign-up usage Pros Good download speeds Easy-to-use Windows app No-logs promise Cons Speeds were inconsistent in our tests Expensive single year subscription Price When Reviewed: $9.95 per month | $34.95 for 6 months | $59.95 for 27 months Best Prices Today: $59.95 at Hide Me Why we like Hide.me Hide.me has pretty good speeds, and like Windscribe you\u2019re limited to 10GB per month. Hide.me offers five connection choices including two U.S. locations (east and west), Canada, Germany, and the Netherlands. Hide.me doesn\u2019t require an account for signing up, making it seamless and easy to use. Who should use Hide.me Since Hide.me\u2019s free version does not require a sign-up in order to use, it\u2019s good for those who just need a VPN for simple, one-off tasks. Alternatively, if you\u2019re concerned about privacy, not having to enter in any personal information is a huge plus as well. Read our full Hide.me review Speedify 10 \u2013 Best for leveraging both cellular and Wi-Fi Pros Very good speeds Speedify\u2019s failover feature seamlessly transitions between Wi-Fi and cellular networks Cons Privacy policy says it collects some personal information Desktop mode for the Windows app needs work Price When Reviewed: $71.88 Best Prices Today: $71.88 at Connectify Why we like Speedify A solid VPN choice for anyone using the VPN on a phone. Speedify\u2019s specialty is a seamless VPN transition between Wi-Fi and cellular. Typically, when you go between Wi-Fi and cellular the connection drops and restarts, but with Speedify it just keeps on going, which is nice. It also harnesses your Wi-Fi and cellular together to try and boost connection speeds. Speeds are pretty good with Speedify, staying within the top 15 for speeds overall. The downside of this free offering is that you only get 2GB of data usage per month. That\u2019s not much, which is why this is our last suggestion. But if you need something simple for basic web browsing Speedify is well worth a look. Who should use Speedify Due to the small data limit, Speedify is recommended for users who just need a VPN for basic web-browsing or a one-time use. The seamless transition between Wi-Fi and cellular and potential connection speed boost means that Speedify is an extremely convenient way to keep a VPN connection up while on the go or in spotty Wi-Fi areas. Read our full Speedify 10 review AVG Secure \u2013 Best free trial Pros 10 simultaneous device connectionsUnblocks streaming servicesFree 60-day trial Cons Logs some user activity dataNot a lot of extra featuresLong-term only subscription options Price When Reviewed: $53.88 per year Best Prices Today: $4.55 at AVG$5.99 at PCWorld Software Store Why we like AVG Secure VPN It might sound odd to include a free-trial option here, but AVG Secure VPN is a fine VPN service on its own and it provides a 60-day free trial for new users. That\u2019s incredibly generous for a premium service \u2014 most other VPNs only offer one-week free trials at best. The free trial extends to all devices as well so you can use it on both your Windows machine as well as your Android device. AVG is a household name in security software and its VPN lives up to its high-standards. The free-trial gives you complete access to all of the paid features such as 10 simultaneous device connections, over 700 servers across more than 50 countries, and guaranteed streaming service unblocking with specific servers. While the speeds aren\u2019t the fastest we\u2019ve ever seen, they\u2019re good enough for most general online activities. All-in-all, two months for free of AVG Secure VPN is a fantastic deal, just don\u2019t forget to cancel the subscription before the free trial runs out. Who should use AVG Secure VPN Most people looking for a free VPN for shorter-term use will stand to gain a lot from AVG Secure VPN\u2019s free trial. But we think it\u2019s an exceptional choice in particular for those who are traveling for awhile and need a VPN while abroad. By taking advantage of a premium service\u2019s speeds and broad server network you can access all of your streaming content no matter what country you find yourself in and you shouldn\u2019t have to worry about frustrating data caps from other free services. Stream and browse to your heart\u2019s content for no cost, well, at least for 60 days. Read our full AVG Secure review What to look for in a free VPN for Android This will follow a lot of the advice we\u2019ve already given for free stuff when it comes to Android. Google is doing a better job than ever at keeping harmful apps out of the Play Store, but there is still a chance of some random VPN app having malicious intent. Another problem is that even if the app is fine, the service itself may be up to no good. For those reasons we always advise going with a well-known VPN service provider to reduce your chances of running into security issues. Next, you want a free app that is truly free. Not some 7- or 30-day trial that will automatically start charging the card connected to your Play account after the trial period. You should also read over the privacy policy to make sure there\u2019s nothing there you\u2019re going to have a problem with. Finally, you want to make sure the VPN has data limits that suit your needs. How we tested We judge VPNs on a variety of criteria including server network, connection speeds, privacy protections, ease-of-use, additional features, and cost. For a more detailed guide on how we test, check out our comprehensive guide on how we test VPN services. Speed tests are kept as simple as possible. We average the connections between different global locations for any given VPN and then compare them to our baseline internet speed to get a good picture of the overall connection speeds. We thoroughly research and analyze the privacy policies and histories of each VPN and note any outstanding discrepancies or data collection issues. Experience and ease-of-use are subjective, but we try our best to give an accurate representation of how it feels to work with the VPN. Since you don\u2019t have to pay for a free VPN, the value will be contingent upon the trade-offs you\u2019ll need to make and the restrictions it has in place. Free VPNs aren\u2019t a top recommendation, but if you\u2019re going to go that way we\u2019d strongly suggest the VPNs mentioned above. FAQ 1. What is a VPN? A VPN, or virtual private network, hides your identity and encrypts your traffic while browsing the internet. Also, VPN servers are located all across the world, allowing you to connect to a server in another country. So if you want to access location-restricted content like streaming services, you can connect to the appropriate country\u2019s server and gain access to content that may have been locked in your area. 2. How does a VPN work? In short, a VPN hides your IP address by redirecting your web traffic through a remote server hosted by the VPN company. The VPN server then appears to be the source of your traffic instead of your actual location. These remote servers can be located both in different countries around the world or even in your own country. Additionally, your network traffic is encrypted from your computer to the VPN, which adds an extra layer of security. While connected to a VPN and browsing the internet, the VPN acts as a middleman between you and a website. If your computer sends a request to the VPN, it will then pass it along to a website. In return, the website sends its response back to the VPN, which forwards it via a secure encrypted connection to your computer. 3. Is it legal to use a VPN? In the United States as well as most countries, using a VPN is perfectly legal. Some certain websites try to block VPN connections, but that is dependent upon their own terms of usage. It is important to know that while using a VPN is legal, some of the activities done while using a VPN can still be illegal. Activities such as downloading pirated copyrighted content or accessing dark web markets are both illegal with and without a VPN. Android, VPN",

    "description": "Former President Donald Trump is unable to react to the latest gag order with anything other than childish rage, wrote his niece Mary Trump in a new analysis emailed out to her mailing list.The gag order, issued by Judge Juan Merchan, affects the hush money trial, where Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg is charging the former president with bookkeeping fraud concerning a hush payment made to adult film star Stormy Daniels to hide damaging information about an affair from voters in the 2016 election. It's the latest of several gag orders that have impacted Trump in his various legal cases, some of which he was actually fined for violating.Trump had taken to his Truth Social platform just hours before the announcement, noted Mary Trump. \"True to form, Donald responded with the restraint of a toddler by attacking not only Judge Merchan (declaring 'he hates me!' and suggesting he suffered from Trump Derangement Syndrome) but also the judge\u2019s daughter,\" she wrote. ALSO READ: A criminologist explains why Judge Cannon must step away from Trump trial immediately\"'His daughter is a senior executive at a Super Liberal Democrat firm that works for Adam 'Shifty' Schiff, the Democrat National Committee, (Dem)Senate Majority PAC, and even Crooked Joe Biden,' Donald wrote.\"Trump is right to be worried, she added, because \"Judge Merchan goes a step further\" than the gag orders in other cases, \"and covers additional groups of people involved in the court process, including witnesses and even potential witnesses.\"This matters because Trump routinely uses attacks on court officers and witnesses to pump up his supporters and keep the engagement and donations flowing \u2014 something that, if he tries to do now, could land him in a world of legal hurt.\"By taking away Donald\u2019s ability to go on the attack against court staff and witnesses, Merchan is inadvertently stripping Donald of one of his go-to tools to keep his base angry and try to make inroads with disillusioned independents,\" Mary Trump concluded. \"Will this latest development lead to the self-inflicted blow that finally lands Donald behind bars? Maybe. Will it further hurt his election chances? They had certainly better.\"",

    "description": "A rare retrospective of artist Constantin Brancusi, who revolutionized sculpture in the early 20th century but whose works can be extremely tricky to transport, opens in Paris on Wednesday.Born in Romania in 1876, Brancusi arrived in Paris at age 28 and soon after joined the workshop of another historic sculptor, Auguste Rodin.\"Nothing grows in the shadow of large trees,\" Brancusi reportedly said after spending just three months with the creator of \"The Kiss\" and \"The Thinker\".Working directly with wood and marble, and without using moulds, Brancusi launched a radical new approach to sculpture that sought to purify human forms into abstract shapes.\"It is such a pity to have to spoil a beautiful material by hollowing out little holes for eyes, hair, ears,\" he said.More than 120 sculptures and hundreds of sketches, paintings and documents are exhibited at the Pompidou Centre until July 1 -- the first retrospective on this scale in almost 30 years.Brancusi's teetering sculptures are difficult to transport \u00a9 Emmanuel DUNAND / AFPThat is because many of his key works -- particularly the plaster towers balanced precariously on a small base -- cannot be transported without enormous insurance costs.The last retrospective in 1995 was also at the Pompidou, which inherited Brancusi's nearby workshop and entire personal collection.Visitors can explore how his work evolved through different versions of his best-known work, \"The Sleeping Muse\", or a celebrated bust of a child, or his birds and seals.Brancusi \"crosses all the movements of the 20th century,\" said exhibition curator Ariane Coulondre.\"He can be considered one of the fathers of abstract art, without being abstract at all. He never wanted to be part of any movement,\" she added.Tirelessly reworking his sculptures in search of a pure style, Brancusi gave hardly any interviews and refused to have an agent, selling directly to buyers who had to visit his workshop.Brancusi 'never wanted to be part of any movement' \u00a9 Emmanuel DUNAND / AFPThen in 1945, he abruptly stopped work, considering he had nothing more to add.He made no more sculptures in his final 12 years, instead spending the time rearranging his workshop and selling remaining pieces -- but having already transformed the world of sculpture.\u00a9 2024 AFP",

He said, \u201cWhile the wealthiest people in this country have never had it so good, 60% of Americans live paycheck to paycheck.

    "description": "It's looking fairly quiet in the handover from Asia to Europe today. But that has sort of been the theme for most of the week for FX, no? Once again, the dollar remains steady as price action has been rather sideways over the last few days. Here's a snapshot of things currently:While little changed, the immediate standout is USD/JPY after it fell from its highest levels since 1990 yesterday - albeit briefly. The pair hit a high of 151.97, before verbal intervention by Japan helped to keep things in check. And here we are now, holding around 151.30 levels.With little to work with so far on the week, it would seem that traders are adopting a more cautious approach. If anything else, it highlights how data dependent this market is at the moment. It's all about the headlines and we might only get something to scrutinise tomorrow.There will be the US PCE price index as well as Fed chair Powell making an appearance. That being said, it comes during a time when most other markets are on holiday. That is not to mention month-end and quarter-end also being in play today and tomorrow.But for now, there is still an air of calm prevailing but I'd perhaps call it haziness for the most part. It's all about waiting for the next big data and the US jobs report next Friday is the one circled on everyone's calendar at the moment. This article was written by Justin Low at www.forexlive.com.",

    "description": "Award-winning Balcones Distilling joins forces with The Other Art Fair in Los Angeles, Dallas, and Brooklyn to celebrate the artistry in whisky-making and the connection between craftsmanship and self-expression WACO, Texas, March 28, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Balcones Distilling and The Other Art Fair, two trailblazing brands redefining the art and whisky spaces, are thrilled to announce a new partnership for its upcoming circuit of spring fairs. The Texas-based distillery, recently named World's Best Craft Producer of the Year 2024 at the World Whiskies Awards, and the global art fair program are joining forces because of a shared commitment to foster creativity, pursue innovation and champion originality. Balcones is at the forefront of the whisky revolution in Texas and is known for its whisky that comes from a different \"place\". The distillery is forged on a fault line where two opposing landmasses meet, fueling an energy and creative heat that drives Balcones' continuous journey of experimentation and innovation. At the heart of the partnership is the \"Spirit of Balcones: Artist in Residence Program\", a new initiative to empower artists to transcend traditional studios and create artwork that showcases their interpretation of bold, free thinking, reinvention, and embracing the magnetic sense of possibility that comes from expressing your full self. \"The partnership with The Other Art Fair is a natural fit because of Balcones' commitment to creativity and supporting the arts. Led by a distilling team that has a background in art, music, writing, and a head distiller who is a master in both whisky and ceramics, Balcones sees whisky as an art form - a delicate dance between science and soulful expression,\" said Frank Dudley, brand director of Disruptive Whiskies at DIAGEO. In addition to the Artist in Residence program, attendees 21+ years old on site at The Other Art Fair will have the chance to connect with members of the Balcones distillery team, savor hand-crafted Balcones cocktails and try various Balcones whiskies at each fair's sample station. \"This partnership is not only a chance to introduce our whiskies to attendees throughout the three weekends, but it allows us the opportunity to support The Other Art Fair in their mission to celebrate the possibility that comes from limitless creativity and expressing one's full self, an ethos we at Balcones share,\" said Dudley.

    "description": "Richard W. Painter, former chief White House ethics lawyer under President George W. Bush, has expressed concerns about newly-listed Trump Media & Technology Group Corp (NASDAQ:DJT). What Happened: Painter, in an MSNBC opinion piece on Tuesday, warned that the merger could pose significant risks to investors and the country. He cautions that previous Trump ventures have led to substantial losses and bankruptcy. \u201cThe last time a Trump company went public \u2014 with the ticker symbol DJT, no less \u2014 Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts lost more than $1 billion and went bankrupt. There's little reason to think that this deal will end well for anyone other than for Trump,\u201d he said. Painter also highlights potential conflicts of interest if Trump were to secure the 2024 presidential election. With Trump\u2019s social media company, Truth Social, potentially becoming the president\u2019s primary communication tool, the balance of power within the social media industry could be significantly altered.
