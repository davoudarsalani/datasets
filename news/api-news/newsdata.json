    "description": "Few names are as buzzy in Hollywood and beyond as Sydney Sweeney\u2019s. From her rise in the controversial Sam Levinson show Euphoria to her recent roles in rom-com revival Anyone But You and Marvel\u2019s Madame Web with Dakota Johnson, Sweeney seems to be everywhere. However, in her increasing fame, she\u2019s also stirred up controversy. Sweeney has faced rumors of cheating with her Anyone But You co-star Glen Powell, allegedly lied about working as a tour guide at Universal Studios, and become the Ender of Wokeness, per conservatives, after her appearance on Saturday Night Live. A lot of her buzz and controversy has stemmed from discussions, judgments, and consumption of one thing\u2014her body. As Sydney Sweeney noted during her featured speaker session at South By Southwest on March 12, she\u2019s frequently subjected to objectification by people online. \u201cMy DMs are not a safe space,\u201d she said in response to an audience question. \u201cThere is no respect in those.\u201d However, little recognition has been given to her achievements in the industry at only 26 years old. A shining gem outside of the realm of oft-debated nepo babies, Sweeney grew up in a working-class family in the small town of Spokane, Washington. She\u2019s been vocal about her struggles to make enough money as an actor\u2014even though she appears to be highly successful in the public eye. After scoring breakout roles in shows like Sharp Objects and The White Lotus, she\u2019s now turned her attention to producing. Sweeney revealed that she had to convince her parents to let her audition for an indie film being produced in Spokane when she was 10 years old. So naturally, she created a five-year business plan to present to them. She went on to receive a bachelor\u2019s degree in business, something that informs how she navigates Hollywood. \u201cI am a business,\u201d she said. \u201cYou are a business. Every actor is their own company.\u201d A primary intention of Sweeney\u2019s career is to do things that scare her\u2014and her Saturday Night Live performance was one of those frightening experiences. Despite being an actor, Sweeney said she has terrible stage fright. \u201cIt was terrifying, guys. It was so scary,\u201d she said of her guest appearance on March 2. \u201cMy mouth dried up. I\u2019m having panic attacks thinking about it. But it was so fun.\u2019 The fear continues\u2014in more ways than one\u2014with Sweeney\u2019s upcoming role as Cecilia in the nun horror flick Immaculate, which she also produced. Sweeney called the character her most \u201cterrifying\u201d yet, and the film, premiering at SXSW Film and TV Festival on March 12, has been a long time coming. Sweeney initially auditioned for the role at age 16. She didn\u2019t get the part, but soon after the film fell into industry purgatory. Since 2014, however, Sweeney has been launched into stardom and founded her production company Fifty-Fifty Films. Through her effort, the project actually got made. \u201cI got to make it myself, which when I\u2019m sixteen-\u2014I didn\u2019t know,\u201d she said. \u201cNow, I look back, and I\u2019m like, \u2018Syd, you made it.\u201d While producers are often associated only as names on the checks, Sweeney takes a much more personal route, stating that she \u201cparents\u201d her projects. \u201cI\u2019m part of it from the beginning to the end.\u201d Sweeney wants to ensure her work is a space of equality, considering the group effort that the creation of a film or television show requires. \u201cI truly believe that it takes everybody to create something. It\u2019s not just one person,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to be 50-50 with all of my partners. I want to make sure that everyone has equal deals, feels that they are all equally at the table.\u201d Fittingly, she also gave endless thanks to her collaborators, those who taught her important lessons that she\u2019s carrying forward as a leader in the industry. She cites Sharp Objects director Jean-Marc Vall\u00e9e (\u201cHe saw in me what I hoped other people would see in myself.\u201d), casting director David Rubin, and Michael Mohan, the director of Netflix\u2019s short-lived series Everything Sucks!, as empowering collaborators. Mohan and Sweeney reunited to work on Immaculate, which he also directed. She credited her work with Mohan on Everything Sucks! as the moment she found her own voice on set. \u201cI realized I wanted to be part of more than just acting,\u201d she said. And despite the creeps in her DMs, Sweeney is here for the real fans of her craft. As she noted, \u201cBeing able to connect with so many people through my characters is why I do it.\u201d Sign up to receive the Daily Dot\u2019s Internet Insider newsletter for urgent news from the frontline of online.

    "description": "South Korea has remained muted to a new gold rush fueled by various central banks across the world gobbling up the precious metal, raising concerns that Asia\u2019s fourth-largest economy would be one of a handful of nations missing out on the great profit-making opportunity. According to the World Gold Council on Tuesday, total gold holdings by central banks across the globe added 39 tons in January, extending the latest gold run after reaching 1,037.4 tons in 2023 and 1,081.9 tons in 2022. Over the past two years, the total net purchase of gold by foreign central banks exceeded 2,000 tons, with China leading the pack. The world\u2019s second-largest economy has added 300 tons of the precious metal to its foreign reserves since the People\u2019s Bank of China renewed buying it in October 2022. As of the end of 2023, the central bank\u2019s gold reserves amounted to 2,235.3 tons. Its counterpart in India also upped its gold reserves to 803.5 tons in 2023 from 754.1 tons in 2021, while the National Bank of Poland shoveled in 130 tons of the precious metal between April and November last year. Thanks to the revived global appetite for gold, its price hit a new record of $2,195.15 per troy ounce on March 8. Gold prices retreated to the $1,600 level at the end of 2022 from $1,800 earlier that year but started rebounding last year. Considering the latest price hikes, foreign central banks stockpiling gold are estimated to have enjoyed about 30% return from their gold holdings. Korea\u2019s central bank, however, has not joined the new gold race, with its gold reserves unchanged at 104.4 tons since 2013. TOO LATE TO JUMP ON THE BANDWAGON The main reason that the Bank of Korea is hesitant to up its gold stock is the current gold price, which could be at its peak after the recent rally.The Korean central bank bought 90 tons of gold from 2011 to 2013 at an average price of $1,629 per troy ounce. But soon the gold price plummeted, hovering between $1,100 and $1,300 from 2014 to 2018. The BOK was estimated to have logged about 1.8 trillion won ($1.4 billion) loss from its gold holdings in 2015 due to the price drop. The bank also cites the difficulty of cashing out gold because this safe-haven asset is considered a country\u2019s last resort to safeguard against severe national economic meltdown. The sudden disposal of gold is often seen as a red flag for a country\u2019s economy. Another excuse to distance itself from the latest gold run is the lower return of gold investment than other assets. According to the Bank of Korea, the risk-adjusted annual return of gold investment has averaged at 0.26% since 1973, lower than that of US treasury investment at 0.96% and stock investment at 0.44%. MORE ROOM TO GROW Still, some economists argue that the Korean central bank should consider jumping on the latest gold bandwagon as the most precious metal is forecast to extend its rally longer. \u201cThe price of gold, a typical safe-haven asset, is expected to climb higher once the US starts cutting interest rates, and uncertainty over the global economy grows after the US presidential election later this year,\u201d said Seok Byoung-hoon, professor at the Department of Economics of Ewha Womans University. \u201cIt is time for the Bank of Korea to rebalance its asset portfolio.\u201dGold made up only 1.7% of the Asian country\u2019s foreign exchange reserves. But earlier this year, the bank's official said Korea\u2019s central bank does not have an imminent plan to buy more gold for its foreign exchange reserves.

    "description": "U.S. stocks experienced a rise on Tuesday following consecutive losses for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq. What Happened: This positive turn occurred despite a slightly warmer-than-expected February consumer price index. As per CNBC\u2019s Jim Cramer, the market\u2019s gains were largely unrelated to the CPI, but instead tied to \u201ca lot of stocks reacting positively to good earnings per share news.\u201d \"We're getting lucky that the S & P is up like this,\" Cramer said. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon expressed optimism about the U.S. economy on Tuesday, suggesting the Fed should hold off on interest rate cuts until after June. While acknowledging the possibility of a recession, Dimon believes the market is pricing in a soft landing. See Also: This Could Be A Gamechanger For Natural Gas In Europe Cramer echoed Dimon\u2019s optimism, attributing positive equity movements to solid corporate earnings and ongoing interest in artificial intelligence. This was reinforced by Oracle\u2019s (NYSE:ORCL) strong quarter, attributed to AI strength, which boosted shares by approximately 11%.

The Geoff Keighley-run event has quickly become one of the key events on the games industry's calendar, as several notable projects, big and small, have been announced there. With E3 now completely dead, SGF could be poised to take the expo's place as the anchor for the various gaming events that typically take place in early June.

    "description": "Elden Ring is a huge container of weapons, armor, and all sorts of items. One of the most possibly useful consumable items of the bunch is the Celestial Dew, as it bestows upon the player the power to revive NPCs and thus correct some, ugh, possible \"accidents\" that might occur during the main quest. You might end up never needing Celestial Dew, but this is the Lands Between, a place where it's just best to be prepared for everything at all times, so let's see where to find it. Celestial Dew Locations in Elden Ring You can find Celestial Dew not in one, but in many places in Elden Ring, so I'll just leave you with all of the known locations below in descending order of easier to hardest to get: In my opinion, the easiest Celestial Dew you can get is at Raya Lucaria Academy. Simply teleport or reach the Academy's main gate, then follow the direction below to reach a gate and a corpse holding one Celestial Dew. The map doesn't show it very well, but it's just a simple corridor. Just pay attention to the basic enemy that'll drop from the sky to protect the Dew, and you should be fine. You can also buy Celestial Dew from an NPC named Pidia at Caria Manor. To get there, I recommend you teleport to Ranni's Rise, then move to this position: Screenshot by Destructoid That's the exact location of Pidia, but getting there might be a bit tricky as it requires players to find a specific entrance in a lower position. Luckily, there's this Scarab on the way marking the drop point (really). Screenshot by Destructoid From the Scarab's POV, you'll see: Screenshot by Destructoid You'll need to fall down where marked, then a few more times until you get to the roof with this entrance on it: Screenshot by Destructoid You'll find Pidia, a friendly NPC, right by you as soon as you reach the bottom of the ladder. That's one of the easiest ways to get Celestial Dew in the game. The Ainsel River, despite being an underground area, is a great place for Celestial Dew hunters because you can either buy them from the merchant there or get two additional dews at the Uhl ruins: Screenshot y Destructoid Another great option is Nokron's Eternal City. The Ancestral Woods is a great starting point: Screenshot by Destructoid Once there, just drop down to the roof, move forward, drop down again, and turn right. At the corner, you will be able to see a Dew-carrying corpse. Screenshot by Destructoid Another good place is Leyndell. Get to the site of grace on the Sanctuary, walk up the tree to the upper floor, move to the rooftop, and re-enter the sanctuary through the window. On that floor, you'll find a chest with the Erdtree bow and then, if you keep going past the chest, you'll find a dead guy holding one Celestial Dew. Screenshot by Destructoid I believe this would arguably be the easiest Celestial Dew to get by itself if not for the fact that it's in a late-game area, and thus not immediately ready for players to get. You better start stocking up on Celestial Dew because Elden Ring Shadow Of The Erdtree comes out on June 21, and things are about to get wild.

    "description": "In recent news, Chubb Ltd (NYSE:CB) CEO, Evan Greenberg, has stood by the company\u2019s decision to underwrite the appeal bond of former President Donald Trump in a defamation lawsuit filed by E. Jean Carroll. What Happened: Greenberg, in a customer communication, clarified that Chubb\u2019s role as the surety does not imply support for any party involved in the case. \u201cWe don't take sides, it would be wrong for us to do so and we are in no way supporting the defendant,\u201d he stated, according to a report by The Hill. Last week, Trump signed paperwork for one of Chubb's divisions to underwrite his $91.63 million bond as he appeals the recent civil verdict against him for defaming Carroll, an advice columnist, by denying her sexual assault claims. Greenberg stressed that Chubb\u2019s decision was based on supporting the rule of law and not influenced by personal feelings. He also indicated that Trump\u2019s bond is fully collateralized, although the specifics of the assets put down by Trump remain undisclosed.

    "description": "South Korean rental platforms have become a headache for private equity firms, with their declining profits and dim business outlook making them hard to sell.In 2019, a handful of small-sized homegrown private equity houses snapped up domestic rental service companies each for around 100 billion won ($76 billion) to emulate MBK Partners\u2019 eye-popping exit from the sector leader Coway Co. that produced more than a four-fold return after five years of investment.Five years on, Cactus Private Equity and Daishin Private Equity are struggling to divest of BS On Co. a company that leases office equipment and home appliances. Their consortium put it up for sale in September last year, but has not yet to find its new owner due to a big valuation gap with bidders, according to investment banking industry sources on Wednesday.The two homegrown investment firms jointly acquired BS On for 100 billion won in 2019. Since then, operating profit at BS On has decreased to 11.9 billion won in 2022 and 12.1 billion won in 2021, versus 16.4 billion won in 2019.SV Investment and AJ Capital Partners were another Seoul-based PE houses betting on rental platforms.Thy took over MostX, formerly Modurental, for 100 billion won in 2019. It leases products ranging from household goods to massage devices and pet care products from some 150 brands.Despite its diverse assortment of leasing products, the company\u2019s operating profit more than halved to 4.2 billion won in 2022, compared to 10 billion won in 2020. Sales decreased to 65.6 billion won versus 91.5 billion won over the same period. AJ Capital Partners is a unit of AJ Networks and AJ Rent-A-Car and has no relation to the Tennessee-based investment firm with the same name. In 2019, PS Alliance and Dream Security, a cybersecurity and authentication service company, acquired Korea Rental Corp. for 115.0 billion won. The rental company has been faring poorly since their purchase.Industry observers said domestic rental platforms appear to have reached their growth limit.They are highly dependent on manufacturers, which are now switching to directly leasing their products after building brand awareness on rental platforms.High interest rates have taken a toll as well. Rental companies borrow money from banks or other financial institutions, offering subscription contracts with their customers as collateral. Elevated financing costs have held them back from swiftly responding to the hit product cycle.North Asia-focused MBK Partners reaped more than a fourfold return, or over 1 trillion won, from the exit of its controlling stake in Coway, a rental company of air and water purifiers and bidets, five years after investment.By Jin-Eun Hahazzys@hankyung.com Yeonhee Kim edited this article",

    "description": "Passwords stored in Chrome are convenient, but they can also expose you to risk. Share your device with someone else, and they can log into any website with saved credentials. At least, they can if you haven\u2019t enabled Chrome\u2019s built-in protections. On Windows PCs, you can use Windows Hello to lockdown access to your Chrome passwords. When turned on, you\u2019ll have to enter a PIN or use a biometric authentication method (like a fingerprint or webcam) before Chrome will fill in a login form with your user name and password. Here\u2019s how to enable the feature.

You should be able to skip to Step 2. (However, if you don\u2019t see the option for Windows Hello in Google Password Manager\u2019s settings, return to this step.) The Sign -in options in Windows 10. In the Windows 10 or 11 start menu, type sign-in options \u2014 or open your Settings app and use the search bar to find the sign-in options. Your PC won\u2019t support the biometric methods of Windows Hello authentication without a compatible fingerprint reader or webcam, but a PIN code should be available to set up. Note: Any Windows Hello method you set up will allow you to log into your PC. If you have concerns about the security of the biometric options, you can stick with just a PIN code \u2014 ideally one that\u2019s at least six numbers long. Step 2: Head to Chrome\u2019s settings In a Chrome window, click on the three dot icon in the upper right of the screen. Then choose Settings > Autofill and Passwords > Google Password Manager. In the left navigation bar, select Settings. You can also type chrome://password-manager/settings into the address bar of a Chrome tab and hit enter. Step 3: Turn on Windows Hello protection Flipping that toggle will turn on Windows Hello verification on this PC.PCWorld In the Google Password Manager settings, find Use Windows Hello when filling passwords. Click on the toggle to enable this feature, then enter your PIN code or use an alternate Windows Hello method to authenticate the change. The toggle will then move to the right and turn blue. After you\u2019ve turned on Windows Hello verification, a pop-up window will appear with an authentication check before Chrome will fill in your saved login info.

Why? You\u2019re safer from headaches if that Google account is ever compromised or lost. Plenty of excellent options exist, both free and paid \u2014 but the paid options offer nicer perks, like being able to give emergency access to your passwords, more sophisticated forms of two-factor authentication, and easier password sharing. These options can integrate with your phone and PC, so you can still seamlessly create, store, and use your credentials.

Beyond Windows Hello verification, you can also use antivirus software (like Avast One) to safeguard against malicious apps that try to steal saved browser passwords.

    "description": "Macworld Few computer-related disasters can quickly drain the color from your face quicker than losing a document you\u2019ve been busily working on. Whether your Mac crashed or froze, you forgot to save, or you accidentally clicked on delete, all might not be lost. We\u2019ll show you how you can recover that vanished Word document. If everything is working as it should then it\u2019s quite hard to lose a file in Word. Word has an autosave feature that means that in the event of an accident, you should still have the bulk of your work, except for the last ten minutes. Our top tip would be to save a document as soon as you start working on it to ensure that it autosaves regularly. But that\u2019s not why you\u2019re here. If you\u2019ve opened Word and can\u2019t find that document you were working on don\u2019t panic! There is a good chance that you can get your document back. In this article, we\u2019ll run through the various ways you can recover an unsaved or deleted Word document. How to recover an unsaved Word doc We\u2019ll run through a few scenarios that you might have been confronted with to recover that Word document for you. As we said above, the good news is that Word for Mac has a built-in autosave feature called AutoRecover. This means that Word is quietly saving the document you are working on without you needing to manually tell the software to do so. For this feature to function properly, however, you\u2019ll need to initially save the document with a name, and then Word will make incremental saves every ten minutes. However, even if you haven\u2019t done this Word will still save your document and you should be able to find a version of it in the AutoRecover folder. Below we will run through how to get to the AutoRecover folder and some other steps you can take to recover your document. Scenario 1: You are working on a Word document and you have to restart your Mac without a chance to save first Solution: Open Word again to see an autosaved version of your document. The good news is that if you are using an up-to-date version of Word then just opening up Word again should recover the document\u2014or at least a very recent version of it. This is because Word autosaves your document \u2013 even if you haven\u2019t saved it yet. This is even though at the top of the Window you will see an AutoSave button, which may be off. (Switch that button on and you\u2019ll see a request to save your document.) Scenario 2: Opening Word doesn\u2019t load up the document you were working on Solution: Find it in the AutoRecovery folder. Open the Finder. Click on Go in the menu. Click on Go To Folder. Paste in the following: ~/Library/Containers/com.microsoft.Word/Data/Library/Preferences/AutoRecovery This will open your AutoRecovery folder where you will find the AutoRecovery versions of your documents even though you didn\u2019t save them. Having found the document you may not be able to open it, in which case you may need to try the steps in the next scenario\u2026 Scenario 3: Word won\u2019t open the AutoRecovery version of your document Solution: Drag the file into a different text editor app When you try to open the AutoRecovery file (either by clicking on it or trying to drag it onto the Word icon in the Dock) you may see a message claiming that Word experienced an error trying to open the file. One of the suggestions may be to open the Text Recovery Converter. Here\u2019s what we did: Open TextEdit. Drag the file onto the TextEdit icon in the Dock. Copy the text into a new file in Word. Scenario 4: In a moment of madness you clicked on Don\u2019t Save or Delete Solution: Find the most recent version in the AutoRecovery folder The great news is that even if you didn\u2019t save your Word document \u2013 even the best of us have clicked Don\u2019t Save by accident when we were closing documents \u2013 you can recover it from the AutoRecovery folder. However, it is really difficult to locate as it is locked away in a hidden Library folder. Luckily there is a simple way to view that folder. Just click on Go > Go To Folder in the Finder\u2019s Go menu and paste the following: ~/Library/Containers/com.microsoft.Word/Data/Library/Preferences/AutoRecovery This will open your AutoRecovery folder where you will find the AutoRecovery versions of your documents even though you didn\u2019t save. If you are thinking you might be able to locate that folder directly in the Finder, notice that the ~ symbol means that it is a hidden folder, so it\u2019s easier to cut and paste the above address. Scenario 5: You made a mistake and want to go back to an older version Solution: Browser through recent versions It\u2019s not always the case that you lose the whole document. Sometimes you might lose some of the work you have done, which can be just as traumatic if you\u2019ve spent a lot of time on it. As long as you have made an initial save of the document you should be able to browse the version history: With the Word document open click on File. Select Browse Version History. In the right-hand column, you\u2019ll see the version history. Locate a version of the document from before you made the mistakes you wish to correct. Click on Open Version. This will open a second copy of your document. Either click on Restore (to go back to this version of the document) or Compare (if you don\u2019t want to recover the whole document and just want to copy and paste the bit you need). Other ways to recover a lost Word document If the above doesn\u2019t work, or your version of Word is older than the current one, try the steps we outline below. Check the Trash In some cases, your file might be missing because you deleted it. It\u2019s easily done when you are trying to make room on your Mac and you remove a load of old files only to realize that one of them was crucial. Luckily this isn\u2019t as disastrous as it sounds. The document might still be found in the Trash. Click on the Trash can icon in the Dock to open it. You\u2019ll now see the contents of the Trash. Look for your file. If you click on a file and press Space Bar you may be able to see a preview of it. If you don\u2019t see your file look for a \u2018Recovered Items\u2019 folder in the Trash. It\u2019s possible that your file is located in that. If it\u2019s there you\u2019ll need to right-click on it and choose Put Back. This will place the file back in the folder where it was originally saved and you can continue to work on it. Try data recovery software There are third-party apps that may be able to help you recover your document if the above advice doesn\u2019t help. Disk Drill Disk Drill will scan your storage for free and show you the files that can be recovered using the tool (so you don\u2019t have to pay before you know if it will be able to find your file). To recover the file you\u2019ll need to pay for the full version of Disk Drill here (\u00a383.28/$89). EaseUS EaseUS Data Recovery Wizard will scan the drive or volume where you lost the files. Once the scan is complete you can view Unsaved Documents. Double-click to see a preview of the file and click Recover to recover it. There is a free version that has a 2GB recovery limit, which may well be enough for your needs. Get it here. (Full version costs $69.95 a month, cancel at any time, or $99.95 a year) For details of some other apps that might help you recover your files, check out our round up of the best data recovery apps, which also includes Stellar Data Recovery, RecoverIt, Data Rescue. Find AutoRecovery for older versions of Word Since you might not have the latest bersion of Word we\u2019ll detail the steps below for you to follow to locate that Word AutoRecovery folder. How to find the AutoRecovery folder in Word 2016 Here\u2019s how to find AutoRecover in Word 2016: In Word 2016, the AutoRecovery folder is buried deep in the system and requires your Mac to display hidden files, so the first step is to reveal these secret folders, to do so we recommend following our advice at the link below, although the key combination to use is cmd + shift + . (full stop). Read: How to show hidden files and folders on a Mac. With this done you\u2019ll need to open Finder then click on the Home icon in the left-hand column (it\u2019s usually your name). Now navigate to the following folder: Library/Containers/com.microsoft.Word/Data/Library/Preferences/AutoRecovery/ If you have any AutoRecovery files then they will be in here. One thing to remember is that AutoRecovery files are temporary and only exist if they think that Word shut down unexpectedly. So, if you clicked Don\u2019t Save rather than Save when you were closing the document there won\u2019t be an AutoRecovery file for it. How to find the AutoRecovery folder in Word 2011 If you are using Word 2011 it\u2019s easy to locate the AutoRecovery folder: Click on the File option in the Menu bar then search for Autorecover. If you use Word often then there might be a few different Autorecover files, so check the date to see which one matches your missing item. Once you\u2019ve found the document just click on it to open it up, then remember to save it again under a new name. Even if you don\u2019t find your document in the AutoRecovery folder, it may not be the case that it isn\u2019t there. Files in the AutoRecover folder don\u2019t always show up. We have first-hand experience of this. In the past, our Mac has \u2018helpfully\u2019 saved a Word document in the Office 2011 AutoRecovery folder. This would not be an issue, except for the fact that when we then accessed the folder (just a quick search in Spotlight for Office 2011 AutoRecovery) the files were nowhere to be seen. As you can see from this screen grab, the most recent file in our AutoRecovery folder was from 5 March, but we know that there are more recent files saved there. The problem with the AutoRecovery file is that it is located in a Library folder that isn\u2019t visible by default, and that will have some impact on whether your files are visible or not. Fortunately, there is a way to locate the file. How to view files in Office 2011 AutoRecovery folder Go to the Finder, and press Alt (or Option) while selecting Go from the menu at the top of the page. This will make the Library folder visible (if you don\u2019t press Alt you won\u2019t see it \u2013 and you have to keep Alt pressed or it will vanish). Click on Library to open the Libray folder. Locate the following folder: Application Support > Microsoft > Office > Office 2011 AutoRecovery. When you see the Office 2011 in this view you should be able to locate your file. Recover old versions of documents via Time Machine While Word has its own Version History that only works if you have saved the file at some point. Plus, if you have subsequently deleted the document by accident you can\u2019t open it to open an older version. In that case, you could try Time Machine. If you have a Time Machine backup on an external drive you can roll back to a time when a deleted or corrupted file was still on your system. Go to the folder where you\u2019d hope to see your file, or an earlier version of your file. Open Time machine and flick back through the day, weeks or months to see if your file is there. We\u2019ll keep our fingers crossed for you. Follow our Complete guide to Time Machine for instructions on how to recover your files. If you are unfortunate enough not to have a backup routine then we suggest beginning one immediately. Macs are very reliable machines, but there is always a risk of something going wrong, so it\u2019s best to protect yourself against potential disaster. Try looking at our How to back up a Mac feature that highlights several solutions for this essential practice. What if you never saved your file \u2013 if in a moment of madness, you clicked on Don\u2019t Save rather than Save? It happens! Can you retrieve your file? Recover lost docs from the Temporary folder Your Mac also has a folder where it might temporarily keep files. The Temporary folder isn\u2019t easy to find though. To find the Temporary folder, use Terminal (find it in Applications > Utilities > Terminal, or Spotlight search for Terminal by pressing Command + Space. Open Terminal Type: open $TMPDIR Press Enter. Inside this TMP folder, you should find a folder called Temporaryitems. It\u2019s possible that your document might be inside. Tips to avoid lost Word files Avoid this nightmare happening again \u2013 follow the tips below. Save first, save often It goes without saying that you should save frequently especially if your Mac can be a bit unreliable. You may be able to rely on Word autosaving for you, but remember that you have to save the file first to really benefit from Autosave. Change the autosave frequency A helpful thing to know is that you can reduce the gaps between autosaves on Word for Mac. By default they are set at ten minute intervals, but it\u2019s easy to make them more frequent. In Word go up to the Menu bar at the top of the screen and click on Word. From the dropdown menu select Preferences and then in the Output and Sharing section you\u2019ll see a disk icon named Save. Click this and you\u2019ll now be able to adjust the time between saves by entering a value into the \u2018Save every X minutes\u2019 box at the bottom. While it might be tempting to set it as low as possible, bear in mind that Word\u2019s performance could be be hampered slightly if it\u2019s saving every minute, especially if you are working on a large file. Experiment to see what setting works best for you. You may also find one of these articles helpful: How to recover deleted files. Want to get to know Word better? Read our Top tips for Word for Mac.

    "description": "Another indie title has been released that\u2019s giving players some much-needed relaxation: Summerhouse. There\u2019s no combat, no movement, and nothing to stress you out except the limitations of your own imagination. Plus, there are collectibles, and that\u2019s always a good thing. Summerhouse, a game by independent developer Friederman, is all about building using a limited number of tiles and decor items. You start the game with only a few tiles to build with. As you place them down, you\u2019ll start to get new pieces featuring people and animals that will bring your creations to life--if you're lucky. Screenshot by Destructoid Summerhouse is about building houses and feeling the vibe Summerhouse is reminiscent of playing with building blocks, either as a child myself or with my daughter now. The possibilities are only limited by what you can imagine - you can build a giant castle or a tiny cottage, hang laundry between the windows and put climbing vines all over the walls. Or, if you feel like it, you can build a skyscraper that looks like it would topple over in reality. The limit does not exist. You technically don\u2019t even need walls. You can place windows, doors, and endless decor pieces wherever you like, as long as it's within the building boundaries set out by the level. There\u2019s no limit to how many objects you can place, so you can make incredibly cluttered designs that somehow end up looking as though they were always meant to look that way. At least, that\u2019s the hope. Screenshot by Destructoid Although Summerhouse lacks stress, it doesn\u2019t lack frustrations, though they have more to do with expectations vs reality than with the game itself. I\u2019ve played a lot of hours of Summerhouse, and I have found it difficult to create buildings that live up to the ideas I have in my head when starting a build. That said, I have, at times, begun to play and then somehow lost three hours before I look at the clock again. It\u2019s incredibly easy to get lost in the simple art style, and if you\u2019re not a fan of the default pixelated look, you can turn that off in the settings to give the game a smoother look. The wind blowing through the trees in the background and the quiet, calming music adds to the atmosphere, allowing you to simply relax and wile away the hours. Getting new building blocks in Summerhouse is not only easy but enjoyable, and some of them are absolutely adorable. For instance, by placing some power lines next to some swaying grass, two pieces that you have from the outset, you\u2019ll be rewarded with a new block featuring a little sheet ghost who comes to visit at night time. Screenshot by Destructoid You can make up your own stories for the people who show up, like the dog who sits on the steps waiting for his owner or the mysterious caller who stays on the pay phone all day. Summerhouse is a game of imagination, and it\u2019s got a shocking low base price on Steam of $4.99 USD. At that price, what have you got to lose?

    "description": "Ever since we started controlling our computers with a mouse, icons have been central to our operating systems. By clicking on small, simple images representing a folder, trash can, or magnifying glass, we can quickly and easily trigger certain events. The appearance of the icons is controlled by the operating system, and in most cases there is no reason to change. It would be impractical, for example, if the trash can suddenly resembled a calculator or the search tool became a folder. However, there are times when it is actually practical to change the appearance of the icons \u2014 for example, when it comes to your own folders and shortcuts. If you have a lot of icons, it can be more attractive and clearer if they don\u2019t all look the same. Many of us have an image memory, and if the folders have different colors, it will be easier to find them. Apple has realized this, and in a Mac it is easy to change the color of the folders. In Windows it\u2019s a bit more complicated, but it\u2019s possible. Choose your own image Yes, you don\u2019t even have to settle for a color change. You can freely choose what an icon should look like. For example, if you have a folder with documents related to a horse club you are a member of, you can replace the yellow folder icon with a picture of a horse. Similarly, you can create letter and number icons to quickly orientate yourself to the right folder. Or why not let the shortcuts to the web pages you often visit have the site\u2019s logo. The sky\u2019s the limit, but there is one important thing to keep in mind. When you change the icon on an image folder, the preview function disappears. If you use the regular default icon, you will also see thumbnails of the contents of the folder, but this works if you change the icon. Step by step 1. Open the settings Right-click on the folder or file you want to use and select Properties. If it\u2019s a folder, select the tab Customize and if it is a shortcut, click on the tab called Shortcut. Either way, you will now see an option called Change icon. Foundry 2. Change to a default icon You will now see the default icons that are built into the system, and what they are depends on what you want to change. Browse to the one you want to use, click on it and then select OK. Then press OK once more to confirm. Foundry 3. Use your own icons If you are not satisfied with any of the built-in icons, you can use a so-called ico-file. There are many sites where you can download these online and one of the best is Iconfinder: Browse to www.iconfinder.com and click on Icons. Foundry 4. Search for icons\u2026 On Iconfinder there are 6 million icons to choose from and you can find the right one by searching or browsing through categories. Some icons cost money, but when searching, you can tick Free to get only the free options. Foundry 5. \u2026and download them Once you\u2019ve found an icon you like, you can save it, but it\u2019s important that you choose the ico format. You can do this by clicking on Other > ICO and then selecting Download in ICO. Make sure to save the file in a place where you can find it. Foundry 6. Change icon Open icon Properties (as in step 1) and press Change icon. Select the Browse and locate your ico file. Press Open and a thumbnail of your icon will appear. Make sure it\u2019s highlighted and press OK twice. Now you can see how the old icon has been replaced by a new one. Foundry 7. Convert optional images\u2026 If you are not satisfied with the existing icons, you can create your own. You can take an existing image and convert it to the ico format. You can do this in image programs such as Xnview, but there are also websites that do this for free, such as Online Convert. 8. \u2026or create from scratch You can create your own icons using web services such as Favicons. This is a simple web-based drawing program for creating Windows icons. You can do this by drawing with your mouse or by importing an image file from your hard drive. When you are satisfied with the result, click on Download to save the image as an icon file. As you can see, Favicons is a slightly outdated service in terms of design.

    "description": "The rocky development of Blade has led to another shakeup for the Marvel Cinematic Universe movie. Actor Aaron Pierre isn't attached to the project anymore. Speaking with Variety over the weekend, Pierre explained that he's \"no longer part of that.\" He previously appeared in Old and will voice Mufasa in The Lion King prequel that's set to premiere this December. Pierre was one of a few names linked to Blade, which will star Oscar winner Mahershala Ali in the eponymous role. X and Pearl star Mia Goth reportedly joined the MCU movie almost a year ago. Shortly thereafter, True Detective creator Nic Pizzolatto was brought on to help with the script. But the Hollywood strikes put Blade on hold--along with most movies last summer. However, Blade faced a lot of setbacks previously as well.For instance, in 2022, Blade lost director Bassam Tariq just months before the film was set to go into production. That led to the vampire-centric movie getting shut down. Blade was originally announced in 2019 at San Diego Comic-Con.Late last year, Marvel shifted around a handful of movies, including Blade. While the movie was previously planned to premiere on Valentine's Day next year, Blade is currently slated to debut November 7, 2025. It sounds like Blade might be rated R, with new director Yann Demange hinting that it will follow in Deadpool 3's footsteps in that department.For more on the character, check out GameSpot's retrospective on 1998's Blade starring Wesley Snipes.",

    "description": "Gone are the days of backpacks overloaded with binders and the chronic hand-cramps from trying to write as fast as possible. Nowadays, a good laptop elevates your productivity and allows you to keep all your important lesson materials in one place. Whether you\u2019re new to campus or heading into your final year, having a laptop that\u2019s capable, sturdy, and portable \u2014 with good battery life, natch \u2014 will help keep you on top of your studies, or gaming (no judgement). Why you should trust us: It\u2019s in our name, PCWorld. We\u2019ve been reviewing laptops for decades, with exacting standards applied to all facets of the user experience, from performance benchmarks to features to the rigors of daily use. Our experts know their stuff and have curated a comprehensive list of the best laptops for college students, with their particular needs in mind. After you finish looking over our recommendations, be sure to hit our daily updated roundup of the best laptop deals to try and score your favorite laptops on sale. Or check out our roundup of the best laptops for even more recommendations. We\u2019ve also got a great article about the five laptop features that matter most. Updated March 18th, 2024: Since our last update, we\u2019ve published a number of laptop reviews, which we\u2019ll include below. We\u2019ve also added new sections as well as new pros and cons. The best ultraportable laptop for students pick was replaced by the Acer Swift Edge 16 and the MacBook Air (M3) was added as the best MacBook for students. MacBook Air (M3): The MacBook Air (M3) truly wowed us with its 19-hour battery life and spacious Liquid Retina display. It\u2019s also lightweight and portable, weighing in at just over three pounds. MacBook Pro (M3): The MacBook Pro (M3) Pro is considered a good work tool for everyday tasks thanks to the 11-core CPU and the 16-core Neural Engine. It also runs quiet and is noticeably faster than its predecessors. Alienware m16 R2: The Alienware m16 R2 is a \u201cdo it all\u201d 16-inch laptop for gamers who also want a portable PC with good battery life. Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon: The ThinkPad X1 Carbon (Gen 12) is an amazing business laptop with a lightweight form factor and a stunning display, but it comes at a premium price point compared to competing laptops. Samsung Galaxy Book3 Pro 360 \u2013 Best overall for students Pros Stunning OLED display Long battery life Solid inking 1080p webcam Good audio Cons Webcam effects are iffy Price When Reviewed: From $1,699.99 Best Prices Today: $969.99 at Amazon$1899.99 at SamsungNot Available at Best Buy Why we like the Samsung Galaxy Book3 The Samsung Galaxy Book Pro 360 offers a lot of goodies for the price ($1,699) such as a convertible form factor, a 1080p webcam, a superb OLED display, and long battery life. It also weighs just 3.66, so it\u2019s light enough to take with you from class to class. The 1080p webcam will make you look fine as heck during remote learning sessions and the 13.5 hours of battery life means you\u2019ll be able to keep working well into the evening hours. Everyday performance is snappy thanks to the Intel Core i7-1360P CPU and 16GB of memory, and the 16-inch AMOLED touch display features a resolution of 2880\u00d71800 and a refresh rate of 120Hz, resulting in vibrant visuals. This laptop really has it all. Who should buy the Samsung Galaxy Book3 Any college student that\u2019s looking for a well-rounded laptop. You can use it like a tablet for easy note taking or prop it up like a tent for sharing information or calling in for remote sessions. Multitasking is a real breeze thanks to the display\u2019s 16:10 aspect ratio, which means the screen is taller and more square than rectangular. While we like the way the 1080p webcam makes you look in video calls, some of the effects such as Eye Contact are finicky to use. Aside from a couple of minor nitpicks, we feel as though the Samsung Galaxy Book3 Pro 360 is the best choice for most people. Read our full Samsung Galaxy Book3 Pro 360 review Lenovo Flex 5i \u2013 Best Chromebook for students Pros Great build quality Vibrant touchscreen display Fast performance Nice typing experience Cons Stylus not included Average battery life for a Chromebook Heavier than expected Price When Reviewed: $499 Best Prices Today: $329 at Best Buy Why we like the Lenovo Flex The Lenovo Flex 5i is a great Chromebook because of its convertible design, fast performance, superb typing experience, and touchscreen display. The chassis has a luxurious aluminum finish on it, which makes it feel three or four times as expensive. The 360-degree hinge that connects the display to the rest of the laptops feels strong and like it won\u2019t wear out anytime soon. The keyboard is also a dream to type on and easy to adjust to, and the 1200p display produces sharp, colorful visuals. Sure, it\u2019s heavier than we expected right out of the box and the stylus isn\u2019t included, but those are small trade-offs in the grand scheme of things. Overall, this is a really well-rounded machine. Who should buy the Lenovo Flex We feel as though the Lenovo Flex 5i is a good option for those who prefer using Google\u2019s ecosystem. The beautiful touchscreen display and the convertible design really gives it the edge over other Chromebooks and even some Windows laptops, as you usually see those features in machines that cost much more. While the nine hour battery life is a little below average for a Chromebook, it\u2019ll still last you a full school day and then some. At the end of the day, the Lenovo Flex 5i\u2019s list of compromises is quite small. Read our full Lenovo Flex 5i Chromebook Plus review Acer Aspire 3 \u2013 Best budget laptop for students Pros Spacious keyboard with number pad HD webcam Solid video playback performance Decent business app performance Workday-long battery life Cons Small 128GB storage drive A little heavy Price When Reviewed: $329.99 Best Prices Today: $299.99 at Amazon Why we like the Acer Aspire For under $500, the Acer Aspire 3 laptop provides reliable performance as well as a durable build. It\u2019s zippy enough for day-to-day productivity like binging your favorite shows on Netflix, checking e-mail, and so on. There\u2019s even a full-sized keyboard and a 1080p screen. It even smashed the competition with a Cinebench R15 score of 1,925, edging out the Acer Aspire Vero 14, which has comparable hardware. By the way, the Cinebench benchmark measures how well a laptop handles processor-intensive workloads. Who should buy the Acer Aspire Anyone who\u2019s on a restricted budget! To get more specific, we feel as though the Acer Aspire 3 is a good option for students because it\u2019s affordable and a good performer. The HD webcam also produces \u201cclean, crisp video\u201d according to our review, which means you\u2019ll always look your best in remote learning sessions. The 40 watt-hour battery is quite good too, lasting a total of eight hours on a single charge, so you don\u2019t have to stop and go outlet hunting as you\u2019re traversing from class to class. Read our full Acer Aspire 3 review MacBook Air (M3) \u2013 Best MacBook for students Pros Excellent battery life Great combination of price, features, and performance 256GB SSD is now two NAND chips, maintaining performance Cons Expensive memory upgrades Dual external display support requires closed lid Price When Reviewed: $1,299 (base) Best Prices Today: $1,234 at Amazon$1299 at Adorama$1299 at Apple Why we like the MacBook Air From the outstanding battery life to the spacious Liquid Retina display, the MacBook Air (M3) received high marks across the board. It comes with an 8-core CPU (M3) and a 10-core GPU as well as two Thunderbolt 4 ports and a 66.5 watt-hour battery. Performance is similar to the MacBook Pro (M3), which means it can blitz through school work and casual use tasks. The only difference between the two is that the MacBook Air doesn\u2019t have fans, resulting in quieter operation. This laptop also managed a whopping 19 hours on a single charge, which is great news for those with jam-packed schedules and have zero time to plug into the nearest outlet. Who should buy the MacBook Air Anyone who prefers MacOS over other operating systems! The battery life is incredible and the laptop itself weighs just a little over three pounds, which means you can easily take it anywhere with you. The 15-inch Liquid Retina (LED) screen is considered a step-down from the MacBook Pro\u2019s Liquid Retina XDR (mini-LED) display, but that doesn\u2019t mean it doesn\u2019t look great, especially for everyday use. The $1,299 price tag is also reasonable for the performance and features. However, the 8GB of RAM is a little light. Acer Swift Edge 16 \u2013 Best ultraportable for students Pros Gorgeous OLED display Lightweight Strong CPU performance Cons Mediocre battery life Weak audio Average keyboard and touchpad Price When Reviewed: $1,299.99 Best Prices Today: $949.99 at Best Buy$1,299.99 at Amazon Why we like the Acer Swift Edge In addition to its lightweight form factor, the Acer Swift Edge 16 is also the perfect combination of affordable and powerful. This sub-$1,000 laptop weighs just 2.71 pounds and is capable of out-performing machines that cost hundreds of dollars more (like the Acer Swift Go 16) due to the AMD Ryzen 7 7840U CPU. The 2000p OLED machine is lovely, too. According to our review, it \u201cdelivers an infinite contrast ratio and deep, inky black levels that produce convincing shadows in dark scenes.\u201d Whether you\u2019re watching your favorite flicks or working on an important assignment, you can count on a gorgeous picture either way. Who should buy the Acer Swift Edge If you\u2019re looking for a lightweight ultraportable with strong performance, the sub-$1,000 Acer Swift Edge 16 is the one to pick. It\u2019s thin and light enough to toss in a bag, and the display is fantastic for school work or watching YouTube. The 54 watt-hour battery is rather small, but it still manages a respectable seven hours on a single charge. For under a grand, we believe the trade-offs are reasonable. Besides, you won\u2019t find many large screen laptops at this price point. Read our full Acer Swift Edge 16 review Asus TUF Gaming A16 Advantage Edition \u2013 Best budget gaming laptop for students Pros Impressive battery life Gorgeous 16:10 display Rugged chassis Cons Keys feel a bit soft 720p webcam is disappointing Price When Reviewed: $1,099.99 Best Prices Today: $949.99 at Best Buy Why we like the Asus TUF Gaming The Asus TUF Gaming A16 Advantage Edition is something of a rare gem in the sand dune. This specific model exhibits strong graphics performance as well as long battery life, which is unusual for a gaming laptop. Most gaming laptops last only a couple of hours on a single charge. Well, the Asus TUF Gaming A16 Advantage Edition and its 11 and a half hours of battery life is out here changing the script. That\u2019s more than a full school day. Also, thanks to the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4050 GPU, it also managed 123 frames-per-second in the Rise of the Tomb Raider benchmark. That\u2019s pretty darn good, especially for a sub-$1,000 gaming laptop. Who should buy the Asus TUF Gaming The Asus TUF Gaming A16 Advantage Edition is a great option for those who like to game after class. The pricing is reasonable and you\u2019re getting reliable graphics performance as well as a spacious keyboard and decent battery life. It\u2019s also a good purpose machine, so you can use it for coursework and day-to-day productivity. With a solid Cinebench R20 score of 589, it should have \u201cno trouble running lightweight apps and programs,\u201d according to our review. The Lenovo LOQ 15, which we reviewed recently, stands as another solid budget option. It\u2019s more than capable of 1080p gaming thanks to its more powerful RTX 4060 and the design is very sci-fi inspired. That said, it didn\u2019t nab the top pick because of the poor battery life (not unusual for a gaming laptop) and limited port selection. Read our full Asus TUF Gaming A16 Advantage Edition review How we tested The PCWorld team puts each and every Windows laptop through a series of benchmarks that test GPU and CPU performance, battery life, and so on. The idea is to push the laptop to its limits and then compare it against others we\u2019ve tested. Chromebooks, on the other hand, go through a series of web-based tests. It wouldn\u2019t be fair or possible to run the same kinds of tests on a Chromebook, as they\u2019re Chrome OS-based machines. Below, you\u2019ll find a breakdown of each test and the reasons why we run them. For a much deeper look at our review methodology, check out how PCWorld tests laptops. Windows laptops PCMark 10: PCMark 10 is how we determine how well the laptop handles lighter tasks like web browsing, word processing, spreadsheets, and so on. HandBrake: HandBrake is more intensive than PCMark 10. It basically measures how long a laptop\u2019s CPU takes to encode a beefy 30GB file. Cinebench: Cinebench is a brief stress test of the CPU cores. It does this by rendering a 2D scene over a short period of time. 3DMark: 3DMark checks if 3D performance remains consistent over time by running graphic-intensive clips. Video rundown test: To gauge battery life, we loop a 4K video using Windows 10\u2019s Movies & TV app until the laptop dies. Chromebooks CrXPRT 2: The CrXPRT 2 benchmark tests a Chromebook\u2019s battery life. Speedometer 2.0: This test determines a Chromebook\u2019s web browser performance. It simulates this by adding, completing, and removing a to-do list. Basemark Web 3.0: This benchmark gauges how well a Chromebook can handle web-based applications. Kraken 1.1: Kraken 1.1 is a JavaScript performance benchmark. Jetstream 2: Jetstream 2 is a combination of WebAssembly and JavaScript benchmarks. This is a way to gauge how well a Chromebook runs advanced workloads. What to look for in a laptop for college The first thing to consider is budget. How much are you willing to spend on a laptop? If you\u2019re working with an inflexible budget, Chromebooks are a good option. They\u2019re affordable and designed to handle everyday tasks like writing papers, working on spreadsheets, and so on. Chromebook prices can range anywhere from $200 up to $1,000. If you want to spend a bit more, laptops with convertible touchscreens (otherwise known as 2-in-1s) offer a great deal of functionality. You can flip the screen around and use it like a tablet or prop it up like an easel for watching movies. Things like navigating your e-mail or watching Netflix will require more RAM. We recommend springing for 8GB of RAM or more. 4GB of RAM is fine and good for web browsing and basic office work, but 8GB is better for having more tabs open and whatnot. Plus, applications like Google Chrome and Spotify tend to eat up a lot of memory. Most people can get by with 4GB in a pinch if you\u2019re on a tight budget, but you won\u2019t be able to multitask as much. The final thing is a decent keyboard. In college, you\u2019re going to be spending a lot of time typing. Depending on your personal preference, you may want either a full or short travel keyboard. Mechanical keyboards, for example, normally have longer travel. This helps prevent accidental keystrokes. The keys also give a lot of tactile feedback, as they bounce back after they\u2019re pressed down. FAQ 1. Which laptop size is best? This is mostly personal preference. Students who bring their laptops to class or intend to travel a lot should consider a smaller, more portable size. Anything in the neighborhood of 13- to 14-inches is recommended. However, if you want to use your laptop for gaming, then you should consider something in the 15- to 17-inch range. It\u2019s also important to keep in mind the weight of the laptop before buying it. Ultra thin laptops can weigh a featherlight two pounds while hefty gaming rigs top the scales at three or four times that\u2014not exactly something you want to carry in a backpack everyday. 2. How long should a laptop last on a single charge? If you\u2019ve got a jam-packed schedule, you\u2019ll probably be running from class to class with very little downtime in between. That\u2019s why we recommend a laptop with a long-lasting battery. We recommend something that\u2019ll last 7 to 10-plus hours on a single charge, unless you want a notebook that can play games on the side\u2014gaming laptops are notorious for their shorter endurance, even during everyday tasks. That 7 to 10 hours is a good figure if you plan on taking your laptop with you everywhere. 3. What about processing power? Most students will be able to get by with an Intel Core i3 or i5 processor. You don\u2019t need anything mega powerful for everyday tasks and school work. However, if you\u2019re using more graphically demanding programs on the regular, then you may want to spring for an Intel Core i7 or i9. It all really depends on your workload.

    "description": "The 2004 Dawn of the Dead remake, written by James Gunn and directed by Zack Snyder (in his directorial debut!), celebrates its 20th anniversary this week. Both critically praised and commercially successful at the time of its release, the film, along with 28 Days Later, helped popularize the concept of sprinting zombies over their shambling, slouching, Romero-made counterparts. They created panic and urgency, and they made for an opening sequence that was worth the price of admission by itself.Like many great horror films, Dawn of the Dead doesn't start with horror. Our main character, Ana, is a nurse, and she's wrapping up a long shift at the hospital. What's great about this opening sequence--of her talking with co-workers and killing time--is how mundane it is. This is not load-bearing dialogue, and the actors don't deliver it theatrically, as if to imply narrative stakes. We know that Ana is about to have the worst day of her life. But she doesn't know that. Nothing feels urgent or pressing, because from her perspective, it isn't.She doesn't know it's the last time she's going to see her co-worker, or the neighborhood girl, or her husband. Even the shower sex between them, tastefully filmed behind the steaming glass, feels domestic and perfunctory.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "At a GlanceExpert's Rating ProsNow supports Apple SiliconNew Guided Edits, with new Search toolMoving elements add animation to still photosConsNew mobile and web apps still in betaExpensiveOur VerdictThe 2024 Photoshop Elements update breathes new life into the app and is a good upgrade for owners of previous versions. It also confirms Photoshop Elements\u2019 position as one of the leading photo-editors for non-professional users. Price When Reviewed$99.99 Best Prices Today: Adobe Photoshop Elements Retailer Price Macworld Software Store $69.99 View Deal Adobe $99.99 View Deal Macworld Software Store \u2013 Elements/Premiere Bundle $109.99 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket Photoshop Elements isn\u2019t the cheapest photo editor available, costing $99.99/\u00a386.56, but it\u2019s still great value for money as it\u2019s able to use technology from the professional version of Photoshop to provide some really powerful tools for editing your photos and adding creative effects. Adobe also sells a bundle that includes both Photoshop Elements and Premiere Elements for video editing for $149.99/\u00a3130.36, which can save you even more money. (Read our review of Premiere Elements.) The key to Photoshop Elements\u2019 success is that it manages to combine powerful editing tools with a user-friendly interface that makes it easy for amateur photographers to achieve impressive results. Adobe\u2019s 2022 version introduced new artificial intelligence techniques \u2013 which Adobe refers to as Sensei \u2013 which could automatically perform editing tasks that might normally require hours of work. Further reading: 5 free Photoshop alternatives for Windows The app has always had a selection of filter effects that could make photos look like paintings, using media such as oil paints or watercolors, but Sensei introduced a new set of Artistic effects that aim to mimic a variety of popular artistic styles, such as cubist and post-impressionist. These aren\u2019t always entirely successful \u2013 I suspect Vincent Van Gogh is spinning in his grave right now \u2013 but they\u2019re fun to experiment with. One nice touch here is that you can apply the artistic effect to the entire photo, or just to the subject or background, which is a nice way of emphasizing particular aspects of a photo. If your artistic ambitions are a little more modest you can apply some simple animated effects \u2013 known as Overlays \u2013 such as falling snowflakes or flickering flames, to your photos and then save your work as a short video clip that you can upload to social media. One of the things that sets Photoshop Elements apart from many of its rivals is its use of Guided Edits, which give you step-by-step help in using some of the app\u2019s most powerful tools. One really powerful Guided Edit that was introduced in 2021\u2019s update is the ability to alter the aspect ratio of a photo by extending the background of a photo. If you\u2019ve got a photo with an attractive background, such as a beach or some leafy trees then you can clone part of the background and use it to extend the background further \u2013 perhaps to turn a square photo into a wider landscape shot, or to extend a sunny blue sky upwards for an upright portrait shot that you can use on social media. And, of course, no social media account is complete without some cute pet pics, so Photoshop Elements includes a Guided Edit specifically for enhancing photos of animals. You can adjust the lighting and color in a photo, focusing either on your pet or the background, or add a subtle vignette effect. There\u2019s also an option to remove blemishes, such as mud or dirt, and to remove glare from the pet\u2019s eyes. The use of Sensei artificial intelligence continued with Photoshop Elements 2023. As well as applying animated overlays to an entire photo, this feature allows you to create moving elements that animate just one specific section within a photo. You could select part of an image, such as a waterfall or the flowing mane of a horse, and animate your selection to make the image look more dynamic and eye-catching. The program\u2019s selection tools can help you to select either the background of an image, or elements in the foreground, and you can simply draw a line to indicate the direction of movement (so the waterfall flows down, rather than upwards). You can also adjust settings such as the speed of movement, and preview the animation effect before exporting the animated image file as an MP4 video clip or as an animated-GIF. The Guided Edits section of the program also gained new tools for adding overlays, new background images, or enhancing the appearance of the sky in your photos. And, with so many Guided Edits now available, we were pleased to see that this update added a new Search tool that helps you to quickly locate the Guided Edits you need by searching for keywords such as \u2018crop\u2019 or \u2018sky\u2019. Adobe Adobe Adobe For Mac users, the most important feature in Photoshop Elements 2023 was its native support for Apple Silicon, with Adobe claiming that the program will now run 45 percent faster on Macs that have M1 or M2 processors. And if that wasn\u2019t enough to persuade you to upgrade, then this year\u2019s new Photoshop Elements 2024 proves to be one of the biggest updates the program has received in quite a few years. As you might expect, there are a number of new AI features, but the program\u2019s interface and layout have also been \u201crefreshed and redesigned\u201d too. Like the full version of Photoshop, the Elements version now has both Light and Dark modes, as many experienced photographers prefer working in Dark mode, while other people simply find it easier on the eyes. The various fonts and icons used in the main interface have also been updated to improve visibility too. These interface changes are more than just cosmetic, though, with other useful features such as the new Quick Actions panel, which is now available within the program\u2019s Quick editing mode. The Quick Actions panel gathers together a number of existing editing tools, but also gains new AI features, such as the ability to quickly select or change the background or sky in an image, or to smooth out fuzzy artefacts in compressed JPG files. Adobe Adobe Adobe One of the headline features in Photoshop Elements 2024 is Match Color, which is available within the FX panel in both Quick mode and the Advanced mode for experienced users. In Quick mode you can simply choose a number of presets that allow you to quickly change the colours and tonal balance within a photo, while Advanced mode also allows you to import your own photos and copy the colour settings from one photo to another. And, when you\u2019re working in Advanced mode, you can use a new Search tool to browse through Adobe\u2019s library of free stock photography to find images that you can use in your own work. This year\u2019s update also gains a new Guided Edit called Add Text, which makes it easier to use the program\u2019s text tools and effects. You can quickly add horizontal or vertical text, apply text to a selection, or make text follow a path that you draw with a freehand pen. You can add drop shadows, graduated colours and other effects with a quick click of your mouse, and even change the angle of lighting that you apply to the text. And, for social media mavens, there\u2019s a new Photo Reels tool, which is similar to an old-fashioned slide-show that flicks through a series of photos, but is very much focused on social media and provides a series of templates for use on Instagram, Tiktok and other services. When you create a Photo Reel you see a simple timeline view that allows you to arrange photos in sequence, adjust the size and aspect ratio of each photo. You can also adjust the playback speed of the photo reel, and add text, graphics and filter effects. Foundry Foundry Foundry Buying the desktop version of Photoshop Elements also gives you access to its companion mobile app for iOS and Android, and a web app that runs in a browser on any device. The mobile app allows you to upload photos and videos from your smartphone or tablet, and also provides you with 2GB of free online storage for your files. You can then quickly import these files into the desktop versions of Photoshop Elements when you\u2019re ready to get down to some serious editing work. The web app works in a similar fashion, and also includes some simple tools for quickly creating slideshows and collages without having to use the full version of Photoshop Elements. Just remember that both the mobile and web apps are still in their beta test phase, so make sure you keep backups of your photos and files just in case. All these new features ensure that Photoshop Elements 2024 is a much more worthwhile upgrade than some versions in recent years. Pricing is unchanged, at $99.99/\u00a386.56 when bought directly from Adobe, but there\u2019s a 30-day trial available so that you can experiment for a while before buying. Verdict In recent years, some of Photoshop Elements\u2019 annual upgrades were starting to look as though they were running out of ideas, but the 2024 update breathes new life into the app and is definitely a good upgrade for owners of previous versions. It also confirms Photoshop Elements\u2019 position as one of the leading photo editors for non-professional users. This review originally published on Macworld.com. Mac, MacOS, Personal Software",

    "description": "It sounds too good to be true. The ability to smoke meats, seafood and more inside your kitchen without risking your security deposit doesn\u2019t seem like something that should be possible. GE Appliances begs to differ. The company debuted the final version of its GE Profile Smart Indoor Smoker just before CES, quickly nabbing the attention of this wood-fired-grill reviewer. Thanks to a unique filtration system, the unit captures smoke while cooking and only expels warm air (out of the front). After getting a small taste (literally one bite) in Vegas of what the smoker could do, I\u2019ve spent the last few weeks cooking a variety of proteins to see if the $999 device is as compelling as it seems. Design The GE indoor smoker has the stature of a small mini fridge. It\u2019s not far off from the quick-cooking ovens behind the counter at Starbucks either. Its glossy front is two-thirds door, complete with viewing window, while the remaining space is dedicated to the control panel and pellet waste bin. Up top is a small sliding door at the front left for adding food-grade wood pellets. The sides and back look plain and boring, like a countertop oven or microwave, but that\u2019s just fine. The contraption is short enough to fit under cabinets, but you\u2019ll want to leave space on the sides and back for radiant heat. At the bottom of the front, there\u2019s a vent where the GE indoor smoker expels warm air while it\u2019s cooking. The company also provides a small drip tray that slides under the front edge to help keep your counter clean. Over to the right, a display sits up top to show you status, probe temperature, smoker temperature, cook time and smoke level. You turn a knob to navigate settings and menus and then press to confirm your choices. Back and Start buttons flank that dial on the left and right sides respectively. There\u2019s progress and status lights that encircle the knob too, adding a visual cue during preheating, cooking and more. Under the knob is a smattering of buttons to get to certain functions quickly. These include settings, cancel, the interior light, activating the Clear Smoke feature and toggling between probe temperature and cooking time on the display. There\u2019s also a power switch in this group and they\u2019re all touch-based rather than clicky physical buttons. Inside, supports snap onto the sides to hold the three moveable racks in place. A drip pan slides into the bottom to catch grease and other debris. To keep tabs on food temps, a probe snaps into a jack at the top right of the cooking chamber and can be stored on the outside of the smoker via a magnetic holder when not in use. Lastly, the GE Profile Smart Indoor Smoker\u2019s prime piece of tech, the Active Smoke Filtration system, is on the back interior wall. Setup and use Photo by Billy Steele/Engadget Another benefit of the GE indoor smoker is that it\u2019s ready to go out of the box. There\u2019s no seasoning or burn-off required to get rid of oils or other manufacturing leftovers. Simply snap the rack supports in place, slide in the racks, put the drip pan in the bottom and that\u2019s it for the cooking chamber. Once you add pellets in the slot up top and fill the water tank to the indicated level, the smoker is almost ready to start cooking. One more step you\u2019ll need to do the first time you cook, or anytime you empty the pellet chute, is to prime the auger. This ensures that the device will start producing smoke quickly and efficiently, giving your food as much time as possible to bathe in it. Afterwards, you can choose a preset or opt to go full manual mode (called Customize) and you\u2019re off and running. GE has dialed-in selections for brisket, pork ribs, pork butt, wings, chicken and salmon. These offer the necessary time and temperature settings for proper cooking, including a recommended smoke level. Additionally, you can determine the duration of the cook based on time or internal food temperature. Once either of those are achieved, the GE Profile Smart Indoor Smoker can automatically go into Keep Warm mode until you\u2019re ready to eat. Photo by Billy Steele/Engadget A word on larger cuts: you\u2019ll need to portion them out in order to make them fit. For things like ribs and brisket, you can easily slice them in half and make use of the rack system. I did chuckle when reading the recipe book as GE says you can fit a 18-pound brisket in this smoker. That single cut of beef would take up most of the cooking area on some pellet grills, so you definitely have to cut it to fit here. And even then, the pieces will be quite large. Pork butts fit with ease, as do whole chickens. If you prefer to spatchcock your birds to cook them, that won\u2019t work here. However, you could easily do two chicken halves. I was also able to accommodate nearly four pounds of wings (flats and drums) across the three racks. Basically, any meat you\u2019d smoke on an outdoor grill can be done on this unit, but some of them will take a bit of extra planning, and maybe a few cuts, to get them to fit. How does the GE Indoor Smoker work? After you\u2019ve selected your preset or manually entered your cooking parameters and pressed start, the GE indoor smoker will ask you to confirm that you\u2019ve added both pellets to the chute and water to the waste bin. From there, the device will preheat to the appropriate temperature before it begins producing any smoke. This will allow you to put your food inside without having to clear the smoke immediately. The last step is to push the start dial once more to begin the smoking process. Before you open the door while things are cooking, you\u2019ll need to activate the Clear Smoke function to avoid setting off any alarms in your kitchen. This takes 10 minutes, so you\u2019ll have to plan ahead a bit \u2013 unless you don\u2019t mind smoking up the room. I mention this because you will have to flip and rotate nearly everything you prepare in this thing to make sure it cooks evenly. I learned this lesson the hard way with a pork butt that burned on top but was undercooked near the bone. A simple flip and front-to-back rotation for everything about half-way through the process remedied the issue for everything I cooked after that, but it is an extra step that outdoor grills don\u2019t require. You can leave a pork butt on a pellet grill unbothered until it\u2019s done, but those have fans pushing heat around the cooking chamber. GE says it didn\u2019t opt for a convection fan in this unit because of how it would\u2019ve affected the flow of smoke. Can you taste the smoke? One of the biggest questions I had about the GE indoor smoker is if you\u2019d actually be able to taste the smoke. The unit burns just enough wood pellets to fill the cooking chamber with smoke, which is enough to give proteins a kiss of flavor. It\u2019s certainly not as intense as what you get on an outdoor grill, but it\u2019s definitely there. Since the GE Profile Smart Indoor Smoker does an excellent job of regulating temperature, the texture of all of those meats, and even seafood, is consistently moist and tender. Smoke flavor was most prominent in wings, chicken and salmon, but I could taste it in larger cuts of meat, too. GE allows you to adjust the smoke level from 0 to 5, so you can crank it all the way up to maximize the flavor if that\u2019s your culinary preference. I almost always set it to level 5. Let\u2019s talk about smoke rings One thing you won\u2019t see on meat cooked low-and-slow in the GE Profile Smart Indoor Smoker is a smoke ring. This is the pink area along the outside of sliced meats that most people think indicates how well smoke has penetrated the food. That\u2019s actually a misconception. A smoke ring is caused by a chemical reaction with nitric oxide gas produced by burning wood or charcoal. It isn\u2019t by any means an indication of the level of smoke flavor, or even good barbecue. Outdoor pellet grills, offset smokers and even a Weber kettle with charcoal will create a noticeable smoke ring on things like ribs, pork butts and briskets. The GE Profile Smart Indoor Smoker will not. That\u2019s because the appliance isn\u2019t burning wood pellets as the heat source \u2013 it\u2019s only using them to flavor the food. That takes very little fuel, and it also requires barely any heat to smolder them. You can actually fake a smoke ring if you really want one for the \u2018gram, but overdoing it can ruin your food, so tread carefully. For that, you\u2019ll need a small amount of something that contains sodium nitrate and sodium nitrite, like Morton\u2019s Tender Quick. It\u2019s the stuff that\u2019s used to cure pastrami, where the pink color is essential. Cleanup and maintenance Photo by Billy Steele/Engadget Unlike most outdoor grills, all of the racks and rack supports inside the GE Profile Smart Indoor Smoker are dishwasher safe \u2013 simply by virtue of being small enough to fit. Since you\u2019ll have to wipe down the interior of the cooking chamber with a solution of either mild soap and water or vinegar and water, not having to hand-wash what\u2019s sure to be the dirtiest part of the machine is a plus. The drip pan is made out of a similar material to roasting pans you\u2019d use in an oven, so you can probably stick it in the dishwasher too. I have been doing this with no issues so far, but you can always wrap it in foil before you start smoking for easy cleaning. You\u2019ll also need to empty the water tank that collects and extinguishes the spent pellets after each use, though the smoker may ask you to do so midway through longer sessions. You\u2019ll need to strain out the remaining wood particles from the water before discarding the cooled solids in the trash. Since the water container doesn\u2019t touch any food, a quick wipe and rinse is all that\u2019s needed here. GE says you\u2019ll occasionally need to clean the pellet ramp to ensure proper smoke production. The company includes a small brush that\u2019s used to keep unwanted debris out of the cooking chamber. Simply lift the smoke inlet cover on the right side of the cooking area and use the brush to remove anything that\u2019s accumulated there. The company also recommends that you wipe the interior light after each use. I assume that\u2019s so you\u2019ll be able to see well during the cooking process, but GE doesn\u2019t elaborate on why you need to do it. GE Profile SmartHQ app The Smart Indoor Smoker works with GE\u2019s SmartHQ app to allow you to monitor the small appliance over Wi-Fi. With this software, you can monitor smoker and food temperatures from anywhere, as well as activate the 10-minute Clear Smoke process from the sofa. The app also lets you turn the internal light on and off, but that\u2019s really about it. You can\u2019t actually adjust the smoker temperature without walking over to it. The smoker comes with a recipe book, but it would\u2019ve been great if those (and many more) were available inside the app. Those instructions, paired with the ability to send the appropriate cooking info to the device, would give new users a lot of ways to get started beyond the simple protein-specific presets. I would also love it if there was a way to trigger the Keep Warm function or shut down the smoker remotely. You know, for the times when I get too excited about putting pulled pork in my mouth and forget to turn the machine off before sitting down at the table. Is it better than an outdoor grill? Photo by Billy Steele/Engadget While it\u2019s tempting to compare the results from the GE Profile Smart Indoor Smoker to those of a pellet, charcoal or wood-burning grill, it would be like discussing apples and oranges. Since all of the other options have an open flame and use significantly more fuel as the primary heat source, the smoke flavor is much more intense. They also require a lot more planning. First, you\u2019d need dedicated outdoor space where those grills and smokers will be safe to use. You\u2019ll also need to consider the added cleaning and maintenance needed to keep them running well. All of these outdoor grills have a wider temperature range, so they can be used for more than just smoking. You could use a pellet grill, for example, to do everything from brisket to searing steaks. Ditto for charcoal or wood-burning units. And if you factor in Wi-Fi-enabled features, outdoor grills typically allow you to adjust temperature in addition to just monitoring it. Some of them even offer advanced tools like the Super Smoke mode from Traeger or the ability to send recipes to the grill as part of step-by-step guidance. All this considered, the GE Profile Smart Indoor Smoker is still a good option for people who can\u2019t have an outdoor smoker due to rental agreements or a lack of space. You\u2019ll certainly need to plan ahead on how to store the appliance when you\u2019re not using it. But, the fact that you can put it in your kitchen opens up the ability to cook barbecue, smoked wings, tasty seafood and more that you otherwise wouldn\u2019t be able to. It\u2019s not entirely a \u201cset it and forget it\u201d type of device, and there are some hoops to jump through in terms of rotating things during the cook. However, you won't have to spend hours babying the meats the cooking starts. Wrap-up The GE Profile Smart Indoor Smoker works just like the company describes. The only real nuisance is having to flip and rotate foods to make sure they\u2019re cooked properly. I really wish the company was more up-front about this somewhere other than the troubleshooting table and recipe book. It\u2019s a key action that shouldn\u2019t be left to trial and error. Even with that caveat, the device produces noticeably smoky flavor in a range of foods, albeit in a more-subdued way than what an outdoor grill. Presets make it easy to get started and the manual mode will provide an open playground once you gain some experience. This won\u2019t replace your pellet or charcoal grill, but that\u2019s not really the point. It lets people who can\u2019t own one of those make some tasty barbecue inside their kitchens. You just have to find a place to store it, or give up previously allocated countertop space, between smoke sessions.
