    "description": "An interview with the outgoing House Speaker",
    "content": "Ever since the election, Nancy Pelosi says, congressional Democrats have been begging her to remain as their leader. Of course, she knew what they were really doing: currying favor, just in case. \u201cOur members were just exploding my phone to stay,\u201d she says, \u201cwhich is a nice thing, because if I don\u2019t stay, then they\u2019ve gotten the points for saying \u2019stay,\u2019 and if I do\u2014\u201c she trailed off, laughing. No matter what she decided, they knew it would be in their interest to be on her good side going forward. For two decades, it has been in every congressional Democrat\u2019s interest to stay in Pelosi\u2019s good graces. Since winning her first leadership position in 2001, she has ruled the House Democratic caucus with an iron fist and a velvet glove, keeping her fractious party in near-lockstep during historically tumultuous times. From the Iraq War to the financial crisis, through health-care reform and government shutdowns, through two presidential impeachments, a pandemic and an insurrection attempt, she has been a constant force and consummate operator. No national politician of her era can match her combination of legislative prowess, vote-counting savvy, negotiating skill, and fundraising ability. [time-brightcove not-tgx=\u201dtrue\u201d] On Thursday, it was finally time to move on\u2014sort of. Shortly after noon, she gave a brief speech on the House floor, announcing that she would not seek re-election as leader of the House Democrats. It was time, she said, \u201cfor a new generation to lead the Democratic caucus that I so deeply respect.\u201d Yet she couldn\u2019t bring herself to step away completely: she owed it to her constituents in San Francisco, she said, to stay on as a rank-and-file member of Congress and finish her two-year term. Like the man who fakes his own death and then sneaks into the funeral, she would stick around to see how her people tried to get along without her. Chip Somodevilla\u2014Getty ImagesNancy Pelosi waves to colleagues while being nominated as the next Speaker of the House during a swearing in ceremony for the 110th Congress in the House Chamber of the U.S. Capitol in Washington, DC., on Jan. 4, 2007. Just after her speech, the 82-year-old House Speaker sat at a white-clothed table in a small, ornate room off the House floor known as the Board of Education, a hidden chamber where former Democratic Speaker Sam Rayburn used to hole up and relax. Then-vice president Harry Truman was playing cards with Rayburn here in 1945 when he learned that FDR had died and he would become President. One wall Rayburn had painted with a Texas seal; on two others, Pelosi recently added her own touches: a painting of the Golden Gate Bridge, and a tribute to women\u2019s suffrage. Pelosi was contemplating the not-quite-end of the era and struggling to unwrap a package of chocolate-chip cookies. \u201cWhat was important to me was how we did in the election, because we were on a bad path,\u201d she told a small group of reporters. \u201cStorming the Capitol, really? And the reaction of Republicans, not taking a stand? And I knew we could win.\u201d Her party had just lost the House, weeks after a crazed intruder broke into her California home and bludgeoned her husband with a hammer. But it hardly felt as if Pelosi was giving up in defeat. In an election that history and many forecasters predicted would deliver a Republican wave, Democrats surprisingly held their own. The resulting GOP majority will be a narrow one, with the Senate remaining in Democrats\u2019 hands. The Oct. 28 attack on Paul Pelosi, the Speaker\u2019s husband of 59 years, influenced her decision to remain in Congress, but not in the way many people thought. \u201cIt was not, \u2018Oh, well, since they did that, I can\u2019t even think of something else,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cNo, it had the opposite effect. I couldn\u2019t give them that satisfaction.\u201d Read More: Nancy Pelosi Doesn\u2019t Care What You Think Of Her. This steely tenaciousness, this refusal to let others decide her path, is a running theme of my biography of Pelosi. It has been the hallmark of her political career, from forcing her way into the male-dominated ranks of congressional leadership to standing up to former President Donald Trump. As the youngest child and only daughter of three-term Baltimore mayor Thomas D\u2019Alessandro, politics was in Pelosi\u2019s blood; she first set foot on the House floor as a young child, when her father was serving in Congress. But when she finally ran for office herself at the age of 47\u2014after raising five children and serving for decades as a political fundraiser, strategist and volunteer\u2014it was from a different coast, under a different name, with a political identity all her own. Deanne Fitzmaurice\u2014San Francisco Chronicle/Getty ImagesNancy Pelosi at election headquarters on primary election night, on April 7, 1987. Ask Pelosi about her legacy, and the first thing she\u2019ll mention is the Affordable Care Act. However flawed and incomplete the 2010 law\u2019s guarantee of universal access to health care may have proven, it represented the fulfillment of a century of liberal aspirations, and the pinnacle of Pelosi\u2019s legislative craft. She moved mountains to get it through the House, at one point nearly breaking down in tears as she begged a group of liberal feminists to swallow an unsavory compromise on abortion funding. Then, after a special election robbed Democrats of their supermajority in the Senate, she urged then-President Obama not to give up on the historic legislation. \u201cIf the gate\u2019s closed, you go over the fence,\u201d she said at the time. \u201cIf the fence is too high, we\u2019ll pole-vault in. If that doesn\u2019t work, we\u2019ll parachute in. But we\u2019re going to get health-care reform passed for the American people.\u201d Though most of the drama around the bill\u2019s passage revolved around the Senate, it never could have happened without Pelosi\u2019s determination and drive. Win McNamee\u2014Getty ImagesSpeaker of the House Nancy Pelosi stands behind President Barack Obama as he signs the Affordable Health Care for America Act during a ceremony with fellow Democrats in the East Room of the White House on March 23, 2010. She did it knowing there might be a political cost, and indeed there was. Republicans gained 63 seats in the House in the 2010 midterm elections, an election in which Pelosi was a central figure. Republicans made her the subject of millions of dollars\u2019 worth of attack ads across the country, capitalizing on their base\u2019s visceral loathing of her and giving Peosi unusual prominence for a congressional leader. But Pelosi believed in gaining power not for its own sake but in order to do something with it. Obamacare is part of a legacy that includes two decades of liberal policy victories, from allowing gay people to serve openly in the military to the historic climate investments of this year\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act. \u201cThis is a very difficult job,\u201d she told us. \u201cYou have to really know how to be a legislator.\u201d These legislative successes were all the more remarkable for the era in which they came. Faced with unrelenting Republican opposition, she held together the diverse Democratic caucus and drove a hard bargain in negotiations across the aisle. After Donald Trump became president, she led her party back to power, becoming Speaker for the second time in 2019 in the middle of a government shutdown over border-wall funding. Pelosi refused to budge, and Trump soon capitulated. She would go on to impeach him twice while simultaneously negotiating with his Administration to secure trillions in COVID-19 relief funding.

Pelosi rejects the notion that she bears any blame for the toxic state of politics. \u201cI don\u2019t take any responsibility for what the Republicans have done to the Congress. This is not about gridlock,\u201d she says. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about some sort of equivalence between Democrats and Republicans. They are anti-science, anti-government, and that\u2019s where they are.\u201d The GOP\u2019s lack of decency was apparent in many Republicans\u2019 reaction to her husband\u2019s attack, Pelosi says. \u201cJust think if your spouse were in that situation and people would make a joke of it, like it was funny,\u201d she added. \u201cCollecting money for bail for the perpetrator, putting out a conspiracy theory about what it was about. It\u2019s so horrible to think that the Republican Party has come down to this.\u201d This attitude, she says, was part of what voters recoiled from the midterms. Mark Wilson\u2014Getty Images (2); Chip Somodevilla\u2014Getty Images; Jim Watson\u2014Pool/AFP/Getty Images Pelosi never groomed a successor, something for which she was often criticized. Ambitious Democrats languished for decades waiting for an opening in House leadership. She has often expressed the view that power is never given but must be taken by those who seek it. \u201cI didn\u2019t think that was the right approach, to anoint somebody,\u201d she told us Thursday. \u201cIt\u2019s really important for people to have the legitimacy that they were chosen by the members.\u201d A free-for-all appears unlikely. Pelosi\u2019s longtime deputy Steny Hoyer, a fellow Marylander who has known her since they worked for the same Senator in 1963, announced Thursday that he would also stay in Congress but not in leadership. Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York, the 52-year-old chair of the Democratic caucus, appears almost certain to win the minority leader position in the Democratic leadership elections scheduled for Nov. 30, becoming the first Black man to lead a party in Congress. The first woman Speaker, in passing the torch, will make history once again. Pelosi intends to spend the next two years in valedictory mode. \u201cMy life ahead is full of thank-yous,\u201d she says, to her constituents and all the others who have supported her over the years. She does not plan to serve on any committees and she does not want to serve as a sort of shadow speaker from the sidelines. \u201cThanksgiving is coming,\u201d she says. \u201cI have no intention of being the mother-in-law in the kitchen saying, \u2018My son doesn\u2019t like the stuffing that way, this is the way we make it in our family.\u2019 They will have their vision. They will have their plan. It\u2019s up to the caucus to decide which way they want to go.\u201d",

    "content": "The post How are Bitcoin Long-Term Holders Responding to the BTC Price Crash? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The Bitcoin price has continued to shrink in 2022 since Terra Luna initiated a significant crypto crash in Q1. The FTX and Alameda meltdown has stirred fresh selling pressure, which analysts expect to push through 2023. Moreover, confidence in centralized crypto exchanges has significantly slumped, which may push some to the insolvency route. According to our latest crypto price oracles, Bitcoin is trading around $16,500, up from the recent lows of $15,900. The digital asset is trading 76 percent down from its ATH, $69k, set approximately a year ago. Long-term Bitcoin critic Peter Schiff thinks Bitcoin price is yet to bottom per the current sentiments. Shiff highlighted a scenario where long-term Bitcoin holders sell their bags to sustain themselves\u2014adding that sooner than later, only long-term holders with sustainable paychecks will survive the shakeout. It didn't take long for this forecast to come true. The lion's share of the selling has not even started yet. #Bitcoin still has a long way to fall. https://t.co/dvNtGMIQHq\u2014 Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) November 17, 2022 Nonetheless, long-term Bitcoin holders are optimistic about the overall Btc market, which has significant adoption worldwide. Per on-chain data, long-term Bitcoin holders perceive the current bear market as similar to 2018 one. Glassnode explained: \u201cBitcoin Long-Term Holders are currently experiencing acute financial stress, holding an average of -33% in unrealized losses. This is comparable to the lows of the 2018 bear market, which saw a peak unrealized loss of -36% on average.\u201d Notably, Glassnode data shows that crypto exchanges recorded a sharp uptick in withdrawals toward non-custodial platforms. Reportedly, cryptocurrency exchanges have seen one of the most significant net declines in aggregate BTC balance in history, falling by 72.9k BTC in 7 days. Glassnode Further Notes on Bitcoin Market Outlook Bitcoin (BTC) is a legal tender to two countries -El Salvador and the African Central Republic \u2013 and is regulated as a digital asset in many other jurisdictions. With a hard cap of 21 million Bitcoins and a halving to reduce the overall supply over time, market strategists are optimistic about its long-term success.\u00a0 Nevertheless, global geopolitics and the prevailing macroeconomics continue to push Bitcoin prices to higher volatility. For instance, the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine has significantly divided international regulators on using Bitcoin and other crypto assets.\u00a0 Furthermore, western governments argue that Russia has used Bitcoin and other crypto assets to manoeuvre the set sanctions.\u00a0 However, with the rising global inflation rate, which has significantly reduced fiat currencies\u2019 purchasing power, Bitcoin and other digital assets are expected to record significant cash inflows.",

    "content": "The post Toon Finance DogeCoin Shiba Inu Coin Moon After Elon Musk Seals Twitter Purchase appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News In the past few months, there has been a great deal of discussion over so-called \u201cmeme coins\u201d like DOGE, of which Elon Musk claims to be a large admirer. Since his controversial purchase of Twitter, it has rocketed in popularity. What is a meme coin? A cryptocurrency that is based on or gets its inspiration from an online meme is called a meme coin. The most well-known example of a currency based on a meme is the DOGE, which was designed after the viral image of a Shiba Inu dog known as the \u201cDoge\u201d meme. Other examples of meme coins are UBQ and COIN, both of which are based on popular memes such as \u201cUbiquiti\u201d and \u201cBitcoin,\u201d respectively. The realm of virtual currencies is perpetually undergoing change, with new concepts and technology being presented on a consistent basis. The proliferation of meme coins is a relatively recent phenomenon in this sector.\u00a0 The Support of DOGEcoin by Elon Musk and What It Means for Investors in Cryptocurrencies Elon Musk, CEO of both Tesla and SpaceX, has been a prominent booster of DOGEcoin, which has led to a significant increase in the price of the cryptocurrency. It is possible that there is more to Musk\u2019s backing than meets the eye, despite the fact that some people assume he is just trying to capitalise on the current wave of excitement. In this article, we will discuss some of the reasons that Musk may have endorsed DOGEcoin, as well as what this support may represent for those who have invested in cryptocurrencies. There are a few different hypotheses to consider on the reasons why Elon Musk is such a vocal supporter of DOGEcoin. To begin, it is possible that he just really likes the coin, or that he has faith in its potential in the long run. Second, it is possible that he is trying to raise people\u2019s knowledge about cryptocurrencies in general and the potential that they have as an investment. The third possibility is that he is attempting to create a buzz in order to artificially inflate the price of DOGEcoin (and make a profit in the process). It is important to note that Musk is not the only celebrity to endorse DOGEcoin; other celebrities, such as Snoop Dogg and Gene Simmons, have also shown their support for the cryptocurrency. It is possible that the price of DOGEcoin is being driven even higher by the increased attention it is receiving from high-profile personalities. It is impossible to overlook Elon Musk\u2019s impact on the cryptocurrency market, regardless of whether you are an investor in cryptocurrencies or just someone who is inquisitive about the world of digital currencies. The price of the cryptocurrency has skyrocketed as a direct result of his public promotion of DOGEcoin.\u00a0 Some people assume that he is simply trying to capitalise on the buzz around the cryptocurrency; however, there may be more to his endorsement than meets the eye. The impact that Musk\u2019s continuous support will have on DOGEcoin and the cryptocurrency industry as a whole is something that can only be determined with the passage of time; nevertheless, one thing is certain: he is most certainly someone to keep an eye on. Toon Finance Decnetalized coins are beginning to attract media attention from all over the world as more and more celebrities from across the world enter the field of decentralised finance. Toon Finance is a brand new DEX platform that operates similarly to pancake swaps and will include support for the ERC20 blockchain. Toon Finance is a forward-thinking piece of software that has produced a sizable community of seasoned users, and anyone who is interested in joining the team can do so at no cost. Simply joining their Telegram channel and introducing yourself is all that is required of you at this point. Already having raised more than 2 million dollars in USD during the first week of their presale, Toon Finance is poised to become the Meme token of the year. After many months of planning and preparation, the long-delayed project can now be accessed by the general public. The following is a list of the distinguishing characteristics that set Toon Finance apart from other meme coins, such as Tamadoge and Shiba Inu: Uses the DEX Operating System as its base. The primary feature of the Toon Finance Protocol is that it is a decentralized exchange (DEX) platform. This is a unique characteristic because other meme coins on the market operate on centralized platforms. Toon Finance operates on the DEX to offer investors more security and peace of mind. One of the biggest advantages of the DEX system is that it does not have a central failure point that hackers can attack to harm the users. This is why investors can rest assured that their finances are safer. Another advantage of DEX is that it eliminates the need for a third party to act as a middleman in the transactions.

    "content": "ConsenSys, in collaboration with several crypto companies, is co-launching a climate platform for the world built on the Ethereum PoS consensus protocol. Regulatory authorities have constantly expressed their worries over the effects of crypto mining on the environment. The Ethereum-based software firm, ConsenSys, which played a crucial role in the completion of the much-publicized Merge, has teamed up with many other crypto firms to co-launch the Ethereum Climate Platform (ECP) during the ongoing global climate conference, dubbed COP27. The COP27 is a United Nations Climate Change Global Innovation Hub in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, from November 6\u201318. The climate platform is developed for the Ethereum network and aims to reduce the ecosystem\u2019s excess energy demand, which was the norm before the Merge two months ago. According to Joseph Lubin, co-founder of ConsenSys and a developer of the Ethereum blockchain, the motive is to raise some capital and invest it in high-impact technologies. Lubin stated that the team is expected to find funding for new projects that have technological significance and determine how impactful they will become. Upon the completion of the Merge, Ethereum discontinued its use of the energy-intensive proof-of-work (PoW) to the more energy-efficient proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus protocol. Ethereum, during the PoW stage, was powered by miners who completed several challenging puzzles to add more transactions to the ledger. With the PoS, Ethereum utilizes validators to facilitate transactions on the blockchain while using less energy. After the Merge, the network has drastically reduced its energy use by 99.9%. Part of Lubin\u2019s statement read: \u201cThe Ethereum Merge has raised the bar for reducing climate change across the broader sectors of the global economy. It shows that with a collective drive, technological innovations are possible without increasing carbon emissions.\u201d Rising Concerns about Crypto Mining Even before Ethereum\u2019s transition from the PoW to the PoS, digital asset mining has been the subject of increasing backlash from regulators and environmental activists. Accordingly, the European Commission revealed in October that it plans to ban crypto mining if the region faces a severe energy crisis in the coming winter. As expected, regulatory agencies like the European Union (EU) are proposing ways to reduce PoW activities within the bloc. In October, the European Commission told its member states to be ready to stop crypto mining. In addition, the commission proposes load shedding in the region\u2019s electricity supply as winter approaches. China has since taken a more extreme stance by banning Bitcoin mining and other crypto trading activities in 2021. Other PoW protocols, like Dogecoin and Zcash, also consider switching to PoS due to energy concerns. Ethereum has experienced a significant surge in its price after the Merge, with the network seeing close to a 10% increase. However, the gains were short-lived as ETH could not continue its upward trend 24 hours after the historic transition. ETH currently trades at $1,214 at the time of writing, per our data. However, the token is yet to respond to the latest development as the community hopes for a price increase towards the $2,000 level before the year ends.

    "description": "<p>The United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has publicly censured Mohammad Prodhan, the former Chief Executive Officer of Sonali Bank UK (SBUK), for failing to establish and maintain effective anti-money laundering (AML) systems and controls at the bank. </p><p>The financial markets regulator, which <a href=\"https://www.financemagnates.com/institutional-forex/regulation/sonali-bank-uk-ceo-fined-76400-for-money-laundering/\">fined Prodhan \u00a376,400 in 2018</a>, is now opting to several disapprove the ex-CEO as a result of \u201cexceptional circumstances in this case.\u201d</p><p>These situations include \"Mr Prodhan returning to Bangladesh and no longer having income or assets in the UK; the fact he is no longer in employment in Bangladesh; ongoing personal conditions which limit his ability to travel to the UK for the Upper Tribunal; and the length of time since his misconduct which has been impacted by Covid-delays to the litigation,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.financemagnates.com/tag/financial-conduct-authority/\" target=\"_blank\">FCA</a> explained in a statement <a href=\"https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/fca-issues-final-notice-former-ceo-anti-money-laundering-failings\">released</a> on Friday.</p><p>Furthermore, the financial watchdog noted the Bank of England\u2019s Prudential Regulation Authority has canceled the bank\u2019s authorization. The institution has also been renamed to Sonali Bangladesh (UK) Limited, it said. </p><p>SBUK was founded in 2001 to serve the Bangladeshi community in the United Kingdom. The bank is the product of a partnership between the Bangladesh government and Sonali Bank, a state-owned commercial bank in Bangladesh.</p><p>Prodhan's Offence</p><p>In 2018, the FCA penalized Prodhan for failing to take charge of his AML duties at the SBUK, leading to \u201csystemic failures in SBUK\u2019s AML systems and controls throughout the business.\u201d However, the CEO referred the case to the Upper Tribunal, a UK superior appellate court, where the case was delayed. </p><p>\u201cWhile a financial penalty was appropriate in this case, prolonged litigation to enforce a penalty that is unlikely to be paid against a person who may not be able to travel to the UK to explain himself in person to the Upper Tribunal is neither practical nor fair,\" noted Mark Steward, Executive Director of Enforcement and Market Oversight at the FCA. \"In these exceptional circumstances, a public censure is an appropriate resolution of the case,\u201d Steward added.</p><p>Meanwhile, in 2016, <a href=\"https://www.financemagnates.com/tag/bangladesh/\">Bangladesh</a> appointed Pradhan as the Managing Director of Rupali Bank, a state-owned commercial bank. In 2019, the executive was also selected as the MD of Sonali Bank in Bangladesh. However, FCA in the latest statement said Prodhan is no longer in employment in Bangladesh.</p> This article was written by Solomon Oladipupo at www.financemagnates.com.",

    "content": "Dennis Rodman is one of the raunchiest men in NBA history, but even his experiences didn\u2019t work all the time. Especially not the nights before NBA games. The Bulls legend made a name in the NBA for various reasons. He was notably known as the rebounding king of his time. It\u2019s why he earned the nickname, \u2018The Worm.\u2019 His tough brand of defense and hustle stemmed from his time with the Detroit Pistons, known as the \u2018Bad Boy Pistons.\u2019 He helped the Bulls win three straight championships from 1995 to 1998 after Jordan recruited him. Jordan regularly played the Pistons during their peak, so he knew exactly what he would be getting with Rodman on the team. The Pistons routinely harassed Jordan to the point where they coined the \u2018Jordan rules\u2019, a physical style of play meant to neutralize the greatest player in NBA history. \u201cThe Last Dance\u201d turned to Dennis Rodman, the \u201cBad Boys\u201d Pistons of the late 1980s, the Jordan Rules and the continued turbulence early in the 1997-98 Bulls\u2019 campaign.https://t.co/TJcC04CAYr \u2014 Sun-Times Sports (@suntimes_sports) April 27, 2020 Also Read: \u201cLeBron James just mocked his own LeLiar personality\u201d: Lakers star makes fun of his pathological lying while discussing LeRoy Butler\u2019s Lambeau Leap Dennis Rodman discussed how scandalous experiments before games never worked for him Rodman\u2019s career is defined more by his adventures outside the court than those on it, however. He was a wild man. Rodman loved partying, and he loved to have fun with women. However, for all his crazy stories, Rodman found his breaking point. Even the legendary Rodman had his limits. It was surprising for him, but in the end, he did come to a decision. He was talking to Mike Tyson on his show \u2018Hotboxin\u2019, when he said, \u201cI\u2019ve done this twice in my life playing sports and I never knew that this s**t will f**k with you when you\u2019re playing the game.\u201d What exactly was he referring to? \u201cI\u2019m trying to have s*x all night before the game. Doesn\u2019t f****ng work out too well.\u201d The routine affected his gameplay and his coach even had to talk to him to sort out the issues. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you take a night off? I know what you did last night. You got weak knees right?\u201d Rodman recalled his coach saying. Rodman married himself and earned a cool $10 million Dennis Rodman is a generally wild character, but there are some lengths he\u2019ll go to that will amaze people. Once he even married himself, and the entire stunt netted him a massive profit. Dennis Rodman has a net worth of $500,000 right now, and he once tried to increase that immensely. In 1996, Rodman appeared at his book signing for \u2018Bad as I wanna be\u2019 in a bridal gown and a horse-drawn carriage. The whole thing was done to promote his book, and it worked. The book was a bestseller for several months, and in the end Rodman revealed that he earned $10 million from the entire thing. What a way to earn money, but of course, it\u2019s only Rodman who could do something like this.

    "content": "The post Top 5 Altcoins Which May Undergo a 10x Rally in 2023! appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin price appears to be in hot waters right now as it has lost a significant amount of investor base and also the trust. The resulting volatility has compelled the investors to move out of the platform, which has caused a significant financial loss in recent times. Hence, market participants are now hunting for potential altcoins that may undergo a 10x rally. Below mentioned are the potential altcoins for 2023: Ethereum Ethereum is the second largest asset after Bitcoin, sharing a significant market cap with the crypto space. With the launch of ETH 2.0, the asset displayed enough strength to remain above the crucial support zones in times of bear markets. However, the current market conditions have driven the ETH price down, but with a slight change in the bearish market sentiments, the price may rebound nicely to revive the bullish trend. XRP XRP price had begun to gain traction within the market as the analysts and the influencers believed the crypto\u2019s victory against the SEC could be imminent. Moreover, the asset\u2019s value has been extensively bearish or stagnant for a prolonged period and hence is believed to rebound well when the lawsuit settles down. Therefore, the year 2023 could bring decent returns for the asset that may trigger many other cryptos. Binance Coin Binance Coin is the third largest cryptocurrency after Bitcoin & Ethereum, excluding stablecoins, which have maintained a decent rally from the beginning. The asset rose to new heights without any noise and currently manifests huge strength. Therefore, the BNB price is assumed to rise significantly in the coming days and lay down a firm upswing since the beginning of 2023. Dogecoin Dogecoin, despite losing a huge user base due to the unfamous market crash in 2021, maintained its dominance. Hence is trading within the top 10 cryptos according to the market capitalization. The asset is believed to rebound finely as the market conditions stabalize and quickly reclaim the lost levels. In 2023, the DOGE price is expected to maintain a significant upswing and rise higher. Polygon Polygon\u2019s price has been incremental despite the bearish market sentiments and displays enough strength. The price presently appears to be strong and may resume with a firm upswing in the coming days. Once the MATIC price settles above $1, it may be easy for the asset to maintain a notable upswing in the coming days.",

    "content": "The post Big Eyes Coin Falls Short Toon Finance Slaughters ICO Presale Stage One 2.75 MIL appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News ICO Presale Fun Toonie Takeover It has been an extremely busy year in the world of cryptocurrency. Over 300 million people now trade cryptocurrencies while daily transactions now easily surpass the $100bn mark. Unsurprisingly, a glut of new digital tokens has entered the market, taking the total number of unique cryptocurrencies to over 20,000 and counting in 2022. However, some perform better than others. While investors in any environment would gladly take a slice of good fortune, the digital assets that perform well are not determined by luck alone. Far from it. Right now, Big Eyes Coin is at real risk of being one of the year\u2019s big losers while Toon Finance has emerged as one of the top assets to hold in 2023. Here\u2019s why. Big Eyes Coin falls short Toon Finance leads With its cute kitty-based token, Big Eyes launched its pre-sale phase with high hopes of matching the success of DogeCoin and other popular meme coins but with almost instant results at launch. While the platform has yet to officially launch its BIG coin, signs of potential shortcomings have already emerged. At a glance, Big Eyes is doing fine. With 3589.74 BIG tokens equating to $1, the company has successfully raised over $9.7m of its $10,700,000.00 presale ICO target. Meanwhile, the token can be purchased through USD payments or popular digital currencies like ETH and BNB. Confirmation that it will be available on Uniswap is another positive development. Big Eyes is a DeFi economy that is powered by the Ethereum blockchain and delivers safe, fast, and decentralized transactions in an accessible, user-friendly, and innovative fashion. On the act of things, the opportunity to embrace a cute meme coin from launch stands out as an ideal introduction to crypto investments for new investors as well as a low-risk portfolio booster for experienced investors. However, when you scratch beneath the surface, Big Eyes Coin has already underperformed by failing to sell out its pre-sale allocation while even its $250 competition has yet to transform the fortunes of the token.\u00a0 Big Eyes has brought some intrigue to the industry while the fluffy, cartoon images are equally as impressive as those used by the dog-related meme coins. However, a difficult year for DOGE and Shiba Inu \u2013 which has fallen from $0.000079 in late October 2021 to under $0.00001 \u2013 will undoubtedly cause concern regarding the long-term prospects of any meme coin. The market is recovering from the crash but global economic difficulties will inevitably cause hesitation from investors when it comes to acting purely on speculation. In a world where information is available at our fingertips, people rightly want to scrutinize investments to validate their choices. Furthermore, many analysts predict that a repeat of those exponential bull runs of 2021 simply cannot be repeated by coins that rely on novelty alone.\u00a0 Ultimately, the potential of Big Eyes to spark some interest is clear, but the big question is \u201cthen what?\u201d. The answer is, sadly, \u201cnothing\u201d. Aside from the fact that investments will contribute to the platform\u2019s 5% charity donation, the BIG token is just a fun digital asset with no real purpose. There lies the problem. Toon Finance is set to combine novelty with function The ability of meme coins to attract investors and take crypto into the public consciousness has been a driving force in the new era of cryptocurrency investments. While the ship for novelty alone may have passed \u2013 especially when looking at the forecasts for BIG before it has even launched \u2013 it has shown the demand for accessibility as the appeal of investments continues to expand beyond blockchain supporters to a wide range of demographics. Another upcoming token currency in its pre-sale phase is Toon Finance. And by combining the novelty aspects with genuine long-term function, it looks set to enjoy a phenomenal 2023 with many analysts forecasting a major bull run shortly after its official launch on January, 1. Having only launched its pre-sale phase in the second week of October, Toon Finance has sold an impressive $2.75m worth of its native TFI coin. Moreover, its ICO has been included on CoinMarketCap, Crypto.com, and KuCoin. Interest in the digital token is further highlighted by the fact that it has become the most searched-for asset on CoinMarketCap. The fun cartoon mascots certainly capture the attention but the early success and long-term prospects of Toon Fi is primarily attributed to its function within the context of the Toon Finance metaverse. The P2E platform is geared towards gamers with the Space Battle Grounds arena allowing players to compete against other members of the growing community through a range of games. Lotteries and other fun initiatives ensure that the digital space will be a truly immersive experience for members. Toon Finance is technically a meme coin as it was named after a meme. However, the platform has a serious application and is about far more than its native token, but its success will surely open the door to significant growth. Having already outperformed Big Cat and TAMAdodge, which also had a positive start before losing some momentum, TFI is the hottest token due for an imminent release. New digital assets are the way to go in 2023 After a difficult 2022 for the crypto industry \u2013 as well as real-world investments \u2013 2023 promises to be far more pleasing. Embracing ICOs and early launch investments could signal the perfect opportunity for investors to reach their short and long-term financial objectives. Not least because there is a chance to build a diverse portfolio thanks to the low purchase prices involved.\u00a0 The landscape is changing as the top new digital tokens will combine the best features of meme coins with those of utility coins to provide genuine function. Whether ToonFi or other new tokens can emulate the boom of 2021 remains to be seen, but it is clear that there is a potential for huge ROIs. After seeing how quickly things can change, though, early investments will be the key to maximized returns. Once a prime candidate has been found, now is the time to join the party. The ICO Presale \u2013 What is it and should you participate? An ICO presale is a period of time before the main ICO event when a project sells tokens to strategic investors at a discounted price. This is usually done in order to raise funds to finance the main ICO event. If you\u2019re thinking of participating in an ICO presale, there are a few things you should know. In this blog post, we\u2019ll cover what an ICO presale is, how it works, and whether or not you should participate in one.\u00a0 What is an ICO Presale?\u00a0 An ICO presale (also sometimes called a private sale or pre-ICO) is a period of time before the main ICO event when a project sells tokens to strategic investors at a discounted price. This is usually done in order to raise funds to finance the main ICO event.\u00a0 During an ICO presale, a project will offer tokens at a significantly lower price than they will during the main ICO event. For example, if the main ICO event price for 1 token is $1, the project might offer tokens during the presale at $0.50 each. The aim of this is to attract larger investors who are willing to commit more money upfront in exchange for a discount.\u00a0 It\u2019s important to note that not all projects hold an ICO presale \u2013 some only have a main ICO event. And not all projects that do have an ICO presale make it open to the public. In some cases, the presale may be invitation-only and only available to accredited investors.\u00a0 How Does an ICO Presale Work?\u00a0 If you\u2019re interested in participating in an ICO presale, there are usually two ways you can go about it. The first is through an exchange and the second is directly through the project\u2019s website.\u00a0 If you choose to participate through an exchange, you\u2019ll need to create an account and deposit funds into it. Once you\u2019ve done that, you\u2019ll be able to buy tokens during the ICO presale at the specified price.\u00a0 Should You Participate in anICO Presale? Whether or not you should participate in anICO presale depends on a few factors. Firstly, do your research on the project and make sure you believe in its long-term viability. Secondly, consider whether or not you\u2019re comfortable with taking on more risk \u2013 remember that as with any investment, there\u2019s always a chance you could lose your money entirely. And finally, make sure you understand how much money you\u2019re willing to invest and stick to that budget \u2013 don\u2019t get caught up in FOMO (fear of missing out) and end up investing more than you can afford to lose!\u00a0 Toon Finance / TFT Twitter / Toon Finance Telegram Disclaimer: This is a press release post.

    "content": "The post Bitcoin (BTC) Price Stuck in Rut: Here\u2019s What Traders Can Expect This Weekend appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The bankruptcy filing by the crypto exchange giant FTX has created a black hole in the crypto space as the market has lost billions of dollars due to the FTX crash. However, it may mark the birth of a fresh bullish start for the crypto market by Q1 of 2023 as it sets a new goal for leading assets to bounce back to unexpected price levels. As the macro conditions of the traditional market improve, Bitcoin tends to fade its bottom levels by skyrocketing to a bullish territory.\u00a0 Bitcoin To Ignore Its Consolidated Zone Soon! The crypto sector, which once promised the community and investors decentralization and trust, now has turned out to be a joke, ending up with authoritarianism after FTX\u2019s demise. However, Bitcoin seems to continue its legacy and lead the market to the North as it aims to initiate an upward rally by next week. Trading View A well-known crypto analyst, Matthew Dixon, the CEO of Evai, predicts that Bitcoin may extend its current consolidation trend for the next few days. According to him, Bitcoin may break its ongoing consolidated price range if it exceeds the price level of $17K. He further predicts that BTC may form an upward triangle pattern in the price chart with two tops between the price range of $17.6K and $17.4K. Bitcoin may project itself with a smooth run to $19.5K if it surpasses its resistance at $17.6K by the next week. What Lies Ahead For Bitcoin? The FTX\u2019s downfall is similar to previous bearish events like Mt Gox in 2014, and it may raise concerns about centralization and centralized exchanges. Hence, Bitcoin has a high chance of standing out as it works in a decentralized nature, forcing users to trust self-custodian wallets rather than centralized exchanges. Looking at the daily price chart, the Bitcoin market has reached a short-term consolidation range as the BTC price has been hovering around the $16K-$17K range from the last week. Bitcoin currently trades at $16.5K after it faced rejection again at $17K today.\u00a0 The RSI-14 indicator has no sign of improvement as it continues to trend in an overselling zone of the 36-level. However, the MACD line seems to change its mood as it starts trading parallelly with the current trend without dropping further below its signal line. Bitcoin price is currently building a short-term momentum which may test an immediate support level at $16,350. If BTC fails to hold its price near $16K, it can soon aim for a breakout below its 23.6% Fib retracement, plunging hard to $14.5K. However, an upward retracement is expected if BTC makes a bullish reversal after testing the $16,350 support level. A breakout above its Bollinger band\u2019s upper limit, which is near the EMA-20 trend line at $17.9K, may spark fresh surges in the price chart, and Bitcoin can next make an attempt to break its strong resistance at $20K.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0",

    "description": "The decision to freeze Shin\u2019s asset worth over $104 million was approved by the Seoul Southern District Court, which was based on a request from the prosecutors.",
    "content": "While crypto exchange FTX stole the limelight from other fallen ecosystems, South Korean authorities continue their efforts to bring closure to the victims of the year\u2019s first crypto crash \u2014 Terraform Labs. Nearly six months after the Terra (LUNA) blockchain was officially halted , South Korean authorities froze approximately $104.4 million (140 billion won) from co-founder Shin Hyun-seong based on suspicion of unfair profits. The decision to freeze Shin\u2019s asset worth over $104 million was approved by the Seoul Southern District Court, which was based on a request from the prosecutors. The claim related to Shin\u2019s involvement in selling pre-issued Terra ( LUNA ) tokens to unwary investors. Based on suspicion of profiting from unwarranted LUNA sales, the district court froze the allegedly stolen funds until further investigations are underway, reported local news media YTN. \u201cReports that CEO Shin Hyun-seong sold Luna at a high point and realized profits or that he made profits through other illegal methods are not true,\u201d Cointelegraph previously quoted Shin\u2019s attorney . The preindictment preservation of the funds is a way of preventing bad actors from disposing of stolen funds and causing more financial damage or losses for the investors. Shin is currently being investigated by South Korean authorities on two charges \u2014 making unfair profits from issuing in-house tokens LUNA and TerraUSD (UST) and leaking customer transaction information of Chai \u2014 a Korean payment app linked to Terra \u2014 to Terraform Labs. On November 14, the South Korean prosecutors requested the accused co-founder appear in court as part of an investigation into the firm's collapse. Related: Terra Labs, Luna Guard commission audit to defend against allegations of misusing funds In the first week of November, the prosecutors accused Terra co-founder Do Kwon of manipulating Terra\u2019s price. \"It's highly disappointing to see the Korean prosecutors continue to try to contort the Capital Markets Act to fit their agenda and push baseless claims. Prior judicial decisions and statements by the Korean financial authorities, including the FSC, establish that cryptocurrency tokens are not investment contract securities,\" said Terraform Labs spokesperson in a written statement to Cointelegraph.",

Recently, the exchange was reportedly \u201chacked\u201d and more than $600 million in funds were squeezed out. Meanwhile, many believed it was the job of an insider as the stolen funds were quickly converted into Ethereum & stablecoins. In a fresh update, SBF has reportedly received a portion of $420 million in funds into his personal account. FTX raised $420 million in funding in October last year to improve the user experience and be more in line with regulators. Interestingly, nearly 75% of the total amount was sent to SBF. The October 2021 funding round valued FTX exchange at $25 billion and raised money from investors like BlackRock, Tiger Global, and Singapore\u2019s sovereign wealth fund Temasek & Sequoia Capital. Later, after a couple of months, some of these investors helped raise $400 million for FTX\u2019s subsidiary at an $8 billion valuation. During the time funds were raised, the crypto markets were booming and the Alameda was highly profitable. While it is still unclear what SBF did with the $300 million, whether it was poured back to FTX or kept separate, Meanwhile, FTX\u2019s 2021 audited financial statements said the money was being reserved by the company for \u2018operational expediency\u2019 on behalf of the related party.",

On November 11, the platform filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.

Sullivan & Cromwell, a Wall Street law firm, has been hired by FTX as outside legal assistance in bankruptcy proceedings and criminal investigations.\u00a0 The exchange contacted the legal firm as its liquidity problem grew \u201cincreasingly grave,\u201d according to court documents. According to FTX and its extensive network of affiliated businesses, which includes trading firm Alameda Research, its assets and liabilities are between $10 billion and $50 billion.\u00a0 Bankman-Fried\u2019s assets, which were previously valued at $16 billion, have been destroyed.\u00a0 A class action lawsuit against Bankman-Fried and numerous famous exchange promoters was also filed on Thursday, accusing them of engaging in fraud against \u201cunsophisticated investors.\u201d\u00a0 On behalf of investors, the Moskowitz Law Firm and Boies Schiller filed a case alleging that Bankman-Fried violated U.S. securities laws and caused approximately $11 billion in damages.

    "description": "Amid its ongoing battle with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Ripple has announced that it is seeking to expand its presence in the European Union (EU). In an interview with CNBC earlier this week, Stuart Alderoty, General Counsel for Ripple, said that \u201ceffectively, Ripple is operating outside of the U.S.\u201d as it stands due to its ongoing legal woes with the SEC. He added: Essentially, its customers and its revenue are all driven outside of the U.S., even though we still have a lot of employees inside of the U.S. Whilst it patiently awaits the outcome of its lawsuit, Ripple is planning to expand its presence in Europe. The firm already has two employees working on the ground in the Republic of Ireland and is seeking a virtual asset service provider (VASP) license from the Irish Central Bank so that it can \u201cpassport\u201d its offerings throughout the EU via an entity based there. The company also plans to file an application for an electronic money license in the country \u201cshortly.\u201d Alderoty said that he expects a ruling on the case against Ripple which has been going on since 2020 very soon, adding that \u201cwe are at the beginning of the end of the process in our case.\u201d. The SEC filed a lawsuit against the company alleging that the firm and its executives illegally sold XRP tokens, a cryptocurrency created in 2012 by the firm\u2019s founders, to investors without first registering the token as a security. The company denies claims that XRP is a security, arguing that the token should not be considered an investment contract and is used in its business to facilitate cross-border transactions between banks and financial institutions. Ripple Plans to Expand in Anticipation of MiCA Ripple\u2019s plans to expand into the EU are driven by anticipation of the zone\u2019s Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulations coming into effect within a few years. The regulatory framework was passed by EU lawmakers earlier in the year and seeks to align rules regarding crypto assets across the region. Beyond the EU, Ripple has also made the United Kingdom a priority by releasing a white paper with a set of guidelines outlining how it thinks Britain should regulate cryptocurrencies.

    "description": "FIFA president Gianni Infantino lashed out at Western critics of the Qatar World Cup\u2014sparking more controversy on the eve of the event",
    "content": "On the eve of signature sporting events, athletic administrators often address the media, as a sort of \u201cstate-of-the-union\u201d affair to address a league\u2019s accomplishments and concerns. Before the Super Bowl and NBA Finals, for example, commissioners of the NFL and NBA speak to the press, take some questions from reporters, and either offer direct answers or spin as they see fit. It\u2019s an almost ceremonial exercise. The goal: mollify the media before everyone moves onto the big games. On Saturday in Doha, FIFA president Gianni Infantino offered a new twist on this ritual. Instead of ushering in the Qatar World Cup, which begins on Sunday, Infantino gave an extraordinary speech, full of grievances about media examinations of the host country\u2019s human rights record, whataboutism, and what can best be described as an awkward attempt to compare his personal backstory to disenfranchised populations across the globe. (At worst, his remarks were highly offensive). [time-brightcove not-tgx=\u201dtrue\u201d] Infantino badly conflated examination with provocation. CNN labeled the speech an \u201cexplosive tirade.\u201d If anything, the immediate negative response to Infantino\u2019s press conference shined further light on the problems surrounding this 2022 World Cup, and undercut his own plea to keep the focus on football, to stick to sports. Infantino scored a spectacular own-goal for his own World Cup. Near the beginning of his sprawling hour-long address, Infantino said, \u201cToday I feel Qatari. Today I feel Arabic. Today I feel African. Today I feel gay. Today I feel disabled. Today I feel (like) a migrant worker. \u201cOf course I am not Qatari, I am not an Arab, I am not African, I am not gay, I am not disabled. But I feel like it, because I know what it means to be discriminated, to be bullied, as a foreigner in a foreign country. As a child I was bullied \u2013 because I had red hair and freckles, plus I was Italian so imagine.\u201d Infantino grew up in Switzerland. He said he feels like a migrant worker. Infantino made a $3.2 million in 2019. \u201cWhat do you do then?\u201d Infantino said. \u201cYou try to engage, make friends. Don\u2019t start accusing, fighting, insulting, you start engaging. And this is what we should be doing.\u201d (READ MORE: Meet The 22-Year-Old Star Who Could Make Team USA A World Cup Contender) Summoning the familiar whatabout deflection to which we\u2019ve become all too accustomed in political discourse, Infantino suggested that Western countries were in no position to criticize Qatar, given the human rights shortcomings in Europe and elsewhere. \u201cWe have told many, many lessons from some Europeans, from the western world,\u201d Infantino said. \u201cI think for what we Europeans have been doing the last 3,000 years we should be apologizing for next 3,000 years before starting to give moral lessons to people.\u201d True, every nation is far from perfect. But Infantino seemed to forget that he leads an organization that was embroiled in a bribery scandal when it awarded the World Cup to Qatar in 2010. (Though Infantino was not head of FIFA at the time). That thousands of migrant workers have died in Qatar over the past decade, many because of poor working conditions made more perilous by excessive heat. That FIFA made a conscious decision to hold a World Cup in Qatar. Questions are more than fair game. For Infantino to suggest criticism of Qatar is \u201cjust hypocrisy\u201d could not be more hypocritical. Infantino also looked to the disabled population to make his case for media hypocrisy. \u201cI was at an event a few days ago when we explained what we\u2019re doing at this World Cup for disabled people,\u201d Infantino said. He noted that there were around 400 journalists at his press conference on Saturday, but just four at that event. \u2018There [are] one billion disabled people in the world,\u201d he said. \u201cOne billion disabled people. Nobody cares.\u201d Infantino summoned some self-pity for FIFA, an organization that has earned none. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy, everyday and everyday to read all these critics,\u201d he said. He also lectured the press on how they should do their job going forward. \u201cIf you need to criticize somebody, don\u2019t criticize the players,\u201d Infantino said. \u201cDon\u2019t put pressure on the players, don\u2019t put pressure on the coaches. Let them concentrate on making their fans happy.\u201d His words were met with swift condemnation. Nicholas McGeehan, director of FairSquare, a non-profit human rights organization, called Infantino\u2019s speech \u201ccrass.\u201d \u201cIn brushing aside legitimate human rights criticisms, Gianni Infantino is dismissing the enormous price paid by migrant workers to make his flagship tournament possible \u2013 as well as FIFA\u2019s responsibility for it,\u201d Steve Cockburn, Amnesty International\u2019s Head of Economic and Social Justice, said in a statement. \u201cDemands for equality, dignity and compensation cannot be treated as some sort of culture war \u2013 they are universal human rights that FIFA has committed to respect in its own statutes.\u201d Infantino did announce that FIFA would start a legacy fund to follow this World Cup. \u201cThis cannot be mere window dressing, however,\u201d said Cockburn. \u201cIf FIFA is to salvage anything from this tournament, it must announce that it will invest a significant part of the $6 billion the organization will make from this tournament and make sure this fund is used to compensate workers and their families directly.\u201d Let\u2019s hope Infantino\u2019s actions after the World Cup rank better than his performance before it.

    "content": "The post PancakeSwap Will List ORY In December \u2013 Is Oryen Listing On WazirX, Binance, Or KuCoin After Its Presale? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Many cryptocurrency projects have recently struggled to raise prices to more desirable levels. However, Oryen (ORY), a new cryptocurrency with an ongoing presale, is breaking the trend. The project has commenced phase four of the presale with new records of 120% returns for early investors. At this rate, Oryen might become one of the market\u2019s top cryptocurrencies once it lists on PancakeSwap, WazirX, Binance, and KuCoin, as rumored after the presale phase. Oryen (ORY) Oryen, the most intriguing cryptocurrency project on Binance Smart Chain, is currently in presale. Investing in this project allows token holders to get the most steady passive income. A fixed annual percentage yield (APY) of 90% is offered by Oryen, which is higher than the APYs of other staking protocols and remains constant regardless of market conditions. Oryen aims to automate and simplify staking while providing its users with high yields. Thus, it uses the Oryen Autostaking Technic (OAT), which enables immediate and secure auto-staking. Holders of ORY have nothing else to do than wait for their hourly rewards to land directly into their wallets. In addition, the project uses Risk-Free Value (RFV), a separate wallet that ensures the stability of the ORY price. It has a reserve to support and maintain constant reward payouts during challenging market periods. PancakeSwap PancakeSwap is one of the biggest decentralized exchanges and a household name on the Binance Smart Chain. It will be Oryen\u2019s first step to list on the DEX on the 30th of December before it potentially lists on any centralized exchange afterward. WazirX (WRX) WazirX is the largest and fastest-growing cryptocurrency exchange in India. Under the umbrella of Binance, it offers INR trading pairs for more than 200 crypto assets. Reportedly, Oryen\u2019s team is currently approaching the exchange in anticipation of its launch in late December. This move would open ORY to a vast market of more than 100 million Indian investors. The Bottom Line Oryen is surpassing investors\u2019 expectations with an astonishing 120% price increase since the presale started. Moreover, the rumored exchange listings might give the staking platform the powder it needs to enter the realm of the top 100 cryptocurrencies.

    "description": "Naomi Biden and Neal exchanged \u201cI do's\u201d during a nippy late-morning ceremony",
    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Joe Biden \u2018s granddaughter Naomi Biden and her fiance, Peter Neal, were married Saturday in just the 19th wedding in the history of the White House. Naomi Biden and Neal exchanged \u201cI do\u2019s\u201d during a nippy late-morning ceremony \u2014 temperatures were in the low 40s \u2014 on the South Lawn, which was turned into a wedding venue for the very first time. It\u2019s the first White House wedding with a president\u2019s granddaughter as the bride. Scores of white folding chairs dotted a portion of the South Lawn, and the South Portico of the White House, facing the lawn and the Washington Monument in the distance, was decorated with wreaths and garland bearing white flowers. There was no tent. Guests began arriving hours before the ceremony, with some women opting for open-toed shoes despite the chill. [time-brightcove not-tgx=\u201dtrue\u201d] The public is seeing none of the festivities, unlike some past White House weddings. The bride and groom decided to keep journalists out, although the ceremony was outdoors on the grounds of what the president and first lady call the \u201cpeople\u2019s house.\u201d Naomi Biden, 28, is a lawyer in Washington. Her parents are Hunter Biden, the son of the president and first lady Jill Biden, and Kathleen Buhle, Hunter\u2019s first wife. Neal, 25, of Jackson Hole, Wyoming, recently graduated from the University of Pennsylvania law school. He works at Georgetown University Law Center in Washington. His parents are Drs. Mary C. and William \u201cBill\u201d C. Neal of Jackson Hole. The couple, who have been living at the White House, was set up by a mutual friend about four years ago in New York City and have been together ever since, the White House said. Neal proposed in September 2021 near his childhood home in Jackson Hole with a ring that repurposed the band of his grandmother\u2019s engagement ring, according to the White House. After the 20-somethings officially became husband and wife, their families and the wedding party were getting out of the cold and heading back inside the White House for lunch, which is to be followed in the evening by a dessert-and-dancing reception, according to a person familiar with the planning who was not authorized to publicly discuss the wedding schedule. Few other details were released before the ceremony. To accommodate public interest, the president and first lady planned to issue a statement and release photos after the first of their six grandchildren tied the knot, the White House said. President Biden and the first lady were among those who attended the wedding rehearsal dinner Friday at the Renwick Gallery steps from the White House. Neal\u2019s parents hosted. The Biden family will pay for all wedding activities, White House officials have said. \u201cThe wedding of Naomi Biden and Peter is a private one,\u201d Karine Jean-Pierre, the president\u2019s chief spokesperson, said Friday. \u201cIt\u2019s a family event and Naomi and Peter have asked that their wedding be closed to the media and we are respecting their wishes.\u201d There have been 18 documented weddings in the 200-plus-year history of the White House. Nine involved a president\u2019s daughter, most recently Richard Nixon\u2019s daughter Tricia in 1971 and Lyndon Johnson\u2019s daughter Lynda in 1967. But nieces, a grandniece, a son and first ladies\u2019 siblings have also gotten married there. One president, Grover Cleveland, tied the knot at the White House, too, while in office. Some of the weddings were open to coverage by the news media, while others weren\u2019t at all. Journalists were allowed into Tricia Nixon\u2019s wedding to Ed Cox, the first wedding held in the Rose Garden. Her wedding planner \u2014 a three-ring black binder in the offices of the White House Historical Association \u2014 includes extensive notes on the media plan. But the May 1994 wedding of a brother of then-first lady Hillary Clinton and the daughter of then-U.S. Sen. Barbara Boxer \u2014 the first since Tricia Nixon\u2019s marriage \u2014 was closed to the press. Clinton\u2019s spokesperson commented afterward and the White House released a photo. It was the same for the October 2013 wedding of Pete Souza, President Barack Obama\u2019s official photographer, and his longtime partner, Patti Lease. The White House announced the wedding in a statement following the small, private wedding in the Rose Garden. The White House Correspondents Association, which advocates for press access to the White House and the president, said it was \u201cdeeply disappointed\u201d that the White House declined its request for press coverage of Naomi Biden\u2019s wedding. \u201cWhite House weddings have been covered by the press throughout history and the first family\u2019s wish for privacy must be balanced against the public\u2019s interest in an event occurring at the People\u2019s House with the president as a participant,\u201d the WHCA board said in a statement. Stewart McLaurin, president of the White House Historical Association, said it\u2019s important to remember that first families are families first and foremost. \u201cTheir privacy should be respected, their wishes should be respected,\u201d he said. The wedding is just one half of a big weekend for the Biden family. The president\u2019s 80th birthday is Sunday and family members in town will celebrate him at a brunch hosted by the first lady.",

The current Princess of Wales chatted with several families who had to flee their homeland following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. </p> <p>Body language expert Darren Stanton analyzed footage from Kate\u2019s visit and said she displayed several \u201csubmissive\u201d gestures which indicated that she had a genuine interest in being there and supporting the Ukrainian families. </p> <p>Speaking on behalf of <a href=\"http://www.slingo.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Slingo</a>, Stanton observed: \u201cWe saw Kate interacting with children by sitting at the table where they were coloring in leaning forward and lowering her height in a submissive gesture. It\u2019s designed to build rapport with children because when someone is at their height they\u2019re more inclined to think \u2018this is someone like me\u2019 as opposed to someone standing over them. </p> <p>\u201cShe also unconsciously raises her hand to a chin, this is what we call evaluation or analysis so it shows that she is deeply interested in what those she is interacting with are doing and saying, and also the fact she is authentic, it is not a contrived or deliberate action. The body language denotes she really wants to be there and she\u2019s happy.\u201d</p> <figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\"> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The inspirational work of the Reading Ukrainian Community Centre is non-stop, and it\u2019s changing lives!<br> <br>Providing practical advice on employment and housing, delivering educational classes for children and building social connections, the centre is at the heart of the community. <a href=\"https://t.co/tn1Vrk846L\">pic.twitter.com/tn1Vrk846L</a></p>\u2014 The Prince and Princess of Wales (@KensingtonRoyal) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KensingtonRoyal/status/1593250839401230337?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 17, 2022</a></blockquote><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script> </div></figure> <p>Stanton added: \u201cWhen she spoke to an older gentleman at the center, he had his hands behind his back in an authoritative gesture and she placed her hands in front of her.

The regrouping of the bulls at $0.022 will give them the advantage to reclaim their ground in the market. pressure in the early part of today\u2019s trading session, there were reactions on both the upper band and the lower band of the Bollinger indicator. This means bulls are still strong to drive the price upward. They are holding firmly to their new support price level. Now at around the latest trading sessions, we noticed the contraction of the upper and lower band of the indicator. This signals a bullish breakout as both the forces of demand and the forces of supply get evenly matched From this point of view, we can see that support level remains a strong brick wall. The bearish price continues to be rejected as several attempts were made to bring the price lower than this level. With such a strong support price level like this one, the price of TAMA is expected to have a strong bullish price breakout. The price is expected soon to hit $0.0024. Tamadoge has a fully transparent 10-year plan, and to achieve its goals, They have employed a seasoned development team to make sure they deliver on all its promises.",

    "content": "The went on a steep price dive on November 8 after the price hits $0.28. It was almost like a unanimous decision by traders to take profits at the height of that price level. In two days the price decline hits $0.15. This was the support price level from where the market price began to rebound. Now as the price of the market nears the $0.28 price level, the price was rejected and in today\u2019s market, the price goes the bullish way After a support level was secured at $0.15, the bull market faced rejection at $0.228. But because the force behind the trend is still strong, it resumed its upside journey until it came to $0.28. The bearish move in today\u2019s market has a strong outlook. But its progress remains pegged at around the $0.25 price level. If the demand force behind the market trend remains strong as we have noticed in the previous session, the trend may continue. Today\u2019s bearish market move is yet to cross the 20-day moving average. And the RSI line is yet to cross the signal line of the RSI indicator. Likewise in the MACD indicator, the MACD line is yet to cross the MACD signal line. There for, a bearish trend cannot be confirmed yet for the Chiliz market. We need to patiently wait to see the direction of the market in the next session. The day\u2019s trading session opens with the failure of the buying pressure to advance the price beyond the November 8 resistance price level. A massive bearish move took place in the second trading session. But since the third session, it looks like the buyers have successfully secured a new support level at around $0.25 price level. The momentum of the selling pressure is waning at this level. Likewise (and more than the bullish performance of Chiliz) a new token still in its presale shows the prospect of much upside price performance. The collapse of FTX brings about a need for a cutting-edge trading intelligence platform, and that exactly is what offers. It is a platform that can adequately detect impending adverse issues similar to what happened to FTX and thus enabling investors and traders to pinpoint safe opportunities for good profits. The D2T token presale is ongoing and it has raised $6.5million so far.",

    "content": "It has been that there has been a continuation in the SOL/USD market bulls\u2019 pushing weight weaknesses as the crypto coin falls near the $10 support line. The last several hours of trading have metamorphosed between $13.27 and $12.57, keeping a pace of minus 2.71 percentage rate as of the time of writing. Resistance levels: $20, $25, $30 Support levels: $10, $7.50, $5 The SOL/USD daily chart reveals the crypto market falls near the $10 support level in a range-bound style as the $20 resistance level is the upper range part. Two horizontal lines have to highlight the value lines where range motions are featured. The 14-day SMA indicator is $21.69, underneath the $30.89 value line of the 50-day SMA indicator. The Stochastic Oscillators have tightly conjoined to maintain a consolidation-moving posture in the oversold region at 13.95 and 14.15 levels, indicating there is a light myth that the former trading instrument will strive for a recovery soon. Prolongation of the market bulls\u2019 weaknesses may potentially degenerate into giving bears more strength in the range-bound spots to push down below the $10 support level as the price falls near it. At this point, a 1-hour chart will let long-position placers detect an early stage of spotting the possibility of price making a rebound before joining the move from a baseline afterward. In terms of investment talk, this time could be the best period to add to portfolio sizes. On the downside of the technical analysis, as it is, it appears not to be the time to join an ongoing declining force in the range-bound spots of $20 and $10 of the SOL/USD market operations. A chain of lower lows has formed toward the lower range line. It does possess an ideal technical window opportunity for getting decent entries. It may as be highly psychologically inclining to exit some of the sell orders that might have executed below the $40 point or around the $30. In comparison, has deepened into lower range-bound spots below the trend lines of the SMAs. The 14-day SMA indicator is underneath the trend line of the 50-day SMA indicator. The Stochastic Oscillators are consolidating their presences in the oversold region at 12.60 and 12.28 levels to indicate that the base crypto may still witness some debase-moving pattern against the counter-trading crypto for a while. A bullish candlestick that can emerge from a lower zone will be a notification sign toward getting upswings to invalidate the continuation of the bearish trend. For now, the collapse of FTX brings about a need for a cutting-edge trading intelligence platform, and that exactly is what Dash 2 Trade offers. It is a platform that can adequately detect impending adverse issues similar to what happened to FTX, thus enabling investors and traders to pinpoint safe opportunities for good profits.

    "content": "The year 2022 has been one of the most turbulent years for the global financial economy, including the crypto industry. With the crypto market already suffering the consequences of a severe bearish trend, things worsened further at the start of this year. As the world was recovering from the realities of the Covid industry, things worsened further with Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. All these factors significantly impacted Bitcoin\u2019s performance in the market. It is surprising considering Bitcoin attained its all-time high value exceeding the $60k mark in just November last year. Unfortunately, the fall of FTX also resulted in adverse consequences for the token bringing its value down to a two-year low in recent times. But will BTC exceed the $17k mark this weekend? Continue reading to find out. If you have been keeping up with the developments in the crypto industry, you must have attended to the news about FTX\u2019s collapse. The entire fiasco went on for a couple of weeks until recently, when FTX\u2019s Sam Fried-Bankman had to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. As you know, FTX was one of the leading crypto exchanges operating in the market at the start of this year. The CEO of the exchange had, in fact, earned himself the reputation for being the savior of the industry. He did so by acquiring many other crypto projects that were suffering due to the bearish performance of the market. The good times for FTX went on for quite some time until a new report from CoinDesk spilled out all the beans in front of the world. The report featured a leaked balance sheet from Alameda Research, FTX\u2019s trading company. The balance sheet brought forward many unanticipated truths that swept the crypto industry. The balance sheet highlighted that most of Alameda\u2019s assets were FTT tokens, the native currency of the FTX exchange. This meant trouble since the CEO was using this asset holding as collateral for funding many risky projects. Following this revelation, Binance came into the picture with an announcement that it shall be liquidating all its FTT holdings. This struck fear among investors and traders, given Binance is by far one of the largest investors in the exchange. Consequently, people went into a mode of panic and started withdrawing funds from the exchange and selling all their FTT holdings. However, FTX decided to close down its withdrawal processing, which only worsened things. But things looked like they would change for good after Binance announced its plans to acquire FTX. Unfortunately, even this deal fell apart as even Binance could not handle the mess FTX had in its books. Quite a few officials from Binance even went on to call FTX\u2019s books a black hole where one cannot make sense of almost anything. Following these developments, the FTX CEO, Sam Bankman Fried, filed for bankruptcy. Of course, Bitcoin is still the dominant player in the crypto market, and it has the potential to set trends in the crypto world. But that does not mean it is independent of all other developments in the industry. Following the collapse of FTX, almost every token in the market felt the heat, including Bitcoin. One of the primary rationales behind this is that people are now very reluctant in many ways and are somewhat wary about investing in cryptos. This evidently resulted in a huge drain of capital in the market, further deteriorating the overall aggravating situation. Hence, the collapse of FTX has had a direct or indirect impact on Bitcoin\u2019s value. The recent developments in the crypto industry have devastatingly impacted Bitcoin\u2019s overall valuation. Things went so bad so quickly that the token fell below the $18k mark after months and plunged into a new two-year low. However, as Bitcoin prices are picking up once again, things seem to change with each passing day. While the token has dabbled between low price ranges of $14k to 15k in the past couple of weeks, this week, Bitcoin reached over $16k after quite a long time. At the time of writing this, Bitcoin is priced at $16,665, and this has left many wondering if the token will break the $17k mark this weekend. There can be many factors fueling this rise, but the most important factor has something to do with the country of El Salvador. The president of the country, Nayib Bukele, recently announced they would be buying Bitcoins on a daily basis starting from the 17th of November. The country currently has 2,381 BTC worth a total investment of $39.4 million, down from $103 million due to recent developments. Following this, President Bukele declared the country would start buying more BTC every day starting from the 17th of November. This news came three months after the last BTC acquisition of the country. The stakeholders welcomed this move as it will put the demand and supply equation into play and change things for good. While Bitcoin started the day with a good announcement, the token\u2019s price has remained the same. The best one can do now is wait for the weekend to be over and see if the token can break the $17k mark. The crypto world is volatile, and stakeholders are well aware of the nature of the market. Thus, it is never always possible to predict the future of a token since anything can change at any given time. But that does not mean you should stop investing in this market and go home. Instead, you must learn lessons from these developments and use these situations to your advantage. The collapse of FTX highlights the significance of more intelligent trading platforms like that will help one find the right opportunities and make the most of them. Besides that, there is with its native token, $TARO, ideal for beating the next price rise with its new $100k milestone. Also, is nearing its $2 million mark, while is nearing the staggering $13 million benchmark. This shows that the crypto industry is not short of opportunities as long as you can find the right one.",

    "content": "American CryptoFed DAO, the first decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) to get legal recognition in the United States, is at risk of losing its registration after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) dug up anomalies in the Form S-1 registration statement dated Sept. 17, 2021. The Wyoming Secretary of State\u2019s office recognized American CryptoFed as a legal entity in July 2021 , at a time when the organization\u2019s CEO, Marian Orr, believed that \u201cWyoming is arguably the top blockchain jurisdiction in the world.\u201d However, on Nov. 18, 2022, the SEC instituted administrative proceedings against the DAO to determine the issuance of a stop order. A stop order from the SEC would retract American CryptoFed\u2019s registration and bar sales of in-house tokens, Ducat and Locke. According to the SEC\u2019s Division Of Enforcement, the Form S-1 registration statement filed by American CryptoFed lacks vital information, such as audited financial statements and details about its business and management. The SEC further believed that the American CryptoFed filing contains \u201cmisleading statements and omissions\u201d while being inconsistent in describing the tokens as securities. In this regard, David Hirsch, Chief of the Enforcement Division\u2019s Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit stated that: Hirsch clarified that issuers must provide the required disclosure information to the SEC. However, the SEC claimed non-cooperation from American CryptoFed during its examination of its registration statement. Based on the information made available to the public, Hirsch shared SEC intent regarding the DAO: Cointelegraph found that the official Telegram channel for the DAO has been disabled. However, the deletion of the Telegram account was not yet linked to the SEC\u2019s investigation at the time of writing. American CryptoFed has not yet responded to Cointelegraph\u2019s request for comment.

    "content": "Less than a couple of weeks back, crypto suffered a market-wide crash where most cryptocurrencies fell massively in price, many showing a decline of over 30%. Bitcoin, for example, slipped by close to $5.5k and is barely making a recovery. Amidst the market downfall, triggered by the FTX balance sheet concerns, there were a few coins that were able to pull themselves up. Although nowhere near their price before the drop, these coins have performed certainly well in the past 24 hours. Unlike the market leader Bitcoin which has shown almost no signs of recovery in the past week. To understand how the top crypto gainers have held firm for the past 24 hours, we must examine the tokens and the sentiment around them that dictated their price. Here are a few top gainers that display some optimism in the market, along with a few cryptocurrencies that turn out to be an ideal choice for investors, given the current market condition. is a decentralized blockchain network that supports a range of applications while being a self-sustaining, secure and efficient blockchain throughout. Launched in 2019, the blockchain operates on Proof of Stake and has a native token by the ticker symbol ALGO. Following the crash that commenced on Nov 8, the token dropped from $0.40 to $0.26 and touched a low of $0.24 on Nov 14. Since the low, the ALGO token has shown an upward trend and is currently trading at $0.30, gaining close to 6% in the last 24 hours. In May, FIFA announced its partnership with Algorand making it an official blockchain platform of FIFA. This news sent a wave of excitement among investors, and as the world cup is about to start on Nov 20, investors are anticipating a positive performance from the coin. While the crypto crash imposed selling pressure on investors, the belief that Algorand\u2019s association with reputable organizations will make it an appealing coin of choice in the long term has prevailed in the market. Owing to this, the coin continues to trace its path upwards, showing a decent increase in price in less than a day. If you\u2019re familiar with the term metaverse, there\u2019s very little chance that you haven\u2019t heard about Sandbox is among the top metaverses in crypto, or in general for that matter, and is fundamentally among the most solid crypto tokens in the market. It is a decentralized NFT metaverse, where users can purchase, create and sell their virtual reality NFTs, or buy a plot of land inside the metaverse. The project has a lot of big names associated with it, with one being the popular hip-hop artist Snoop Dogg. The primary reason the coin has managed to recover from its price drop is that it\u2019s been almost a couple of weeks since the crash took place, and the concerning sentiment across the crypto market is starting to fade off. Sandbox, being one of the best high-utility crypto projects, presents a great opportunity for new investors, more so because the token is now available at a discounted price. In addition to that, the price of the token is less than a dollar, making it highly accessible to all users. Given these characteristics, the project has attracted some attention in the last few days. Internet Computer offers a decentralized alternative to the current internet cloud providers, by allowing independent data centers to interact with each other. The platform allows users to create applications, websites and other web services. ICP has been cited as an \u201cavoidable\u201d crypto project when it comes to adding it to your portfolio, most because the token is down more than 99% since its launch, and has continued to trace a perpetual decline ever since. While the project has displayed a gain in the past 24 hours, mostly triggered by the daily cycle burn of its tokens- recorded to be the maximum this month. This in no way encourages investment in the project, given the long-term view isn\u2019t as bright as it may appear to be. If you\u2019re looking for cryptos that can offer exponential returns in the longer run, we have a few suggestions: It is clear from the FTX crash that there is a need for an advanced trading intelligence platform and is just the solution. The platform can help suggest investors\u2019 safe choice of investments while making sure investors get above-market average returns from their investments. The platform integrates an on-chain analysis tool, and a social sentiment indicator and notifies users of new presales and launches, helping them assess potentially highly rewarding cryptocurrencies. The token for the platform D2C is currently in phase 3 of its presale and has raised over $6.6 million so far. Given such a high investment, the project comes out to be potentially one of the best rewarding crypto projects once it lists on an exchange. Blockchains are constantly criticized for their high energy usage, and the consequent environmental harm they impose. However, there\u2019s a crypto project that aims to counteract the negative impact of crypto on the environment, by partnering with brands and helping them manage their carbon credits. When users shop with the brands associated with , they are rewarded with IMPT tokens which can be used to purchase carbon credits. Users can retire their Carbon credits in exchange for NFTs from popular artists or sell them as they see fit. As an investor, if you\u2019re looking for a high-value crypto project, IMPT should be under your consideration. The presale for the token is currently live, and they\u2019ve raised close to $13 million, more than halfway through their target for the presale. The play-to-earn ecosystem is said to thrive the most once crypto gaming becomes mainstream and Calvaria could potentially be among the top players ruling the industry. is a P2E game, played with NFT battle cards, where each card represents a character with a set of unique traits. With a combination of these cards, users advance in the game. Winners will be paid in RIA tokens, which can either be staked or can be used to make in-game purchases. Along with that, token holders also get the right to vote in the official DAO of the platform. The project is currently in phase 4 of its presale and has raised over 1.86 million USDT (roughly equal to the same in US dollars) so far. Investors willing to venture into the crypto play-to-earn ecosystem should consider IMPT as their choice of investment. Although all the tokens listed above have a low entry point and show a lot of potential, it\u2019s best for investors to conduct their research before investing in a crypto project. With that being said, the coins mentioned above could potentially deliver exponential returns, as long as they follow their roadmap and receive continuous support from the community.",

    "description": "GBTC shares keep getting cheaper versus Bitcoin \u2014 an ideal reason to buy for ARK Invest and Lawrence Lepard.",
    "content": "The largest Bitcoin ( BTC ) institutional investment vehicle is coming under suspicion as it trades at a record discount. The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) is the latest Bitcoin industry entity to feel the heat from the debacle over defunct exchange FTX . With contagion and fears over a deeper market rout everywhere in Bitcoin and altcoins at present, misgivings are impacting even the best-known \u2014 and trusted \u2014 crypto industry names. In recent days, it was the turn of GBTC, the long-embattled Bitcoin investment fund, amid problems at a related crypto firm, Genesis Trading. As Cointelegraph reported , parent company Digital Currency Group (DCG), as well as operator Grayscale itself, swiftly sought to reassure investors and the market that its flagship product was financially watertight. This did not appear enough to satisfy nerves, however, leading to additional public declarations of faith in DCG and GBTC. Among them was Coinbase Institutional, the institutional investment arm of major exchange Coinbase. \u201cNothing is more important than ensuring our clients' assets are safe,\u201d it tweeted on Nov. 17. GBTC\u2019s image has been under strain for some time. Since 2021, it has traded at a discount to the BTC spot price, a discount which is now approaching 50% . Amid a lack of demand, speculation has increased thanks to rumors that Grayscale may end up being bought should Genesis Trading fail. This change of tack could have implications for GBTC, as Grayscale notionally remains intent on converting it to an exchange-traded fund (ETF). \u201cThough this is a difficult moment for many in crypto, I am deeply optimistic about the future of this industry, Grayscale 's business, and the opportunity for investors,\u201d Grayscale CEO, Michael Sonnenshein, tweeted on Nov. 19. Consensus on the $10.5 billion GBTC potentially being forcibly sold remains weak. Related: Grayscale cites security concerns for withholding on-chain proof of reserves \u201cGenesis may go under, but I find the odds of GBTC trust being liquidated to be highly unlikely just given the cash cow that it has been,\u201d Lyle Pratt, creator of messaging platform Vida Global, reacted . The steepening discount following the FTX saga has meanwhile made GBTC a somewhat ironic \u201cbuy\u201d for names such as ARK Invest and Lawrence Lepard, investment manager at Equity Management Associates. \u201cLots of questions and DM's. Lepard view on Grayscale and GBTC Spoiler alert: I own it,\u201d he began a dedicated Twitter thread by saying over the weekend. On the topic of how bad the contagion could be for DCG and its family of firms, Leopard nonetheless acknowledged that it \u201cis impossible to know how much distress they are in.\u201d He continued to analyze the fallout should the worst-case scenario \u2014 bankruptcy \u2014 ensue.

    "description": "TIME spoke with Intuit's Sasan Goodarzi about how the slowing economy is affecting his customers and his top concerns as a CEO.",
    "content": "(To receive weekly emails of conversations with the world\u2019s top CEOs and business decisionmakers, click here .) In Silicon Valley, a land littered with success stories, Sasan Goodarzi\u2019s tale is anything but typical. Born in Tehran, he and his family immigrated to the U.S. to escape the Iranian Revolution. Within six months, his father died, forcing his older brothers to find a way to support the family. Coming to America as a 9-year-old, Goodarzi says he faced not just a new language and unfamiliar culture, but outright hatred and bullying in school, which stifled his love of learning and led to him graduating from high school in Orlando, Florida with a C-minus average. Goodarzi found his footing and ultimately rose to become chief executive of software stalwart, Intuit, in early 2019, after earning a master\u2019s in business administration from the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University and decades of experience in the tech sector. Still, his early struggles inform his management style and worldview. When global protests over Iran\u2019s treatment of women erupted in September, Goodarzi spoke out. \u201cThe amazing people of Iran are showing what they\u2019re made of,\u201d he wrote on Twitter in early September. \u201cHuge respect for the brave women who are risking their lives to let the world know the line has been crossed and are demanding their basic human rights. As a native Iranian, I stand with you and could not be more proud.\u201d A few weeks later, he urged his peers to get involved. \u201cIf you have a platform, make your voice count,\u201d he tweeted. Intuit, approaching its 40th anniversary in 2023, develops and operates a collection of software products and services aimed at helping individuals and small businesses manage their finances. But Goodarzi sums up the company\u2019s broader aims as a mission \u201cto power the prosperity of those that we serve.\u201d The Mountain View, Calif.-based company\u2019s offerings include TurboTax, QuickBooks, Credit Karma, Mint and Mailchimp. Since assuming the role of chief executive, Goodarzi has not only set ambitious goals for Intuit\u2019s growth, but has also made a bold public pledge to the company\u2019s customers. That is, to double the household savings rate for people using Intuit\u2019s services and to improve the success rate of small businesses on its platform by 10% over the national average\u2014both by 2025. The average U.S. household saved about 7.9% of its disposable income in the two years before the pandemic, according to the OECD, and only half of small businesses survive beyond their fifth year. To date, Goodarzi says Intuit has surpassed that small business success rate and is over halfway to the household savings rate goal. TIME spoke with Goodarzi recently about how the slowing economy is affecting his customers. He laid out one of his top concerns as a CEO, and talked about what it takes to get hired at Intuit. This interview has been condensed and edited for clarity. ( For coverage of the future of work, visit TIME.com/charter and sign up for the free Charter newsletter. ) Intuit has a portfolio of products that help individuals and businesses organize their finances. What are you seeing right now from your customers as inflation is putting a squeeze on consumers and small businesses? We have a lot of data. So we see consumer spending on our platform. We see bank account balances, because small businesses connect to bank accounts. We actually see the number of employees and we see worker hours paid and hours worked. And I would just say in this environment, believe it or not, small businesses and consumers are generally healthy. Now, let me tell you about both sides of the coin, so I don\u2019t mislead. The small businesses that we serve\u2014they are growing. Their biggest issue is they can\u2019t hire enough employees, and they\u2019re thriving. Consumers\u2019 unemployment is still very low. And when we look at account balances of consumers, they\u2019re actually better than they\u2019ve been in years. The other side of that is very real. Consumers and small businesses are paying more for rent. They\u2019re paying more for food. They\u2019re paying higher gasoline prices. And if you\u2019re a small business, you\u2019re also paying more for this very employee that you needed to hire now, versus five years ago. So that\u2019s taking a chunk out of the pocketbook. For about two years, many people weren\u2019t commuting to work, or going to stores and restaurants. So they saved money. But do you think something fundamentally changed during the pandemic? Are Americans being a little more cautious with their money\u2014saving more? What we\u2019ve experienced in the last 18 months is people were cooped up in their homes, and when they were un-cooped, people got out. They started spending money. They started traveling. That\u2019s why airlines are reporting great earnings or bullish futures. I think what you\u2019re starting to see now is consumers starting to pull back. They\u2019re starting to buy cheaper brands, although they\u2019re still spending their money. Why? Because they\u2019re having to pay more for gas. They\u2019re having to pay more for rent. They\u2019re having to pay a lot more for food. Sugar is up 70%, for example. So consumers are starting to be careful about spending less in other places. But I don\u2019t think that consumers are being smarter with their money. If they have it, they\u2019re going to spend it. As a CEO, what are your main challenges right now? The biggest one\u2014the thing we worry about most, that we talk about most\u2014is speed. It\u2019s about the velocity of innovation. It\u2019s about moving fast, allowing our engineers to code, versus being in meetings, or being part of a decision. Speed is a leadership decision, and a company at our scale, if you can move fast and deliver for your customers, it actually becomes an advantage. The second thing is always making sure that we\u2019re growing our employees and accessing great talent. We spend a lot of time talking about and architecting the company around speed and access to great talent. What roles are you looking to fill most at the moment? Is it programmers or something else? It\u2019s in engineering, but it\u2019s a couple of specific areas. The core element of our strategy is centered around data and artificial intelligence. Because it\u2019s all about how we leverage the data and how we apply AI to accelerate our innovation. Therefore, the areas where we have added a lot of talent\u2014and we continue to look for talent\u2014is data scientists, data engineers, systems engineers that can think from a systems perspective, and mobile application engineers. If you\u2019re someone who has that kind of expertise and you\u2019re interviewing at Intuit, is there a surefire way of getting the company interested in you? Well, let\u2019s use a data scientist as an example. We have a process that we call A for A, it\u2019s Assessing for Awesome. That includes a one-to-one conversation. But there\u2019s also a panel conversation of two or three people. That data scientist gets a case study, and they have to come in and present to that several-person panel, and explain how they would handle a situation. The things we look for from a data scientist is 1) Do they think about the problem from the lens of what they\u2019re going to do for the customer and the impact they\u2019re going to have for the customer? Because at the end of the day, our boss is the customer. And 2) Do they actually have the ability to apply their data science craft and demonstrate it, not just talk about it\u2014demonstrate their capability around what technologies they\u2019re familiar with, what code they\u2019re familiar with, where they think technology is going, and how they would apply that to the customer problem. And then, of course, the third thing is interaction. How do they interact? Are they going to be able to work on a team? Because a data scientist can\u2019t work alone. If I am hiring a data scientist executive, I\u2019m really looking for the same things. But also asking: Can they lead at scale? Do they know how to hire great people? What track record do they have of transforming an organization? Lots of people in your position are saying it\u2019s really difficult to hire great people with the job market still very competitive. Is Intuit doing anything differently as it relates to hiring? It\u2019s been a challenging environment to hire the best of the best. If we\u2019re competing with another company, once we get a candidate to visit and learn about the problems that they would solve for our customers versus somewhere else, our acceptance rate has been very, very high. They just felt like we had some hairy problems that they wanted to be a part of solving. Also, our attrition rate in the last year was five points lower than any of our peer companies. With all that said, access to talent has been hard, but we\u2019ve been able to achieve our hiring ramp in the last couple of years. Apart from this need to tackle thorny problems, what else do you think is drawing engineers to Intuit? Well, I\u2019ll tell you what I hear from the folks that we hire. I talk to new hires and I also spent a lot of my time doing chats with our frontline engineers at our different sites, particularly those that have been with us for one to three years. I get a firsthand feel for what they love, and also what we need to improve, which is a question I always ask them. The big thing is they like actually working on things that will impact another human being. They\u2019re working on a project that will give you early access to your refund by five days, or instant access to your tax refund. They\u2019re working on things that allow a customer to get paid much faster once they send an invoice. They\u2019re working on benefit programs as part of our payroll platform. They also love it because when their code gets deployed, they can see on the other end the actual impact it had on a human being. And it\u2019s a real impact, because it\u2019s about money. Those are the things that really get the heartbeats of those new hires going much faster, and why they choose to join the company. When you have those conversations with them, what are some of the things they say you need to improve? The consistent themes I hear: They love how customer-centric we are. They love our culture. They love how everybody\u2019s here to help each other collaborate and win. But they wish we would make decisions faster, and they wish they didn\u2019t have to attend as many meetings to get their work done. In all those areas, we\u2019re getting better, but I consistently hear the same thing. Meetings are a real thorny issue. Have you figured out a way of reducing meetings and accelerating actual work? If so, do you have any tips? First of all, we\u2019ve improved a lot in this area. We are nowhere near where we need to be. There\u2019s a couple of things we are doing. One is, we set no meetings in the afternoons for our engineers. One of the big things with engineers is you don\u2019t want to distract them. They can\u2019t code for an hour, jump into a meeting, come back and code for an hour, because they have to spend 20% of the time after they come back to figure out where they left off. So, now they always have four or five hours of uninterrupted coding time. That\u2019s working, and we continue to monitor it. We also realize it\u2019s not being followed everywhere in the company, so we keep working it out. That\u2019s a good one. Any other tips? The other is the concept of two-way doors versus one-way doors. The majority of decisions we make, there are two-way doors. If you make it and you made a mistake or it wasn\u2019t a good decision, you can come back in. A one-way door is you, once you make the decision, you can\u2019t just turn around and say, \u201cOh oops.\u201d If you pay $10 billion for an acquisition, you don\u2019t just turn around and say, \u201cOops.\u201d That\u2019s a one way door. So what we\u2019re working on is being clear, and it\u2019s something we\u2019re working on right now actually, is being clear that 95% plus of decisions are two-way doors, and to enable our teams to move without having to get into meetings. Because a lot of the meetings are two-way doors where you get into a meeting and you\u2019re presenting to management, you don\u2019t even need to do that, just go do it. But culturally, there is a sort of need for a manager wanting to call a meeting on something that they don\u2019t need to. So that\u2019s what we are working on, and we believe it will work. The other is continuing to get better at when you have a meeting, good hygiene. Why are you in the meeting? What decision are you going to make? Who are the three, four people you need in the meeting, versus 50 people in a meeting? And then it should be a decision meeting or an ideation meeting. You shouldn\u2019t get into a meeting just to inform someone and provide an update. That can be done asynchronously. So those are the things that we\u2019re working on. As we all emerge from the pandemic, what\u2019s your opinion about whether work needs to be done in the office or not? When the world shut down in March of 2020, we overnight went virtual with, right now we have over 17,000 employees. We went home overnight. And the good news is we\u2019re a technology company. We have all the tools and we could work virtually. And frankly, many things over time accelerated, because people were actually more productive and effective. So we felt like we needed to really step back and think about what we wanted to do, versus just assuming we all come back to work. What that means to us is that we announce that we\u2019re letting mission based teams decide which days they want to come together in the office and work, and which days they want to work virtually. We did not prescribe, \u201cYou have to be in the office Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday.\u201d We\u2019re letting teams do it, and the reason for that is when we sent everybody home overnight, we didn\u2019t give them instructions. Everybody just worked virtually, and then we figured out how to work in our mission based groups. So we are leveraging that learning as we\u2019re in a hybrid environment.

    "description": "The best way to honor her legacy is by documenting, amplifying, and paying attention to the attacks trans people are facing",
    "content": "Monica Roberts began tracking violence against the trans community in 2006, long before national organizations, governmental agencies, and, perhaps most important, the media, were paying close attention. Her award-winning blog, TransGriot , aggregated local news, police reports, and community-sourced information. Her no-frills style of reporting and her reputation as a trusted journalist and blogger in the community made her a critical resource. Tapping into a rich network of trans people on social media and tips received via email, Roberts was a go-to for trans activists across the country, particularly during a time when the media wasn\u2019t regularly reporting on the killings of trans people or doing so in a way that honored the lives of those lost. \u201cMonica was making sure that not only was she cataloging these murders, whenever there was an article that was written when the person was misgendered, she was able to write the article correctly,\u201d said trans activist Dee Dee Waters, who was also a longtime friend of Monica. \u201cIt was really good to have her, as we tried to conquer a lot of this transphobic stuff.\u201d In West African culture, a griot is a tribal storyteller who acts as an advisor to leaders and serves as a living archive. For more than a decade, Monica offered that crucial service to a community that is often overlooked and mistreated. When I worked at the New York City Anti-Violence Project (AVP) , part of my job was to track violence against LGBTQ people, and Monica\u2019s blog was invaluable. She regularly broke stories that went beyond the violence that trans communities disproportionately face. As a growing movement and understanding for trans communities progressed in the aughts, so did her coverage, with posts about trans people in politics, music, and TV and film . As individual states act with increasing hostility to trans people\u2014 The Washington Post reported that, as of Oct. 13, more than 155 pieces of anti-trans legislation had been introduced this year alone\u2014violence against the trans community is only going to get worse. These laws attack bodily autonomy and self-identification, as well as deny crucial medical care and have introduced harmful discussion about sexual orientation and gender identity. Which means we need people in the world\u2014from the mainstream media to elected officials to allies of trans and nonbinary people\u2014to sit up, pay attention, and spread the word of the ongoing violence trans people face. In the fall of 2020, Monica died at 56 years old . Her unexpected death, due to blood clots in her lungs, reverberated throughout the LGBTQ community. The Association of LGBTQ Journalists (NLGJA) lauded her groundbreaking journalism, and the National Association of Black Journalists (NABJ) posthumously inducted her to its hall of fame . Her blog now lives on as an archive , and more digital content will be produced by Transgriot LLC under the leadership of Waters, with plans to continue additional reporting on the issues facing Black trans Americans. The legacy she left is one of watching out for and taking care of her community, especially in moments when it seemed as if few outside of the community were listening or taking action. In one of Monica\u2019s last posts on anti-trans violence , she documented the murder of Selena Reyes Hernandez, who was shot and killed by 18-year-old Orlando Perez after she disclosed that she was transgender to him. \u201cShe is the sixth Latinx transperson to die in 2020 and the 14th transperson this year, but I\u2019m just now finding out about this May 31 murder because of misgendering of her by the Chicago medical examiner, Chicago PD and the Chicago media,\u201d wrote Roberts on her blog. \u201cEven her family went there in disrespecting her in death, choosing to bury her in her native Mexico under her deadname.\u201d Monica Roberts at the GLAAD Gala in San Francisco on Sept. 8, 2016. Kimberly White\u2014GLAAD/Getty Images In 2019, the American Medical Association (AMA) and the Human Rights Campaign (HRC) called the killings of trans Americans an epidemic following at least 28 homicides in 2018 and 25 homicides in 2019. \u201cAccording to available tracking, fatal anti-transgender violence in the U.S. is on the rise and most victims were black transgender women,\u201d said AMA board member S. Bobby Mukkamala, M.D., in a 2019 press release . \u201cThe number of victims could be even higher due to underreporting and better data collection by law enforcement is needed to create strategies that will prevent anti-transgender violence.\u201d Since then, homicides of trans people have doubled to historic levels of violence with limited media attention or public outcry. In 2020, there were at least 44 homicides of trans and nonbinary people, and 57 in 2021, and 33 so far through this year, according to Sue Kerr, a blogger and social worker who is one of the few individuals tracking violence against trans folks. \u201cWhen Kathryn Newhouse was killed in Georgia, nineteen, murdered by her father. And she\u2019s AAPI, she\u2019s autistic, and she has mental health issues. All these intersections, no one wrote about it,\u201d Kerr said about a murder that happened March . \u201cThe one thing I\u2019ve noticed that\u2019s a big difference from when I was writing these in \u201814, \u201815, \u201816, is that people on the ground, usually the friends of the deceased, are all over the media.\u201d This was the case for 28-year-old Brazil Johnson, who was shot and killed in Milwaukee, Wis., in June. Johnson\u2019s family and friend\u2019s described her to a local outlet as \u201ckind-hearted .\u201d The family and friends of 50 year-old Nedra Sequence Morris , who was killed in May, organized a vigil on her behalf to demand justice. The friends and community of trans people, commonly known as chosen family, now serve as unofficial media spokespersons, and become advocates for their friends, or loved ones after death. There are a handful of individuals and organizations across the country tracking the violence against trans people. The Anti-Violence Project ( AVP ) continues to lead a national coalition of organizations doing data collection on anti-LGBTQ violence. TransLashMedia , led by trans media personality Imara Jones, marks each trans individual\u2019s death on their Instagram channel. HRC also tracks anti-trans violence and releases an annual report . Every year the constant has been an emphasis from advocates to say \u201cat least\u201d alongside any number about the murder of trans people\u2014knowing that with the limited available tracking, there are names of trans people whose stories go untold. It\u2019s important to remember that violence against marginalized communities does not begin with murder. It starts with the acceptance, both passive and deliberate, of increasingly hateful rhetoric, which fuels legislation and emboldens people to commit acts of violence. Trans people, disproportionately Black trans women, are facing violence on the streets and from intimate partners, family, or co-workers, and from legislation that aims to dehumanize and ultimately eliminate trans people from the public space. There\u2019s a growing animus against trans people that manifests as violence in real life, and we must call it out for what it is. Every year, on Nov. 20, the LGBTQ community remembers the lives of those lost for the Transgender Day of Remembrance. This year\u2014and every year after\u2014Monica will be remembered as a ferocious leader who cared enough to look out for the needs of her community. She was not only taken too soon, and her absence from our movement will be felt immensely, her care and love for her community always remembered. The way to honor her legacy is for all of us to take up part of the work of documenting, amplifying, and paying attention to the attacks trans people are facing. We cannot stand by idly. We must demand justice. More Must-Reads From TIME Steven Spielberg Waited 60 Years to Tell This Story Who Should Be TIME's 2022 Person of the Year?

    "content": "While investors are eager to learn when they will be able to recover their funds from the now-defunct crypto exchange FTX, insolvency lawyers warn that it could take \u201cdecades.\u201d On November 11, the crypto exchange and 130 affiliates filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the United States. Insolvency lawyer Stephen Earel, partner at Co Cordis in Australia, stated that \u201crealizing\u201d the crypto assets and determining how to distribute the funds will be a \u201cenormous exercise\u201d in the liquidation process, which could take years, if not \u201cdecades.\u201d He attributes this to the complexities associated with cross-border insolvency issues and competing jurisdictions. Earel stated that FTX users are in the same line as everyone else, including creditors, investors, and venture capital funders, and that those who have made \u201ccrypto to crypto trades\u201d may not receive a distribution \u201cfor years.\u201d Simon Dixon, founder of global investment platform BnkToTheFuture and an active participant in the Celsius bankruptcy proceedings, stated that anyone who holds funds on FTX will become creditors, and a creditors committee will be formed to represent their interests. He stated that creditors will eventually be able to access the remaining assets, depending on what remains after bankruptcy costs. According to Binance Australia CEO, these costs could be high due to the time required to recover funds, which means more legal and administrative fees that eat into customers\u2019 returns. Meanwhile, Irina Heaver, Partner at Keystone Law in the UAE, said that users in the Middle East are also feeling the effects of the FTX collapse, as the region was the third largest FTX user base. Heaver explained that because FTX already has a license and regulatory supervision from Dubai\u2019s newly formed Virtual Assets Authority regulator (VARA), the regulators face major complications because they already have a \u201chuge regulatory failure\u201d on their hands. Heaver stated that creditors\u2019 rights will be overseen by the legal system, with courts and bankruptcy administrators involved \u201cwhen and if\u201d FTX enters Chapter 11 bankruptcy procedures. Heaver\u2019s advises people who have suffered significant losses as a result of the FTX collapse to seek legal counsel and join forces with \u201cother injured parties.\u201d The recent FTX collapse has had far-reaching consequences for investors worldwide. According to recent reports, the bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange may have \u201cmore than 1 million creditors.\u201d According to a Reuters article published on November 20, the bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange owes \u201cnearly $3.1 billion\u201d to its top 50 creditors.",

Buyers have been pressing against the barrier at $0.0001800 since November 10. The crypto\u2019s price has attempted to break through the resistance four times but has failed. As it crosses over the moving average lines today On the upside, the altcoin will go toward the next resistance at $0.0002200 if it breaks above the resistance level. But as long as buyers are unable to push the price over the resistance level of $0.0001800, the coin will continue to trade sideways between levels of $0.0001400 and $0.0001800. LBLOCK fell to a low of $0.0001444 on November 19 as it targets the $0.0002200 high. As it reaches the peak of $0.0001674, the bullish momentum has burst over the lines of the moving averages. The region of overbought has been reached by the current rise. The altcoin has a daily Stochastic level of 96. The overbought area is anticipated to offer resistance to LBLOCK. Furthermore, LBLOCK has recovered bullish momentum since its dip on November 9 as it approaches the resistance around $0.0001800. However, Dash 2 Trade, a different coin, has seen its value soar recently. This puts into more perspective the requirement for a cutting-edge trading intelligence platform, and that exactly is what . It is a platform that can adequately detect impending adverse issues similar to what happened to FTX, thus enabling investors and traders to pinpoint safe opportunities for good profits. The D2T token presale is ongoing and it has raised $6.5 million so far. You can purchase Lucky Block here. \u2022 \u2022",

While JHU is responsible for creating the site, additional contributions were made by NASA, the European Space Agency, the National Science Foundation, and the Sloan Foundation. The main page encourages you to scroll down as the viewer watches the number of celestial objects increase and then brings them to a 90-degree view of the night sky that has all 13.7 billion years of the cosmos right there in front of them. While this opening page serves as the summary of the interaction, the \u201cexplore the map\u201d and \u201cdescription\u201d links at the bottom of the page allow the viewer to examine the map in more detail. \u201cExplore the map\u201d lets the viewer scroll back in time in 100-million-year increments all the way to the edge of the observable universe, also known as the Cosmic Microwave Background, while they are provided detailed descriptions of various celestial objects during their journey, which include several types of galaxies and quasars. \u201cDescription\u201d does an excellent job answering questions in detail that the viewer might be asking throughout their journey pertaining to both the map and the instruments that were used to gather the data. These include easy-to-understand figures and diagrams. At the bottom, the viewer is also given the option to either download or purchase the map for their own personal or educational purposes. Overall, this interactive map is small, easy-to-use, and concise in its ability to share the entirety of the cosmos with easy-to-understand descriptions that are likely suitable for astronomy lovers as young as grade school.

    "content": "Customers of the decentralized exchange (DEX) section would reportedly pay gas charges for swaps that are at least 10% less than those of 1inch\u2019s prior offers, making switching activity on the Ethereum network more lucrative for its users. In the Router v5, 1inch predicted that swaps would be 10% more gas efficient compared to the second-best participant in the DEX segment and about 5% more gas efficient than in the previous edition. A new interaction logic, pre-/post-interactions, and an upgraded smart contract error processing system are among the new features and advancements brought to the Router v5 from earlier routers. The latest edition has undergone audits from almost a dozen industry initiatives, including Consensys, OpenZeppelin, and ABDK Consulting, and is also intended to prioritize security. Co-founder of 1inch Network Sergej Kunz said \u201cWe have gathered enough improvements since the 1inch Router v4 was published to warrant the introduction of the new fifth version. [\u2026] In comparison to utilizing any other DeFi device, our users will now save at least 8\u201314% more because to our improved gas cost optimization.\u201d The 1inch Network would implement the 1inch Aggregation Protocol and the 1inch Limit Order Protocol on Avalanche and Gnosis Chain, formerly known as the xDai Chain at the start of the year. In order to give its user base with access to the 1inch Limit Order Protocol v2, as well as deeper liquidity and improved token swaps via the 1inch network, 1inch connected with Klaytn, South Korea\u2019s most well-known metaverse blockchain, in August. The Router v5 is the newest router by DEX aggregator 1inch. The business said that by lowering gas prices for swaps, Router v5 will make consumers\u2019 experiences with decentralized finance (DeFi) more convenient.",

With the beginning of the proceedings of the FTX bankruptcy lawsuit, the exchange said that they owed more than $3 billion to their top 50 creditors. Moreover, it mentioned that it owes nearly $1.45 billion to the top 10 creditors, without naming them. The exchange during the court proceedings said that it was reviewing the assets they have and are preparing for the sale or reorganization of some business. However, as per an expert, the top creditors or the equity holders may be given the first preference for restructuring, while the investors in the Bahamas-based companies may be the next ones to receive.\u00a0 Meanwhile, the FTX account holders could be their least priority as they stand at the end of the queue.\u00a0 yikes.. reason why rich gets richer and retail gets fucked pic.twitter.com/7HvOqYJVzw\u2014 frxresearch (@frxresearch) November 21, 2022 On the other hand, FTX\u2019s sister concern, Alameda Research, a trading platform, has transferred nearly $37 million USDC to an address named FalconX. This is speculated to be user\u2019s funds which were squeezed without intimating them. Meanwhile, the so-called \u2018hacker\u2019 who stole assets worth more than $600 million swapped them into ETH & stablecoins. In a recent update, these ETH were further traded into wBTC & renBTC through aggregators like 1Inch. Therefore, it is pretty clear that the retail traders who traded on FTX exchanges on a daily basis and kept the platform active are the least considered for any restructuring. Moreover, the user\u2019s funds which were stolen, have been utilised. Hence, a re-broadcast of MT. Gox\u2019s rehabilitation plan is expected to repeat, and retail investors may wait for a long time to retrieve their lost funds.",

He is also interested in purchasing some parts of the troubled FTX cryptocurrency exchange. Garlinghouse thinks that if transparency and trust are kept as a priority, the cryptocurrency sector will grow stronger. He places a high value on bitcoin because it gives individuals the opportunity to reject the private monopoly and control over people\u2019s assets for the first time in history \u201cPart of my conversation [with SBF] as if he needs liquidity, maybe there are businesses that he has bought or he has that we would want to own. Maybe there are investments that we would want own. Would we have bought some of those from him? I think that was on the table.\u201d On Nov. 16 and 17, 2022, during the 6th annual RippleSwell conference in London, Mr. Garlinghouse revealed that former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried had called him two days prior to the company declaring bankruptcy in an effort to gather investors to save it. He also took to Twitter and explained in a long thread \u201cWith all that\u2019s happening in the past few weeks (and over the course of this year\u2019s ups and downs), it feels even more imperative that we\u2019ve gathered together in person to have honest conversations about solving real-world problems with crypto and blockchain. As I said on stage \u2013 I firmly believe that crypto will be stronger because of this if we keep focusing on transparency and trust. Ripple has and will continue to lead in this regard.\u201d What\u2019s Next For Ripple Vs SEC? Regarding the SEC\u2019s (Securities and Exchange Commission) lawsuit against Ripple, founder Chris Larsen, and co-founder Garlinghouse, Brad Garlinghouse and Stuart Alderoty both anticipate a decision in the first half of 2023. Final legal briefs must be submitted by Nov. 30 in order for the court to make a decision or schedule a jury trial.",

This is revealed as the bulls seem to have been on a winning streak, after price action tested the floor of the Bollinger indicator. Additionally, price activity seems to have found support at the MA line. Consequently, this implies that we are more likely to witness additional upside moves in Lucky Block price.

Here on the 1-hour chart, we can see that price candles bounced off the Bollinger band but soon resumed their upward path. Subsequently, this resulted in to price rising higher and has placed price further above the MA line. Likewise, the RSI lines are now in the overbought region with the two lines seem positioned to continue in that region. Technically, market signs are aligned to portray possible additional upward move in the price above the $0.0001700. More like what we have here on the LBLOCK market, there is another crypto called the Impact Token. Its presale is still ongoing and has raised approximately $13 million within weeks of its presale. This is because the token is eco-friendly and is attractive to investors, as a result, this supplies bullish sentiment to the token.

He referred to the possibility of a meltdown as \u201cgame over for the games,\u201d meaning that it would be impossible to continue playing. game over for the games, certainly.\u2014 jack (@jack) November 16, 2022 Moreover, Markus is certain that this situation would definitely provoke a \u201cbigger than projected Monday market meltdown.\u201d Cryptocurrency investors have historically responded to disruptions like the recent FTX debacle by selling off their holdings in the market in a frenzy. As a result of all this doubt, some people have even declared Bitcoin \u201cdead.\u201d Does Bitcoin Stand A Chance? According to the analyst\u2019s assessment, the leading cryptocurrency is still active and growing in popularity around the world despite having \u201cdied\u201d more than 460 times. As a result of its restricted supply, it has become legal tender in countries with struggling economies such as El Salvador and the Central African Republic, and many investors see it as a way to protect themselves from inflation. Binance Is Secure, Claims Zhao\u00a0 Many market participants anticipated that the FTX issue would trigger a domino effect and pull other exchanges into the muck, however, the reality was different and the impact wasn\u2019t as bad.\u00a0 The largest cryptocurrency exchange, Binance, on the other hand, confirmed that its financial sheet was stable and even increased the amount of its Secure Asset Fund for Users (SAFU) to $1 billion to protect users in a catastrophe. In addition, the corporation established a recovery fund for the industry, which is intended to assist projects that are having difficulty during difficult economic times. To disprove the allegations, CEO Zhao publicly said that Binance is establishing an industry recovery fund to assist projects that are otherwise robust but are experiencing a liquidity problem. This will serve to lessen the negative effects of FTX that will continue to cascade. We\u2019ll have more information soon.\u00a0 Meanwhile, he issued a challenge to anyone seeking additional information to get in touch with Binance Labs.",

    "content": "According to analyst Benjamin Cowen, BTC could be flashing a bottom signal. Amid rumors threatening to drop BTC to $13k, market participants are still long-term bullish. While several foreboding rumors making the rounds in the crypto market have seen the price of Bitcoin (BTC) dump to less than $16,000, analysts are still confident that the pioneer digital currency could have reached a cyclical bottom. According to popular crypto market analyst Benjamin Cowen, the BTC percentage of supply in profit and loss metric is flashing signs of a historical bottom for the asset. He told his over 774,000 YouTube subscribers that the metric is one of his favorites as it shows the ebb and flow of the market during bear and bull markets. In previous years including 2011, 2014, 2015, 2018, and 2019 when this metric crossed over the 30-day moving average, it accurately marked the bottom of the BTC market. One of my favorite on-chain indicators is the Bitcoin percentage of supply in profit and loss. The reason I like this one is because of how cyclical it looks \u2013 the ebb and flow of this indicator\u2026 If you apply the [30-day] moving average to [the Bitcoin percentage of supply in profit and loss]\u2026 what you\u2019ll notice is that historically, they have always crossed before the bottom was in, His analysis is coming at a time when the price of BTC has hit $15,800 for the first time since 2020. According to an analysis by Santiment, the drop was thanks to fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) due to a lack of trust in exchanges, especially since the FTX exchange collapsed. Exacerbating the situation is the roster of firms that have been run aground or are likely to suffer losses. One of these that have been rumored to be in trouble is Digital Currency Group (DCG), the parent company of Genesis and Grayscale. Read More: BREAKING: DCG didn\u2019t find investors, will Bitcoin and the whole crypto market implode? Report Another FUD-creating event that is shaking the market is the movement of crypto assets in the wallet of the hacker of the FTX exchange. Blockchain security firm Chainalysis said in a tweet that the FTX hacker has been bridging ETH to BTC. The notice added that the asset is likely to be mixed as the hacker may attempt to cash out through exchanges. \ud83d\udea81/ Funds stolen from FTX are on the move and exchanges should be on high alert to freeze them if the hacker attempts to cash out \u2014 Chainalysis (@chainalysis) November 20, 2022 Market analyst still sees a price explosion for BTC in early 2023 Amid the various speculations that BTC could drop to as low as $13,000, analysts are still long-term bullish for the benchmark crypto. Billionaire venture capitalist Tim Draper said in a recent interview that he still expects BTC to reach $250,000 by early 2023, sticking to his prediction from last year. Draper said that he expects the price target to be reached once the market recovers from the massive FUD and people, especially women, start using Bitcoin for daily shopping. He noted that women\u2019s interest in crypto is already showing signs of increasing, having recently grown from controlling 7.14 percent of Bitcoin wallets to 16.6 percent.

    "content": "The post Ben Armstrong Says \u2018Crypto is Not Dead\u2019, Supports With Evidence appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The FTX crisis and the lowest levels of Bitcoin trading have led to the widespread belief that the crypto industry is dead. Top YouTuber Ben Armstrong, better known as Bitboy, said that cryptocurrency is not dead and will not be, regardless of what happens next. In 2022, Bitcoin has dramatically decreased in value from its all-time high of $69,000 reached in November 2021, having lost 76% of its value in a single year. Crypto is not dead. NO MATTER what happens with GBTC/Genesis/Silvergate.., remember this:When $BTC was barely relevant Mtgox was hacked. 90% of Bitcoin transactions happened there. Almost the entire market at one place\u2026 gone\u2026 poof.And we survived and thrived.\u2014 Ben Armstrong (@Bitboy_Crypto) November 19, 2022 He uses the failure of Mt. Gox, one of the biggest Bitcoin exchanges at the time, as evidence, claiming that the market rebounded well. The Mt. Gox exchange crashed in February 2014 as a result of a major 840,000 BTC hack. A record-breaking high of about $1,100 had been reached by Bitcoin only a few months prior, and Mt. Gox accounted for the majority of transactions\u2014about 90%\u2014at that time. Ben Armstrong predicted the FTX crash? Ben came close to predicting what would occur days in advance, though, so it is important to note that. \u201cIf you don\u2019t close your FTX account today and get your funds off that exchange ASAP, I\u2019m sorry, but you are the definition of low IQ and deserve what\u2019s going to happen to you.\u201d And two weeks later, after everything unraveled, FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried told his clients he was, quote, \u201creally sorry we ended up here,\u201d he had said on Twitter. If you don\u2019t close your @FTX_Official account today and get your funds off that exchange ASAP\u2026 I\u2019m sorry but you are the definition of Low IQ and you deserve what\u2019s going to happen to you.\u2014 Ben Armstrong (@Bitboy_Crypto) October 29, 2022 Armstrong specifically said that Sam Bankman-Fried is urging lawmakers to pass legislation that would rigorously control the cryptocurrency industry. He also pledged to reveal many additional wrongdoings committed by SBF. Additionally, Bitboy asserted that FTX was taking advantage of its users in late October when the exchange\u2019s API was abused. The blogger had already made disparaging remarks about both the exchange and its leader, Bankman-Fried, before the entire incident.",

Grayscale GBTC Trust, the largest legal holder of BTC, refuses to provide any Proof of Reserve. To begin a community lead effort at transparency for the GBTC holdings, we have taken steps to ID likely GBTC addresses and balances based on public info and blockchain forensics. pic.twitter.com/WFtOyoCEay \u2014 \ud83c\udff4\u2234Ergo\u2234\ud83c\udff4 (@ErgoBTC) November 20, 2022 Per the analysis, Ergo reveals that they have identified 432 addresses holding about 317,705 BTC, likely part of the GBTC reserves. It is worth noting that the team started its analysis around July 2019, when Grayscale moved custody of its assets to Coinbase from Xapo. Grayscale declined to release a proof-of-reserves in response to community demands citing security concerns inspiring the effort from Ergo. In the wake of the FTX collapse, the crypto community speculates that Digital Currency Group, the parent company of Genesis Trading, Grayscale, and CoinDesk, is the next domino to fall. It comes after Genesis Trading, arguably crypto\u2019s biggest lender announced its decision to halt operations despite receiving a capital infusion from DCG to cater for the loss of $175 million in assets in the FTX collapse. However, a Wall Street Journal report cites illiquid assets in its balance sheet as the reason for halting withdrawals. The report also indicates it sought $1 billion in capital to resume operations. Genesis is seen as the go-to for institutions and whales looking to lend crypto to earn yield. Consequently, several industry pundits have asserted that a Genesis collapse could have a bigger ripple effect than FTX. Already, Gemini has been forced to halt its earn program. In light of recent information, users speculate DCG itself may be insolvent. According to North Rock Digital founder Hal Press, the size of funds required indicates that the liability lies with DCG . Consequently, users have also called to question the health of the Grayscale trust. Notably, Coinbase released a letter today to assure users of the safety of Grayscale assets in its cold storage wallets. \u201cCoinbase Custody Trust Company, LLC (Coinbase Custody) writes to you to reaffirm that the assets underlying all of Grayscale\u2019s digital asset products held at Coinbase Custody, as listed in the table below, are secure,\u201d Furthermore, it asserts that each user\u2019s assets are kept separately to avoid mixing user assets. \u201cCoinbase Custody always ensures that each client\u2019s digital assets are segregated on-chain, in deep cold-storage, from both the property of Coinbase Custody and the assets of other Coinbase Custody clients,\u201d Coinbase writes. \u201cThis means that the digital assets underlying each Grayscale product will never be commingled with or confused for the digital assets of any other client. This also means that the digital assets of each Grayscale product can be confirmed on-chain.\u201d Despite these assurances, the community continues to frown at the refusal of the exchange to reveal the wallet addresses. Messari founder Ryan Selkis in a tweet today, asserted that this week is likely to be a turbulent one for DCG and its subsidiaries. GBTC continues to trade at a 43% discount to the actual Bitcoin price indicating investor bearishness.

The series follows a group of immigrants heading to New York when they encounter a ship that went missing four months earlier. Throw in some mysterious incidents, a creepy kid, and some unsettling backstories, and you have 1899.

During their journey, the ship comes across another vessel that disappeared four months earlier, <a href=\"https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/1899-how-ships-names-kerberos-prometheus-might-play-role-understanding-netflix-mystery.html/\">called the Prometheus</a>. Both ships belong to the same company, but most believed the Prometheus was lost at sea.

However, knowing Odar and Friese are behind it means not everything is as it seems.</p> <p><em>1899</em> uses a lot of symbolism throughout all eight episodes. The upside-down triangle is shown the most, and viewers catch glimpses of the symbol in everything from clothing to jewelry. Each episode focuses on the backstory of a different passenger. That passenger, in particular, starts off the episode by hearing a voice say, \u201cWake up.\u201d When they open their eyes, audiences see their pupils are shaped like an upside-down triangle.</p> <figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\"> <div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"1899 | Official Trailer | Netflix\" width=\"925\" height=\"520\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/p7OUQ9U2qIw?start=46&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div> </div></figure> <p><strong>RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/netflixs-1899-i-watched-all-8-episodes-still-no-idea-whats-going-on.html/\">Netflix\u2019s \u20181899\u2019: I Watched All 8 Episodes and Still Have No Idea What\u2019s Going On</a></strong></p> <h2 id=\"h-comic-book-artist-mary-cagnin-calls-1899-identical-to-her-story-black-silence\">Comic book artist Mary Cagnin calls \u20181899\u2019 \u2018identical\u2019 to her story \u2018Black Silence\u2019</h2> <p>Over the Nov. 19, 2022, weekend, Cagnin posted on Twitter claiming that Netflix, along with Friese and Odar, used a plot that\u2019s startingly similar to her original idea.

Subtle plot details, such as the characters\u2019 personal dramas, including their mysterious deaths.\u201d</p> <p>Cagnin believes Netflix and showrunners got the idea when she appeared at an \u201cinfluential and international fair in Europe\u201d called the Gothenburg Book Fair in 2017.</p> <p>She also adds, \u201cI\u2019ve been on panels and distributed the <em>Black Silence</em> comic to countless publishers and people in the business. It\u2019s not hard to imagine my work reaching out to them. I not only delivered the physical comic but also made the translated version available in English.\u201d</p> <p>Cagnin concludes the thread by stating that even though <em>Black Silence</em> is a short story, \u201cthe essence of what she created\u201d is found in the Netflix series <em>1899.</em></p> <figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\"> <div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"1899 | Official Teaser | Netflix\" width=\"925\" height=\"520\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ulOOON_KYHs?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div> </div></figure> <h2>Several people disagree with Cagnin\u2019s claims</h2> <p>Not everyone jumped on board with Cagnin\u2019s claims that Netflix\u2019s <em>1899</em> is a blatant rip-off of her story <em>Black Silence.</em> Many think that the connection between the two is flimsy at best.</p> <p>One Twitter user <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ern_ygr/status/1594562923904761856?s=20&t=bFF6Ga6-5hLY7sZF2Ynqdw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">wrote</a>, \u201cThe reason for this blowing up is that the prospect of \u2018catching\u2019 a Netflix show for plagiarism is a much more exciting narrative to spread as opposed to simply looking into the matter and accepting that her accusations borderline delusional so far it seems.\u201d</p> <p>Another <a href=\"https://twitter.com/IDEASOFICE_FIRE/status/1594544465070342144?s=20&t=bFF6Ga6-5hLY7sZF2Ynqdw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Twitter</a> user added, \u201cI have to say, after reading the English translation of this comic it\u2019s not similar enough to 1899 for this to count as plagiarism in my opinion.\u201d</p> <p>Netflix hasn\u2019t commented on the matter as of this time.</p> <p><strong>RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/1899-netflixs-biggest-mystery-year.html/\">\u20181899\u2019 Looks Like Netflix\u2019s Biggest Mystery of the Year so Far</a></strong></p>",

Ortega\u2019s highly-anticipated Netflix series, <em>Wednesday</em>, is set to premiere in just a couple of days. Meanwhile, Ziegler recently wrapped her very first lead role in the upcoming film, <em><a href=\"https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/maddie-ziegler-blew-director-new-movie-bloody-hell-away.html/\">Bloody Hell</a></em>. But despite their actors\u2019 demanding schedules, they seem to make time for each other and maintain their friendship. In fact, Ziegler recently showed her support for Ortega at the Los Angeles premiere of <em><a href=\"https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/wednesday-jenna-ortega-biggest-concern-addams-family-series.html/\">Wednesday</a></em>.</p> <figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"823\" src=\"https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Jenna-Ortega.jpg\" alt=\"Jenna Ortega wears black to the 'Wednesday' premiere which Maddie Ziegler also attended\" class=\"wp-image-3271286\" srcset=\"https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Jenna-Ortega.jpg 1200w, https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Jenna-Ortega.jpg?w=640&h=439 640w, https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Jenna-Ortega.jpg?w=768&h=527 768w, https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Jenna-Ortega.jpg?w=1024&h=702 1024w, https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Jenna-Ortega.jpg?w=87&h=60 87w, https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Jenna-Ortega.jpg?w=150&h=103 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" /><figcaption>Jenna Ortega | Michael Tullberg/FilmMagic</figcaption></figure> <h2 id=\"h-how-did-jenna-ortega-and-maddie-ziegler-meet\">How did Jenna Ortega and Maddie Ziegler meet?</h2> <p>Ortega and Ziegler became fast friends after they were cast in <em>The Fallout</em>. Prior to filming,<a href=\"https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/dance-moms-kenzie-maddie-ziegler-tried-quit-years.html/\"> the <em>Dance Moms </em>alum</a> paid the <em>You</em> actor a visit. Though they\u2019d met in passing at a photoshoot years before, they wanted to get to know each other a bit more. Since their characters in the film (Vada and Mia) end up striking up a friendship, they wanted to form a genuine connection. Fortunately, the pair ended up hitting it off immediately, and they spent 13 straight hours just sitting and talking.</p> <h2>\u2018The Fallout\u2019 actors are very similar in some ways </h2> <p>And it seems that the actors have sustained their friendship even after they wrapped <em>The Fallout</em>.

    "description": "New AI aims to democratize 3D content creation, no modeling skills required.",
    "content": "Enlarge / A poison dart frog rendered as a 3D model by Magic3D. (credit: Nvidia) On Friday, researchers from Nvidia announced Magic3D, an AI model that can generate 3D models from text descriptions. After entering a prompt such as, \"A blue poison-dart frog sitting on a water lily,\" Magic3D generates a 3D mesh model, complete with colored texture, in about 40 minutes. With modifications, the resulting model can be used in video games or CGI art scenes. In its academic paper, Nvidia frames Magic3D as a response to DreamFusion, a text-to-3D model that Google researchers announced in September. Similar to how DreamFusion uses a text-to-image model to generate a 2D image that then gets optimized into volumetric NeRF (Neural radiance field) data, Magic3D uses a two-stage process that takes a coarse model generated in low-resolution and optimizes it to higher-resolution. According to the paper's authors, the resulting Magic3D method can generate 3D objects two times faster than DreamFusion. Magic3D can also perform prompt-based editing of 3D meshes. Given a low-resolution 3D model and a base prompt, it is possible to alter the text to change the resulting model. Also, Magic3D's authors demonstrate preserving the same subject throughout several generations (a concept often called coherence) and applying the style of a 2D image (such as a cubist painting) to a 3D model.Read 3 remaining paragraphs | Comments",

He mainly removed those who were not following him. Cuban claimed he was still interested in cryptocurrency. However, after he claimed last month that cryptocurrency had grown rather monotonous, many saw it as an indication that he would be moving away from it. As FTX plummeted within only 2 days this month, tremendous activity ended a four-month sideways trend in cryptocurrency and made it once again exciting. After those incidents, many cryptocurrency investors pledged to keep investing, including Cuban. However, some people now interpret the unfollowing of Cuban as an attempt to separate himself from the cryptocurrency community. Mark Cuban unfollowed MetaMask, DeFi Pulse, The Block, Uniswap, Nansen, and Solana. The post Is Mark Cuban Taking Time Off Crypto? appeared first on Crypto Academy.",

    "content": "The post Bitcoin is Breaking Down While the Hash Rate Marks new ATH, Are the Bottoms In? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The bitcoin price is heading to form new bottoms, as after rebounding a couple of times, it dropped below $16,000 and formed new yearly lows at $15,476. The capitulation period, which is speculated to have begun with the fresh sell-offs, is expected to drag the BTC price lower as the MVRV ratio has plunged below 0.6. The ratio has plunged to these levels only a couple of times in the past decade, in Jan 2015 and December 2018. Meanwhile, the capitulation appears extremely high but the possibility of a bullish reversal from the bottom appears high.\u00a0 With the recent drop in the prices, the traders are experiencing huge losses and they may be compelled to liquidate their assets at a loss. As per the on-chain data provider, Santiment, the network has recorded the lowest amount of BTC transactions in Profit since 2019. The $BTC drop below $15.8k has caused many traders to finally exit the sector or liquidate assets. #Bitcoin is seeing the lowest level of transactions made while in profit since Nov, 2019. Bounces typically occur when this metric is severely negative. https://t.co/siuHaH2bd8 pic.twitter.com/60HaSo0eqb\u2014 Santiment (@santimentfeed) November 21, 2022 The BTC ratio of daily on-chain transaction volume in profit to loss has slashed to -0.390 from the levels within the positive range. Meanwhile, the ETH ratio also has dropped to -0.30, indicating that traders facing extreme losses at the moment.\u00a0 The BTC long-term holders were at loss for a pretty long-time. However, the rise in the BTC hash rate, which marked new highs, has made it more difficult for the miners to sustain. The Bitcoin hash rate, which determines the total computing power required to mine and process the transactions on the blockchain, has marked new highs. With a rise in the BTC hash rate to 316 TH/s, the miners may now face actual pressure as they appeared to be hoaxed at the present prices. Hence, many may be compelled to sell their holdings to compensate for the mining activities.\u00a0 Collectively, Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) price appears to be in extreme danger as all the technical & on-chain indicators point toward a bearish close for the month. Meanwhile, some volatility may be expected as the trade approaches the end of the yearly trade, but if the bulls remain aloof, the price may eventually mark a bearish close for the year 2022.\u00a0",

    "description": "The daughter of Kim Jong Un who was recently seen in public for the first time at a missile launch site is his second child, South Korea\u2019s spy agency says.",
    "content": "SEOUL, South Korea \u2014 The daughter of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un who was recently seen in public for the first time at a missile launch site is his second child, South Korea\u2019s spy agency told lawmakers Tuesday, as speculation swirled about his motives for bringing her to the attention of the outside world. On Saturday, North Korea said that Kim observed the launch of the country\u2019s most powerful intercontinental ballistic missile \u2014 Hwasong-17 \u2014 the previous day with his wife Ri Sol Ju and their \u201cbeloved daughter.\u201d State media released photos showing Kim walking hand-in-hand with a young girl clad in a white coat and red shoes past a massive missile placed on a launch truck, and watching a soaring weapon from a distance. [time-brightcove not-tgx=\u201dtrue\u201d] In a closed-door briefing at a parliament committee, South Korea\u2019s National Intelligence Service, the country\u2019s main spy agency, told lawmakers that it assesses the daughter is Kim\u2019s second child named Ju Ae, Yoo Sang-bum, one of the lawmakers who attended the meeting, said. Youn Kun-young, who also attended the NIS briefing, confirmed the substance of Yoo\u2019s comments but refused to provide further details. The daughter apparently is Kim\u2019s child who retired NBA star Dennis Rodman saw during his trip to Pyongyang in 2013. After that Pyongyang visit, Rodman told the British newspaper Guardian that he and Kim had a \u201crelaxing time by the sea\u201d with the leader\u2019s family and that he held Kim\u2019s baby daughter, named Ju Ae. It was the first time North Korea officially confirmed her existence. North Korea\u2019s state media didn\u2019t disclose the age, name and other details of Kim\u2019s daughter last week. South Korean media have speculated Kim married Ri in 2009 and that they have three children, who were born in 2010, 2013 and 2017, respectively. Kim, 38, is a third generation of his family to run North Korea since 1948. He inherited power in late 2011 upon the death of his father Kim Jong Il. Kim and his father were both first mentioned in state media dispatches after they became adults. Given that, the revealing of the daughter believed to be in her early teens came as a surprise to outside observers. Some experts say the daughter\u2019s disclosing at a missile test site showed that Kim was emboldened by his advancing nuclear arsenal, the backbone of his family\u2019s rule. Others speculate if Kim continues to bring her to major public events, that could suggest that Kim might have her as his early heir apparent in his mind.",

    "content": "The post Your Identity Reimagined With NFTID appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News As it stands now, when you have to prove your identity, you need to provide several different forms of documentation. It could be a driver\u2019s license, a passport, a social security card, a utility bill, a bank statement, or any number of sources. Sometimes, you even need more than one or two of them! It can get pretty confusing, and it\u2019s a bit scary to think that your information is floating around out there on pieces of paper in other people\u2019s possession. Thankfully, Rebus is using NFT technology and Web3 to reimagine how we view our identity \u2013 and give control back to the person to whom it belongs. NFTs give us the ability to assign unique values and ownership to many different types of objects and assets. That means it\u2019s also possible to create NFTs for your identity! This NFTID (nifdy) decentralized identification system can be used worldwide by individuals or organizations. Rebus has created Rebus Nation to test this idea and measure its potential. While NFTID won\u2019t replace your legal documents, but it gives people the opportunity to identify themselves in a totally unique way. For instance, you can deviate from the format of your legal documents by inputting your name in all lowercase letters. You can even put in a set of completely fictitious data. Then you choose which pieces of information are available to others. Even minors can set up NFTID if they\u2019re savvy enough to navigate the DeFi protocol. So how does it work? Well, there are two main components of the NFTID system. The ID storage system is where your information is contained. It\u2019s implemented as a custom application on the Rebus blockchain and handles all information relative to your NFTID. It stores the NFTID type, organization, wallet address, ID, EncryptioKey, and MetaDataURL. The custom user interface is what allows the user to access their NFTID. Once the NFTID is created, the user interface will generate a preview image that will be publicly available and a private, encrypted image available only to the holder. There\u2019s only one rule. Users must respect the identities of others and treat them with respect. Even though NFTID is currently only in v1, Rebus is developing v1 in accordance with features and functionality to be added later. Entire communities will be able to base their membership on NFTIDs, organizations can create their own NFTID sets, and individuals can create comprehensive NFTIDs for themselves. The total utility of NFTIDs has not yet been realized, but once the idea becomes even more widespread, the potential is endless. Building a strong community around non-fungible assets is the primary goal, with an ever expanding future of utility. Disclaimer: This is a press release post.

    "content": "Oeiras, Portugal, 22nd November, 2022, Chainwire Masterblox, a Lisbon-based crypto marketing company, has pledged to bring greater gender parity to the world of web3. Masterblox CEO Isabella H\u00e4ndel is on a mission to highlight the shortage of women working in the industry in a bid to foster greater inclusivity. It is estimated that 85% of all crypto users and workers are male; Isabella is one of the rare women who\u2019ve made it all the way to the top. The industry is slowly becoming more gender inclusive, however, with female-centric projects like NFT collection World of Women gaining traction. Not only that, but female talent is being rewarded with leadership positions at an increasing rate. This trend is especially true among the younger demographics, as millennial women are becoming aware of the potential of blockchain technology and the diverse range of employment opportunities it offers. Isabella H\u00e4ndel is determined to lead by example in the hope that her success with Masterblox will inspire other women to follow suit. Her leadership skills have been fundamental to the success of Masterblox, where she is responsible for ensuring the quality of the company\u2019s services and maintaining its extensive network of contacts and clients. Isabella has risen to the top of her profession at just 25 years of age. Before joining the blockchain industry, she studied traditional marketing and worked for several large corporations such as Siemens and Volkswagen. At the outset of the pandemic, Isabella began delving deeper into web3 and studying any relevant material she could get her hands on. She was pleasantly surprised by the lack of gender discrimination, finding the web3 community to be incredibly welcoming of women in general. In 12 months, Isabella rose to become the CEO at Masterblox. She is now responsible for leading and managing a team of over 30 professionals from different backgrounds, which includes marketers, copywriters, designers, and growth hacking experts. To help women leave an even deeper imprint within the web3 industry, German-Brazilian Isabella has plans to hire more female talent for Masterblox throughout 2023. She believes there is plenty of space for women within web3 and that the industry has everything to gain by becoming more gender-neutral. Isabella has extended a call to talented women with experience in crypto and marketing to reach out to Masterblox and take the next step in their career journey. About Masterblox Masterblox is a Lisbon-based web3 accelerator. Its work is divided between the foundation, which handles all the connections between VCs, partners and projects, and the labs, where its growth hacking methods and support services are provided to the projects within the acceleration program. Masterblox\u2019s labs are responsible for assisting countless DeFi and blockchain projects with marketing, market making, copywriting, social media management, and much more.

    "content": "Genesis Trading, a pioneer in the cryptocurrency industry, has issued a warning that it may be in bankruptcy after its lending arm ceased operations last week and spent the weekend trying to raise money without success. In 2013, Genesis opened the first over-the-counter Bitcoin trading desk. Since then, it has grown to be a major participant in the market. However, following FTX\u2019s disastrous collapse, the business was dealing with \u201cabnormal withdrawal demands\u201d and was looking for a $1 billion loan last week. Following the collapse of FTX, an increasing number of cryptocurrency firms are in danger of going under. Despite the allegations, Genesis claims it has no such intentions. \u201cWe have no plans to file bankruptcy imminently. Our goal is to resolve the current situation consensually without the need for any bankruptcy filing. Genesis continues to have constructive conversations with creditors.\u201d On November 16, 2022, the company tweeted that \u201cabnormal withdrawal demands\u201d had surpassed its available liquidity, claiming the collapse of FTX as the reason for the problem. The default of 3AC negatively impacted the liquidity and duration profiles of our lending entity Genesis Global Capital. Since then, we have been de-risking the book and shoring up our liquidity profile and the quality of our collateral.\u2014 Genesis (@GenesisTrading) November 16, 2022 \u201cIn consultation with our professional financial advisors and counsel, we have taken the difficult decision to temporarily suspend redemptions and new loan originations in the lending business,\u201d the company stated. At the time, a Genesis spokeswoman stated that the company \u201chad been evaluating all viable possibilities\u201d despite the liquidity crisis brought on by the FTX announcement.\u00a0 \u201cAfter reviewing a number of options, we made the difficult decision to temporarily suspend redemptions and new loan originations in the lending business so that we can identify the best solution and outcome possible for clients,\u201d she said.\u00a0 On November 10, FTX declared bankruptcy, causing a wave of crashes and alerts throughout the cryptocurrency industry. When Genesis stopped all withdrawals, the market lending rate for the Genesis Dollar (GUS) increased by 75%, which was linked to a selloff and potential movements to short the asset. Genesis\u2019 final public comment was published on Twitter on November 16 when withdrawals were halted, and the following silence raised worries about a \u201ccrypto contagion\u201d spreading on.\u00a0 The post Genesis Trading Warns of Possible Bankruptcy appeared first on Crypto Academy.",

    "content": "Pitching a startup to investors without a personal recommendation isn\u2019t a terrible idea \u2014 as long as you\u2019ve done your research first. Tetra Insights co-founders Michael Bamberger and Panos Rigopoulos raised a $5 million Series A last year, and the duo said cold outreach was a key part of their strategy. \u201cWhen I changed my criteria to finding people who were a fit, the process was really quick,\u201d says Bamberger, who initially raised a $500K friends and family round in 2019 followed by a $1.5 million seed round a year later. Full TechCrunch+ articles are only available to members Use discount code TCPLUSROUNDUP to save 20% off a one- or two-year subscription Rigopoulos and Bamberger shared their cold-calling advice with TC+, along with the full text of one of their winning emails and a detailed breakdown of the three-step process they used. \u201cOnce you get investors, the story doesn\u2019t matter; it\u2019s all about the metrics, the numbers and the performance,\u201d Bamberger said. \u201cBefore the investment, the numbers are just part of the story, so you really have to understand how you\u2019re telling the story.\u201d Due to the Thanksgiving holiday in the U.S., we are skipping this Friday\u2019s newsletter, but we\u2019ll be back in a week with another TC+ roundup. Thanks very much for reading, and have a great week. Walter Thompson Editorial Manager, TechCrunch+ @yourprotagonist Cold outreach with a warm touch: Here\u2019s the fast pitch we emailed to investors Track and capture: Getting started with attention metrics Image Credits: DBenitostock (opens in a new window) / Getty Images Once upon a time, metrics like time on site and pages per visit were sufficient for growth marketing, but that\u2019s no longer true. To track engagement and performance, brands need to know exactly where their ads appear and whether consumers are viewing them actively or passively. \u201cViewability is no longer enough, and \u2018attention metrics\u2019 are becoming increasingly popular in the industry,\u201d according to Sylvain Le Borgne, MediaMath\u2019s head of data and analytics. \u201cAs attention metrics and measurement continue to mature, brands can learn more, develop a plan aligned with key business outcomes, start optimizing for attention, and kick-off their targeting and measurement tactics to capture consumer attention.\u201d Track and capture: Getting started with attention metrics Get your product and customer success teams on the same page to improve net retention Image Credits: Richard Drury (opens in a new window) / Getty Images You don\u2019t need to move the needle far to optimize customer success. SaaS startups that incrementally improve will stack small wins that have the potential to alter the company\u2019s trajectory. Instead of using a traditional siloed approach, founders should consider rolling their product and CX teams into a single unit to promote cohesion, writes Bryan House, SVP of product and customer success at Elastic Path. \u201cRegardless of what you call the role, product management, UX and customer success should report to the same person,\u201d he advises. \u201cThis leader should create a structure that shares incentives and common goals aligned to your customers\u2019 measures of success.\u201d Get your product and customer success teams on the same page to improve net retention A love letter to micro funds, the backbone and future of venture capital Image Credits: Getty Images Venture capital funds can reach into the billions, but smaller pools that max out at $50 million or less \u201care truly the funds that power the future of the industry,\u201d reports Rebecca Szkutak. Last year, Pitchbook recorded $147.2 billion in general venture fundraising inside the United States, with micro funds raising nearly $17 billion of that amount. \u201c[They are] often the first investment in a company, which creates more opportunity in the lifecycle,\u201d said PitchBook senior venture analyst Kyle Stanford. \u201cEspecially when we talk about how much capital has gone into the venture market, it wouldn\u2019t have been possible without the high number of micro funds.\u201d A love letter to micro funds, the backbone and future of venture capital During a recession, look to drive growth through customer retention Image Credits: MirageC (opens in a new window) / Getty Images Finding ways to reduce customer churn is the heart of any growth-through-retention strategy, but centralizing first-party data is step one, according to Vijay Sundaram, chief strategy officer at Zoho. Weaving together different signals like social media, website behavior and CRM data will help identify high-value customers and drive engagement, but \u201cfirst-party data is likely stored across multiple departments and systems, including marketing, customer advocacy, sales and support,\u201d he writes. \u201cBuilding rich customer profiles and establishing a culture of information sharing need to be core functions of customer-facing teams.\u201d During a recession, look to drive growth through customer retention TechCrunch+ roundup: Attention metrics, growth through retention, cold-calling advice by Walter Thompson originally published on TechCrunch",

    "content": "The three co-founders of alternative financing startup Pipe are stepping down from their roles as executives of the company in one of the most dramatic management shake-ups seen in the fintech startup world in some time. Miami-based Pipe said today it is on the hunt for a \u201cveteran\u201d CEO as Harry Hurst, who has been the face of the company since its 2019 inception, transitions from his role as co-CEO to vice chairman. Fellow founder and co-CEO Josh Mangel will temporarily assume the role of chief executive while Hurst leads the search and subsequent transition in leadership with the help of a global executive recruitment firm. Once a new CEO has been named, Mangel will become executive chairman of Pipe, focusing on product and strategy. CTO and co-founder Zain Allarakhia will remain on the board and serve as a senior advisor to the company. Usman Masood, currently the EVP of engineering, will take over as chief technology officer. \u201cWe are looking for someone who has significant operational experience scaling businesses, from product market fit to market leadership all the way through to rapid growth on a global scale,\u201d Hurst said. The news \u2014 shared with TechCrunch exclusively \u2014 is a bit startling considering that at its height just 18 months ago, Pipe was among the buzziest of fintechs with Hurst serving as its very public frontman. In May of 2021, the company had raised $250 million at a $2 billion valuation in a round that Hurst had described as \u201cmassively oversubscribed.\u201d Certainly, it\u2019s not the first time the founder of a company has stepped down to allow for fresh leadership. But it is highly unusual for all three co-founders to do so at once. And at this stage in a business. In an email interview, Hurst told TechCrunch that the trio has \u201calways known that the next phase of Pipe\u2019s growth would include a veteran operational leader.\u201d He said they initially started a search for a COO in the second quarter and during that process, realized that the role they were defining was actually that of a CEO who could help the company reach its \u201ctrue long-term potential.\u201d He added: \u201cWe\u2019re 0-1 builders, not at-scale operators.\u201d The co-founders remain the three largest shareholders in Pipe, according to Hurst. When asked what percentage of their shares the founders have sold or how many employees took loans from the company to fund the purchase of their own shares, he responded, \u201cAs a private company, we do not share information about anyone\u2019s personal compensation or holdings.\u201d Since its founding, the startup says that 22,000 companies have signed up for Pipe and $7 billion of ARR (annual recurring revenue) has been connected to the platform. Hurst insists that traction is not the issue here, telling TechCrunch that Pipe is on track to \u201c3x\u201d its revenue this year compared to last year. \u2018Nasdaq for revenue\u2019 When Pipe first started three years ago, its goal was to provide SaaS companies a funding alternative outside of equity or venture debt. It promoted itself as the \u201cNasdaq for revenue,\u201d touting that its mission was to give SaaS companies a way to collect their future revenues up front by pairing them with investors on a marketplace that paid a discounted rate for the annual value of those contracts. The goal of the platform was to offer companies with recurring revenue streams access to capital so they didn\u2019t dilute their ownership by accepting external capital or get forced to take out loans. Armed with $50 million in strategic growth financing from the likes of HubSpot, Okta, Slack and Shopify, Pipe announced in March 2021 that it would begin to expand beyond strictly serving SaaS companies to \u201cany company with a recurring revenue stream. That could include, Hurst had said, D2C subscription companies, ISP, streaming services or telecommunications companies. Even VC fund admin and management fees were being piped on its platform, for example, according to Hurst. In February, Pipe announced it was expanding into media and entertainment financing with the acquisition of London-based Purely Capital. With that buy \u2014 its first \u2014 Pipe created a new media and entertainment division called Pipe Entertainment with the aim of giving independent distributors the opportunity to trade their revenue streams in the same way a SaaS company could. Expanding into so many new verticals felt like a bit of a gamble to some observers. Working with SaaS companies with their boring, predictable recurring revenues felt very different than working with independent movie production companies that, as Hurst himself pointed out, sometimes had to wait \u201cthree to five years to get their money back and go on to their next projects.\u201d Hurst appeared to have so much confidence in Pipe\u2019s \u201ccapital markets engine\u201d that he believed it could support \u201cthe entire revenue-as-an-asset class\u201d globally. At the time, he told TechCrunch, \u201cEventually, anyone should be able to originate onto our platform.\u201d He remains optimistic. Currently, over 50% of the trading volume \u2014 the buying and selling of future revenues \u2014 on the platform comes from non-SaaS vertical markets. And surprisingly, Pipe Entertainment is one of the fastest growing verticals on its platform, according to Hurst. \u201cIn general, diversifying across verticals has been positive, and we plan to continue driving additional vertical expansion,\u201d he told TechCrunch. Clearly, much has changed since February as the markets took a dramatic shift. Since then valuations have been challenged, over 100,000 tech workers have been laid off and inflation has surged. Presently, Pipe has 108 employees. It has not conducted any layoffs, Hurst said. The company\u2019s latest move has nothing to do with the company\u2019s current financial situation, according to Hurst, who says that Pipe \u201cis well positioned.\u201d He added: \u201cUnlike many companies in this challenging environment, we have the resources and half a decade of runway to make long-term, strategic decisions from a position of strength to ensure we are continuing to drive further value to our customers and investors.\u201d Pipe has raised over $300 million in its lifetime from investors such as Greenspring Associates, Craft Ventures, Morgan Stanley\u2019s Counterpoint Global, CreditEase FinTech Investment Fund, Fin VC, 3L, and Japan\u2019s SBI Investment. Existing backers such as Next47, Marc Benioff, Alexis Ohanian\u2019s Seven Seven Six, MaC Ventures and Republic. Increasingly competitive landscape While revenue-based financing has been around for decades, it has become more of a pervasive way to fuel SaaS startups in recent years. Y Combinator alum Arc came out of stealth in January with $150 million in debt financing and $11 million in seed funding to build what it describes as \u201ca community of premium software companies\u201d that gives SaaS startups a way \u201cto convert future revenue into upfront capital,\u201d among other things. In August, Arc \u2014 which now describes itself as a digital bank for SaaS companies \u2014 landed another $20 million in a Series A round led by Left Lane. Spanish-American outfit Capchase \u2014 which says it turns \u201cSaaS recurring revenue into flexible growth financing\u201d \u2014 in July of 2021 secured $280 million in new debt and equity funding and has since raised $80 million in equity and taken on another $400 million in debt. Austin-based Founderpath in August announced it had secured $145 million in its own debt and equity financing to help B2B SaaS founders grow their businesses without diluting ownership. Specifically, the company claims that it allows founders to take up to 50% of their annual recurring revenue (ARR) in upfront cash. Crowdz, which secured $10 million in capital co-led by Citi and Dutch growth equity firm Global Cleantech Capital, said this year it expanded from providing invoice-based financing to SaaS-focused SMEs to also providing them with recurring revenue access to upfront capital they need without having to dilute their equity. Unlike Pipe, these companies remain focused on serving SaaS businesses. \u201cAfter our public launch in 2020, we saw a lot of follow-on players enter the space, and we understand some of them may be facing challenges,\u201d Hurst said. \u201cWhile the market has changed significantly since we started Pipe, we\u2019ve never been in a stronger position for this next phase of growth.\u201d More funding flows into Pipe, as buzzy fintech raises $250M at a $2B valuation Pipe\u2019s founding team stepping down as hunt for \u2018veteran\u2019 CEO begins by Mary Ann Azevedo originally published on TechCrunch",

Despite that, the Shiba Inu army has reached yet another milestone as the number of SHIB holders has expanded significantly. Whales keep dumping SHIB Last week, the amount of Shiba Inu owned by those wallets varied between $86 - $82 million. Now, they have continued dumping the second biggest meme coin as its price keeps declining. At the time of this writing, the top 100 whales on Ethereum hold 8,036,305,217,856 SHIB evaluated at $68,301,754.

Related Elon Musk Comments on What Truly Made FTX Fail SHIB trading volume soars by 7.5 million percent Earlier today, CoinMarketCap spread the word about the trading volume of Shiba Inu skyrocketing by 7,449,053 percent. The possible reason for this was the movement of large amounts of SHIB by whales. U.Today reported that yesterday slightly more than one trillion SHIB was moved in just several chunks. However, the meme coin remains in the lows and its price is going deeper down. At press-time, SHIB is changing hands at $0.000008633.

    "content": "ST. PAUL, Minn. -- Voters elected the most diverse slate of candidates to the state legislature ever this year, making the Capitol more reflective of the Minnesota communities lawmakers serve. \u00a0In January when session begins, there will be 35 of the 201 members in both the House and Senate who identify as people of color, according to a list from the\u00a0Minnesota Legislative Reference Library. That's a notable increase from just nine Black, Indigenous of people of color - BIPOC members - who\u00a0served in St. Paul a decade ago.The\u00a0first openly transgender lawmaker\u00a0will join the Minnesota House and the Senate will have the first Black women in its chamber in Minnesota's 164 years as a state.\"I really do believe when you have a variety of thoughts and ideas at the table that we all do better,\" said Sen. Bobby Joe Champion, DFL-Minneapolis. \"Paul Wellstone said it best, he said, 'we all do better when we all do better.'\"Champion was elected by the new Senate DFL majority to be president of the chamber next year, a key role that presides over debates on public policy. He will be the first person of color and to hold that position - just 50 years after the first Black man was elected to the Senate.\u00a0\"When we think about progress, it's important for people to see it,\" he said. \u00a0 CBS Now the legislature better represents the make-up of our state, though it still falls short of mirroring it. Data from the 2020 U.S. Census shows that nearly 24% of the state population is comprised of people of color. BIPOC members at the Capitol in January will account for 17.4% of all lawmakers. The legislature crafts policy and pass state budgets that impact Minnesotans' way of life. \u00a0\"If we want public policy to really reflect and take in consideration all of us then you have to have all of us at the table,\" Champion said.In the House, Republicans tapped another barrier-breaker to steer their caucus next year. Rep. Lisa Demuth, R-Cold Spring, is the first woman to be leader of the House GOP. She is also the first Black person to lead any of the four main legislative caucuses.\"I did not raise my name to be voted in by my caucus to break any history, or make any history,\" Demuth said. \"I actually just wanted to do the job and thought I'd be able to lead our caucus well in the next two years.\"Demuth, who was first elected in 2018, is the head of the House minority, so she'll have to work with Democrats who have control to find compromise to see any policy priorities through. She said there's room for agreement with the DFL and the political environment \"doesn't have to be a constant fight all the time.\"\u00a0\"I'm a conservative. I'm a Republican and I am proud of that. But I'm also here to served Minnesota and the things that matter to all Minnesotans shouldn't be dependent on the color of my skin or my gender at all,\" she said.Her focus is on her leadership style and qualifications, not the historic significance of her new position. She said she asked her colleagues to look past that and not simply \"check a box\" when choosing her to lead.But the impact is not lost on her.\"Why did it take this long?\" she said.",

    "description": "The official start of the holiday shopping season begins with Black Friday on Nov. 25. Here's how to get the best deals without the stress.",
    "content": "H oliday shopping season will officially begin this week with the Black Friday sales on Nov. 25. Typically the busiest shopping day of the year, the sale event has extended to become a multiple-day promotion for many retailers, extending into Cyber Monday\u2014aimed at encouraging e-commerce driven purchases\u2014and sometimes beyond. Navigating these sales for bargains and holiday gifts can be stressful, with several competing deals and offers to sort through. Meanwhile, some shoppers find that they end up with buyers\u2019 remorse when they get swept up in the hunt for deals. Read More: Why We Buy Things We Don\u2019t Need TIME spoke to shopping and personal finance experts about how to ensure that you spend wisely. They shared their advice for getting the best deals without the stress. Be realistic and budget Much of the stress around the holidays comes from the desire to match gift-giving expectations for those you care about. But especially if you have children, it\u2019s important to ensure that you don\u2019t overextend yourself. \u201cIt\u2019s really important for people to dial it back and focus on what it is that you can personally afford this year, and stay within that realm,\u201d says Trae Bodge, Smart Shopping Expert at truetrade.com. \u201cGive yourself grace,\u201d says Tori Dunlap, entrepreneur and person behind the account @herfirst100k on TikTok. Budgeting does not have to be a strict restriction, but rather a guardrail that will make sure you are shopping with purpose. \u201cIt\u2019s the permission slip, you need to spend money without feeling guilty,\u201d Dunlap says. Budgeting during the holiday season can simply be a list of who you need presents for, potential gift ideas and the amount you\u2019d like to spend on the gift. If you can see you don\u2019t have the income to purchase a gift for everyone in the family, be honest with family and friends on how things stand financially, or suggest alternatives like a Secret Santa or White Elephant, says Bodge. In order to gauge how much they should expect to spend this year, Dunlap suggests shoppers look at last year\u2019s budget and how they dealt with it. She says that thinking about whether you brought credit card debt into this year with you and considering how your financial situation has changed can help to shape how much you expect to spend in the upcoming holiday season. Shop smarter Several big retailers, like Target , Walmart and Best Buy , offer their Black Friday deals online ahead of Thanksgiving. If you are worried about not being able to purchase items due to increased online traffic and possible website crashes, you should check out deals before Black Friday. Target, for example, is offering daily and weekly deals, some of which are exclusively available online. Daily deals will occur through Dec. 24 while supplies last, the retailer said in a statement. Shoppers can also take advantage of curbside pickup on select items and locations at stores including Macy\u2019s, Kohl\u2019s and JCPenney. Same or next-day delivery is also available at certain department stores. While in-person shopping is useful for products that need to be seen first-hand, online shopping often offers a greater selection of items in terms of size or color, and makes it much easier to save. Bodge and Dunlap both recommend downloading the Paypal Honey browser extension , which finds coupons and other offers for shoppers. Honey also tracks an item\u2019s historical pricing, making it easier to see if the price of an item actually went down during Black Friday weekend. The Paypal Honey extension is also available for mobile browsers like Safari, as well as through an app. Greg Lisiewski, Vice President of PayPal Shopping told TIME that he recommends using the extension if you\u2019re just browsing online, while the app is more useful if you know exactly what you want to purchase. \u201cYou can actually put in the product name and we\u2019ll do the pricing at different merchants\u2026 instead of having to bounce around from site to site.\u201d If you do choose to order online, Bodge suggests you place your order by Dec. 14, since that\u2019s the last official day that retailers can guarantee that your order will arrive before the holidays. Make store policies work for you Holiday return policy varies from store to store, but most retailers allow shoppers to return items purchased during this time of year through January. Best Buy, for instance, is allowing customers to return any gifts purchased between Oct. 24 and Dec. 31 until Jan. 14, while Amazon is extending returns until Jan. 31 . It\u2019s also worthwhile to consider joining a retailer\u2019s free loyalty program, which grants access to exclusive discounts ahead of time. Stores also offer holiday price match guarantees, which will lower the price of an item if you find an identical item for less at a retail competitor. This can be done at time of purchase, or often after you\u2019ve bought the product\u2014typically you would need to present a proof of purchase for this. Stores like Target also match Target.com prices with in-store purchases. Although sales are already available and last through the holidays, Bodge says that shoppers can find the best deals for small home appliances, like security cameras and robotic vacuums, on Black Friday. Bargains for electronics (laptops, tablets, etc.) are strong from Black Friday through Cyber Monday. Take a beat\u2014and watch out for predatory behavior Retailers can often create a sense of urgency with doorbuster deals, or advertisements that say supply is limited. This can encourage shoppers to panic buy and overspend on things they don\u2019t need, Bodge tells TIME. \u201cSetting a budget for yourself can [also] be really helpful,\u201d Bodge says. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have yourself on your list and set a budget for yourself, you might fall into [a trap] of one [gift] for them, one for me, that causes a lot of people to go over budget.\u201d Dunlap also asks people to think strategically about how they spend their money. Responsible users should use their credit cards as the main way to purchase items to maximize the amount of points, Air Miles and other possible cashback offers for select stores. Shoppers should not, however, depend on credit cards, or online offers like Buy Now Pay Later if they won\u2019t be able to pay back what they have borrowed within a reasonable amount of time to avoid interest accruing. Dunlap also advises against acquiring store credit cards, unless shoppers genuinely purchase or spend a lot of money with those retailers. \u201cPlease be aware that a lot of these stores, when presenting their credit card to you, will call them something like a rewards card. This is not a rewards card,\u201d Dunlap says. \u201cThis is a credit card and store rewards cards tend to have higher interest rates. So if you are a person who was not able to pay off the credit cards on time and in full, a rewards card is going to hurt you.\u201d Do your research and look beyond the big retailers Customers should also look to their existing accounts to ensure they are getting the best deals. \u201cMake sure that you\u2019re aware of the offers that your credit cards might have,\u201d Bodge tells TIME. It\u2019s also worth looking into perks and offers retailers might provide to incentivize customers to choose them over their competitors even if items are priced the same, such as an additional gift card with your purchase, says Bodge. Now is also a good time to think about supporting smaller retailers while still getting a deal, and maybe even finding something more unique than you\u2019d get elsewhere. Small Business Saturday, a marketing initiative aimed at encouraging shoppers to support these sellers, falls on Nov. 26 this year. \u201cYou have more purchasing power during holidays than you do any other time of the year and small businesses, women-owned businesses\u2026[these] people need those dollars most so you can vote with your dollars every day of the year, but especially during the holiday,\u201d Dunlap tells TIME.

    "content": "The post Tron (TRX) And Apecoin (APE) Likely To Be Overtaken By Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The cryptocurrency market suffered another major blow this past week with the apparent collapse of FTX. The latest news is the CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried has stepped down, and the company has filed for bankruptcy. The wider implications will be seen in due course, but this is still a good time to invest in winning new coins. Here we look at why coins affected by the collapse, Tron (TRX) and Apecoin (APE), are likely to get overtaken by Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) as it is forecasted for 6000% growth. >>BUY ORBEON TOKENS HERE<< Tron (TRX) is a Picture of Decline Since Tron price peaked at $0.18 in April 2021, it has been declining beneath a descending resistance line. Tron also fell sharply against an ascending support line that had first appeared in March 2020. Tron is now trading above the horizontal support level of $0.055. The Tron price might drop to $0.036 if it collapses. This represents a 40% reduction from the current Tron (TRX) pricing, with the weekly RSI supporting this decline. On the other hand, a breakout from the long-term line would render this negative forecast for the price of Tron meaningless. Now, it appears improbable that this will happen, and Tron will continue to see a downward trend. ApeCoin (APE) Still Lacks a Proper Use-Case Yuga Labs, the organization that created the Bored Ape Yacht Club, launched ApeCoin (BAYC). ApeCoin garnered a lot of attention due to its connection to the largest NFT project. Many smaller investors viewed it as a way to fund BAYC projects without shelling out hundreds of thousands for an NFT. The owners of the Bored Ape and Mutant Ape collections, however, received the majority of the ApeCoin tokens. What\u2019s worse, Bored Ape holders started selling ApeCoin soon after its launch because it had no apparent use. As a result, BAYC holders profited handsomely from ApeCoin, leaving ApeCoin holders holding the bag. ApeCoin will continue to be in trouble without a distinct use case. This might alter with the full release of Yuga Labs\u2019 metaverse project Otherside. The metaverse\u2019s importance for ApeCoin could help the coin regain momentum. Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) Protects its Members A brand-new decentralized investment platform called Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) has been making waves across the crypto market. It makes it possible to invest as little as $1 in early-stage enterprises and startups. The NFTs-as-a-Service from Orbeon Protocol offers a platform for investments and aids enterprises in overcoming the challenge of fundraising. To do this, startup companies are minted and sold to investors as fractionalized NFTs which can be purchased for as low as $1. Orbeon Protocol gives investors access to the venture capital market and aids in getting early-stage companies the money they require to realize their full potential and succeed. Due to the inherent risk associated with fundraising, the platform contains a \u2018fill-or-kill\u2019 mechanism that automatically refunds investors if any fundraising project fails to reach its targets. The mechanism works on a solid proof audited smart contract. Orbeon Protocol\u2019s native coin, ORBN, has been made available in a presale phase that started at the end of October and will run until January 2023. In this short time, the price of ORBN has increased from $0.004 to $0.009 and is predicted to rise further up to $0.24 by the time the presale ends. Orbeon Protocol is like a beacon of hope in a market beset by bad news.

Using VeCarbon to achieve decarbonization Given that China is among the leading industrialized countries with high tons of carbon emissions from its various activities, it is no surprise that it is looking to adopt blockchain technology to control its climate impact. Opportunities are limitless with the use of and adoption of blockchain technologies. Related: The future: VeChain\u2019s blockchain generates same emissions generated by mining 1 single Bitcoin However, reducing carbon emissions calls for a global effort involving multiple parties, including data sharing, for greater efficiency. With blockchain, entities can build trust and increase efficiency. Furthermore, one of the most crucial parts of blockchain application is centered on carbon emission data management. China\u2019s policy for reaching key carbon reduction targets, peak carbon emissions by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2060, was recently released:https://t.co/DdTMUTN0RI Shanghai Tanlian is ready to achieve a digital low-carbon transformation through #blockchain technology. #VeChain pic.twitter.com/Ba02psqSRq \u2014 eisenreich (@eisenreich) November 22, 2022 This sector is known for its high complexity and requires multi-dimensional international cooperation. Hence, the need for the VeChain blockchain. As a result, VeChain developed VeCarbon, a blockchain-focused carbon emission data platform hosted on the VeChain Thor protocol. The VeCarbon system is specifically designed to tackle complex climate control issues. With carbon data tracking becoming a crucial part of the global climate control mechanism, China intends to leverage VeChain\u2019s innovative platform to trace and ensure transparency in carbon emissions data. As an advanced technology, VeCarbon will provide transformative solutions to reduce carbon emissions by utilizing features of the public blockchain. Hence, Shanghai Tanlian, VeChain\u2019s parent company, has expressed its readiness to ensure that a low digital carbon drive is achieved via the VeChain network. As electricity generation continues to challenge the communist state, policymakers are exploring the mass adoption of solar PV to kickstart its green energy initiative. VeChain reaches a milestone with PoA 2.0 upgrade Meanwhile, the launch of the PoA 2.0 (Proof of Authority 2.0) on the VeChain (VET) protocol signifies another historic win for the network. The PoA will usher in a new phase of sustainable growth and development for the platform with an increased adoption rate. It is worth noting that the upgrade has been a much-anticipated project which the developers completed and unveiled on November 17 at block height 13815000 after the integration of VIP-220. For the Blockchain community, this is the largest network upgrade on the VeChain mainnet since its launch. The update will facilitate several benefits for the ecosystem. Some of the benefits include quality data and improved on-chain security. The upgrade has positioned VeChain as the perfect sustainable platform for energy-friendly projects and real-world solutions. The improved network also has enhanced scalability features to improve tasks in the blockchain space. Meanwhile, the upgrade brings VeChain a step closer to realizing its goal of global adoption of its supply chain management system.

    "content": "Last month, an infamous cryptocurrency trader who got famous for getting off with over $100 million in a contentious price manipulation scheme reportedly lost millions on a similar exploit effort that failed early Tuesday. According to some data, Avraham Eisenberg, the trader responsible for the Mango Market breach in October, just recently borrowed 40 million CRV tokens through the Aave platform. This appeared to be a part of the plan to sell off the tokens, decrease the value of CRV, and profit from millions of short bets on the token, leaving Aave with bad debt as such. However, the scheme did not work out as expected. Early on Tuesday, CRV\u2019s price dropped from $0.53 to $0.41, but it rapidly recovered and soared as high as $0.71.\u00a0 Eisenberg openly described a strategy to influence Aave\u2019s lending regulations weeks before, which would have made it possible for the trader\u2019s Tuesday plot to succeed. I've been advised aave is perfectly safe so here's the potential trading strategy. Not financial or legal advice, but if you do make 9 figures on this feel free to send a tip Note that starting with more initial capital increases success odds and profit percentage pic.twitter.com/HKAF7Y5ogM\u2014 Avraham Eisenberg (@avi_eisen) October 19, 2022 However, neither Aave nor Gauntlet \u2013 the software used by Aave \u2013 moved to take any preventative measures in the weeks that followed to stop an exploit as the one Eisenberg described. Tuesday afternoon, when Eisenberg\u2019s quick plan had failed, Gauntlet released a statement to make it clear that Aave had survived the encounter mostly undamaged. The attempt to squeeze CRV on @AaveAave has been unsuccessful and unprofitable. Despite this Aave has accrued a much smaller insolvent positionOur immediate recommendation is to freeze a number of tail assets on v2 to mitigate the risks of similar, likely unprofitable, squeezes\u2014 Gauntlet (@gauntletnetwork) November 22, 2022 In response to a tweet that has since been removed, Gauntlet said that it would contribute to paying the $1.6 million loss as part of their insolvency refund program, which guarantees to pay up losses sustained by customers like Aave as a result of Gauntlet\u2019s \u201crisk parameter optimization\u201d defect.\u00a0 The plan received a mixed response from some Aave DAO members. \u201cBetter late than never, no?\u201d \u2013 one member wrote. \u201cGauntlet should have done this proposal way before that Avi pulled the trigger. What were you doing all this time while Avi was bragging about his attempt to economically exploit AAVE?\u201d\u00a0 Eisenberg stole over $100 million from Mango Markets, located in Solana, last month using an oracle price manipulation. Mango DAO decided to drop all criminal proceedings against the trader in exchange for Eisenberg returning $67 million of the stolen money to assist the firm pay down its bad debt. Eisenberg accepted the offer; the next day, he revealed himself as the trader responsible for the scheme, describing the widely perceived hack as a \u201cvery lucrative trading approach.\u201d The post Mango Market Hacker Loses Millions In Failed Aave Manipulation appeared first on Crypto Academy.",

    "content": "The post Chiliz (CHZ) And Shiba Inu (SHIB) Holders More Pessimistic As Flasko (FLSK) Goes Up appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Existing cryptocurrency marketplaces are susceptible to erratic price changes as turbulence rises. Well-known cryptocurrencies Chiliz (CHZ) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) are subject to adverse price action in 2023. However, many investors are presently enamored with new cryptocurrency initiatives like Flasko. Chiliz (CHZ) Down 71% From Its ATH\u00a0 Each blockchain-based system must have its cryptocurrency like Socios utilizes the Chiliz (CHZ) token. The objective is to change them from being apathetic observers to proactive promoters. The Chiliz (CHZ) coin combines a blockchain supporter platform with Chiliz (CHZ). No matter this unique application, Chiliz (CHZ) could not see significant increases in the last few weeks. With a current value of $0.2536, Chiliz (CHZ) has lost 71% of its previous peak value of $0.89. As a result, investors in Chiliz (CHZ) have seen some deficits. They are now considering making deposits in other cryptocurrencies like Flasko, which might produce enormous returns soon. Shiba Inu (SHIB) With No Likely Gains Incoming\u00a0 Owners of Shiba Inu (SHIB) are also losing money since the token launched alongside Dogecoin (DOGE). The second-largest joke currency, Shiba Inu (SHIB), has decreased by 7.26% over the past seven days to $0.000009026. Nevertheless, some market players think that the Shiba Inu (SHIB) price decrease is only transitory and predict that the cryptocurrency could rise soon. Although Shiba Inu (SHIB) could see a rise soon, investing in new projects with more potential for growth is much preferable.\u00a0 Flasko (FLSK) With The Most Potential\u00a0 The Flasko presale has only been on for two months, yet it has already entered phase two, and coins have been running out quickly. We can also see why Chiliz (CHZ) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) investors are so interested in it, given the innovation it provides to the equation. With the Flasko initiative, a unique alternative investment platform will be made available where customers may purchase fractionalized NFTs bolstered by genuine premium wine, vintage champagne, and lavish whiskey bottles kept in secure places worldwide. Early investors enjoy the additional benefit of receiving the real-life asset delivered for free to a location of their choice with the purchase of a complete NFT! The Flasko team has also declared that team tokens would be locked for two years and that token liquidity would be suspended for 33 years. This fact and the thorough audit performed by Solid Proof demonstrates that Flasko is among the least dangerous available investment options. From $0.015, Flasko\u2019s value has already grown, and further price increases are imminent. The price of Flasko is currently at $0.085, making this the ideal moment to invest, as it may reach $4 by March 2023!

    "content": "Smart contracts are becoming increasingly prevalent as the world moves towards a more digital and automated future. Still, they are far from being the panacea of all technological ills. Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with a predetermined set of rules. They are stored on the blockchain and run by computers, which makes them tamper-proof and reliable. However, as with any new technology, smart contracts have associated risks. This article will explore some of the most common pitfalls and how to avoid them. What Are Smart Contracts? The web offers many technical definitions for smart contracts, but we will keep it simple for this article\u2019s purpose. A smart contract is a computer protocol that executes the terms of a contract. In other words, it is a way to enforce agreements between two or more parties digitally. Think about the implications of that for a second. A smart contract could help anyone buy or sell anything of value\u2013a house, car, company shares, etc. The possibilities are endless. Before understanding the risks of smart contracts, which are the core of this post, let us look at their benefits. The Benefits of Smart Contracts As mentioned, smart contracts help to enforce agreements between multiple parties digitally. This can happen without the need for an intermediary, such as a lawyer or a notary. This allows for the execution of transactions at a fraction of the cost and time it usually takes. Furthermore, smart contracts are immutable, meaning that, usually, no one can change them once they run. This assures all parties that the contract will perform as agreed upon. Last but not least, smart contracts can help to automate many tasks. This can free up time and resources that you can spend elsewhere. Now that we know what smart contracts are and their benefits let us look at their risks. The Risks Associated with Smart Contracts While the benefits of deploying smart contracts are evident, you must consider several risks. One of the most significant risks associated with smart contracts is the lack of security audits. Given the complexity of smart contracts, they must be thoroughly tested and audited before being deployed on a blockchain. Unfortunately, this is often not the case, and many smart contracts contain vulnerabilities that malicious actors can exploit. Another risk associated with smart contracts is their complexity. Smart contracts are often very complex, making them difficult to understand and debug. This can lead to errors in the contract code, which can have devastating consequences. Finally, smart contracts are often irrevocable, meaning you generally cannot change them once they go live. This can be a problem if a contract contains errors, as there is no way to fix them. Mitigating the Risks of Smart Contracts Mitigating the risks associated with a smart contract is no easy feat. You should consider a few key things when developing or utilizing a smart contract. Below are some tips to help you avoid common pitfalls and secure your contract. Do your research: Look at what your competitors are doing and see what has worked well for them. There is no need to reinvent the wheel when it comes to security. Use a trusted development platform: Ethereum is the most popular smart contract development and utilization platform. However, other options, such as Solana, are also available. Test your code thoroughly: Be sure to test it for all possible scenarios. This includes positive and negative test cases. Keep your code simple: The more complex it is, the more likely it is to contain security vulnerabilities. Use a top smart contract audit company: Some companies offer security auditing services for smart contracts. Among these, we can mention Solidity Finance, SolidProof, PeckShield, Hacken, and OpenZeppelin. This is a critical step in ensuring the security of your contract. Do not put sensitive data on the blockchain: The data stored on the blockchain is public and accessible to anyone. As such, it is essential to avoid storing sensitive data on the blockchain. Educate yourself and stay up-to-date on best practices: The blockchain and smart contracts world constantly evolve. It is vital to keep up-to-date on the latest news and trends. By following these tips, you can help to ensure that your smart contract is secure and avoid common mistakes. However, keep in mind that no system is perfect, and there are always risks associated with any contract. It is essential to understand the risks involved before entering into any agreement. The Advantages and Disadvantages of Different Types of Smart Contracts When it comes to smart contracts, there are a few different types that you can choose from. Each class has advantages and disadvantages you must be aware of before deciding. Here is a look at the most common types of smart contracts: Centralized Smart Contracts The main advantage of centralized smart contracts is that they are much easier to develop and deploy than other types. This is because only one entity needs to be involved in the development and deployment process. Centralized smart contracts also tend to be more efficient than other smart contracts. This is because they don\u2019t have to undergo the same rigorous verification process as decentralized smart contracts. The main disadvantage of centralized smart contracts is that they are much less secure than decentralized smart contracts. Only one entity works to develop and deploy the code, increasing the risk of errors in the contract. Decentralized Smart Contracts Intuitively, the core advantage of a decentralized smart contract is that it enables trustless transactions. In other words, two parties can transact with each other without having to go through a third party or middleman. This is possible because decentralized smart contracts are immutable, as mentioned above. Having a good idea of the pitfalls of dealing with smart contracts. The so-called \u201cDAO Hack\u201d case will help us better understand the matter. The DAO hack occurred on the Ethereum blockchain in 2016. In short, a hacker managed to exploit a flaw in the code of the DAO smart contract. This trick let him siphon off about a third of the funds that the DAO had raised. This incident led to a hard fork of the Ethereum blockchain, which resulted in the Ethereum Classic (ETC) creation. This is a typical example of how things can go wrong when dealing with decentralized smart contracts. Choose the Right Type of Smart Contract Choosing the right type of smart contract is essential to the success of your project. Should you trust the higher security of a decentralized smart contract, or should you prefer to manage a centralized system? As is often the case, the correct answer depends on the scenario. For instance, a decentralized smart contract is more likely to be secure against scrutiny than a centralized one. On the other hand, a centralized system may offer more control and transparency. In any case, you must carefully consider the advantages and disadvantages of each smart contract before making a decision. You see so many centralized exchanges (or CEXs) because they offer easier onboarding and faster transaction. In general, they are more user-friendly for first-time crypto users. However, this comes at the expense of security. CEXs hold users\u2019 private keys in centralized storage (i.e., servers that criminals may hack). This makes them a bigger target for hacking than decentralized exchanges (DEXs), which don\u2019t have a single point of failure. DEXs are often seen as more advanced and therefore intimidating for new users. They can be harder to use and may have longer transaction times. However, they offer increased security because hackers do not have a central server to target. In the end, the best type of smart contract for your needs depends on the specific circumstances of your project. A decentralized smart contract may be the best option if security is paramount. However, a centralized system may be better if you need more control and transparency. In any case, remember that history has brought us many cases of unmanageable centralized systems and hackable decentralized platforms. There is no perfect solution, but with some research, you can find the best option for your project. The importance of Auditing Smart Contracts If you think auditing a smart contract is unnecessary, think again. Just because a contract runs on the blockchain doesn\u2019t mean it is infallible. Smart contracts are susceptible to the same vulnerabilities as traditional software applications. That\u2019s why you must have your contract audited by a qualified security professional before you deploy it. An audit can help you find and fix potential security issues before they cause problems. Here are some of the most common smart contract security pitfalls: Reentrancy vulnerabilities: Hackers can exploit a reentrancy vulnerability if a contract calls an external address that calls back into the first contract. This attack can drain the first contract\u2019s balance and send it to the attacker\u2019s address. Short addresses: With a short address, you might accidentally send your Ether (ETH) to a contract instead of a personal wallet. This mistake can be costly, as you will not recover your ETH if it goes into a contract. Integer overflows and underflows: If a smart contract uses a 32-bit integer, it is susceptible to an integer overflow or underflow attack. This attack can cause the contract to execute unintended code, leading to loss of funds. Unchecked send: If a contract calls the send function without checking the recipient\u2019s address, it could send ETH to a hacker. This type of attack is known as an unchecked send attack. Best practices for Writing Secure Smart Contracts The good news is that some best practices can help you write more secure smart contracts. Following these practices can help mitigate many of the common security issues. Use a Secure Language Choosing a secure programming language is the first step to writing a secure smart contract. Several languages are particularly well-suited for writing smart contracts, including Solidity, Vyper, and Bamboo. These languages let you write smart contracts, and they all include features that help to make contracts more secure. For example, Solidity includes a static type system that can help prevent some types of attacks. Use an Auditor Before deploying a smart contract, it\u2019s essential to have it audited by a professional. An auditor will look for potential security issues and help you fix them before anyone can exploit them. Use Test Networks When testing smart contracts, it\u2019s important to use a test network instead of the main network. Test networks are separate from the main network, allowing you to test contracts without putting real money at risk. Keep Your Contracts Simple The more complex a contract is, the more potential there is for errors. And, of course, errors can lead to security issues. So, if you can keep your contracts simple, you\u2019ll be more likely to avoid security problems. Use Security Tools Several tools can help you secure your smart contracts. For example, the MythX tool can help you find potential security issues in Solidity contracts. Some open-source libraries can help you add security features to your contracts. Following these best practices can help you write more secure smart contracts. However, it\u2019s important to remember that there is no such thing as a completely safe contract. Even the most well-written contract is exploitable if not correctly implemented or deployed. So, always exercise caution when working with smart contracts. Wrapping Up Smart contracts are a powerful tool, but they\u2019re not without risks. Before writing or deploying a smart contract, it\u2019s essential to be aware of the potential security pitfalls. Following some simple best practices can help ensure that your contracts are as secure as possible. Do not underestimate the role of hiring good developers for your contract. In any case, you should always do an audit from a professional to mitigate as many risks as possible. And, of course, always use caution when working with smart contracts.

When asked whether such efforts were safe for the countries involved, the developer said it depends on how these efforts are executed. \u201cThe biggest risk of being friendly is if you end up attracting the terrible people,\u201d said Buterin. \u201cIf you get a certain kind of reputation, it\u2019s very easy to accidentally attract all of the Do Kwons.\u201d Do Kwon was the founder of Terraform Labs, the primary developer behind the Terra blockchain. Terra\u2019s two primary cryptocurrencies \u2013 LUNA and UST \u2013 surged into crypto\u2019s top 20 last year, only to quickly spiral and collapse in May 2022. Kwon is now faces international investigation and the ire of investors worldwide for token holders of billions of dollars. Before the collapse, Do Kwon had amassed a large social media following and often responded rudely to his critics online. Many within the Bitcoin community even sung his praises as he to buy $10 billion in Bitcoin for Terra\u2019s stablecoin reserve. \u201cOne of the things we can do better is not have a community that\u2019s supportive of that kind of behavior,\u201d Buterin said. Though the crypto community has since distanced itself from Kwon, Bitcoiners remain highly supportive of El Salvador President Nayib Bukele.

    "content": "The post Litecoin to Repeat Historical Bull Run, LTC Price Heading Towards this Level appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The top two cryptocurrencies\u2013Bitcoin and Ethereum have almost made up for this week\u2019s losses brought on by the rumblings of the Genesis Global bankruptcy. Talking about altcoins, Litecoin has long held the third spot in terms of market capitalization and for the longest time, it has been profitable for investors. In the midst of the upheaval, an analyst believes that after a long time of bearish sentiment, Litecoin will likely resume its historical bull runs in relation to the price of Bitcoin. On the LTC/BTC ratio chart, Litecoin is currently valued at.0047 ($77.76 worth of BTC), and he predicts that it will break out of its bearish channel and rise to near .02 in early 2023. \u201cAlright, starting to believe this is the real deal for LTC/BTC. It\u2019s long overdue for a solid pump. Here\u2019s how Litecoin works \u2013 long periods of slowly bleeding down sideways, followed by a quick pump up to .02 BTC or so when everything else is bearish,\u201d he said in a tweet. Should Traders Bet on LTC? Analyst Smart Contracter also expects Litecoin\u2019s price to break out. The price breakout, according to the expert, is probably connected to Litecoin\u2019s upcoming halving event, when its programmed code will lower payouts for LTC miners, thus reducing its supply. $ltc of all coins trying to break out of a rather large accumulation of all things i wasnt expecting LTC to be the one to do things pic.twitter.com/wYzM58yT9Q\u2014 Bluntz (@SmartContracter) November 22, 2022 Recently, the crypto community has been more interested in Litecoin as its daily social engagements peaked at 99.91 million. Regardless of LTC\u2019s price direction, according to Lunar Crush, it is time for the community to start paying attention to the coin in the upcoming weeks.

This comes in the wake of a whopping 31 percent increase In just a few hours when the price of Litecoin rose from $61.6 to $81.55 on Tuesday. #Litecoin's price surge may have shocked some of you, but the large address accumulation has been the key to watch.

SBF tweeted on November 24 that he would appear in person to give a speech at the New York Times BookDeal Summit on November 30. NYT writer Andrew Ross Sorkin directs the yearly event. It looks into recent news stories about business and politics; right now, SBF is a hot issue. It would also be the FTX founder\u2019s first appearance in public since his bankruptcy filing earlier this month. I\u2019ll be speaking with @andrewrsorkin at the @dealbook summit next Wednesday (11/30). https://t.co/QocjPtCVvC\u2014 SBF (@SBF_FTX) November 23, 2022 SBF is currently located in the Bahamas, where the NYT expects he will take part in the interview.\u00a0 Reactions On November 24, Sorkin tweeted SBF\u2019s commitment to appear, along with some of his own remarks. He said, \u201cThere are many critical issues to be raised and answered, and nothing is off limits.\u201d Recently, the NYT has drawn a lot of criticism for publishing what the cryptocurrency community refers to as \u201cpuff pieces\u201d for SBF. Last week\u2019s publication was titled \u201cHow Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s Crypto Empire Collapsed.\u201d It did not mention any problems related to the FTX collapse, poor management, or fraud. Even the newly appointed CEO of Twitter, Elon Musk, left a comment on the article, asking, \u201cWhy the puff piece?\u201d\u00a0 Thought SBF speaking at NYT was absurd.But then I saw the rest of the panel. pic.twitter.com/v0pclTzysu\u2014 Trung Phan (@TrungTPhan) November 24, 2022 The crypto community is furious because it seems like the media is again bowing to SBF. Since SBF quit as CEO, he has been active on Twitter, and the new CEO is not amused. According to a report, FTX attorneys said SBF\u2019s \u201cincessant and disruptive tweeting\u201d was hurting their company efforts.\u00a0 The founder of The Daily Gwei, Anthony Sassano, questioned how he could enter the nation without being arrested. If this man is able to walk into New York City (let alone get through U.S border control) and not get arrested then I'll lose all hopeWtf is going on pic.twitter.com/n9RXKlGnGG\u2014 sassal.eth (@sassal0x) November 23, 2022 Vinny Lingham, the co-founder of Civic and Gyft, said SBF was probably not going to jail, adding: \u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong. He absolutely should. But he won\u2019t. He might get convicted, but he won\u2019t serve time. He spent your billions insuring against that.\u201d\u00a0 The post Sam Bankman-Fried To Speak At NYT BookDeal Summit appeared first on Crypto Academy.",

According to a recent Glassnode report, 172,700 bitcoins are leaving cryptocurrency exchanges on a monthly basis, which is the highest rate to date.

Ministries in Russia and the Russian Central Bank have had a negative stance on cryptocurrencies, which led to the banning of crypto payments in the country. Nonetheless, lawmakers in Russia are now working on launching a national crypto exchange. The reports come after members of the Duma parliament discussed regulating digital financial assets that would benefit Russia in the long run.\u00a0 One of the members, Sergey Altuhov, stated that Russia cannot \u201cdeny the existence of cryptocurrencies.\u201d According to him, Russia could earn billions of rubles every year only from the taxes on cryptocurrency trading. Anatoly Aksakov previously stated that a crypto exchange within the Moscow Exchange could be in the works.\u00a0 A couple of months ago, lawmakers introduced a bill that would allow people to mine cryptocurrencies and trade them in foreign markets, given that it was not allowed within Russia.\u00a0 It\u2019s yet unknown whether any of the crypto bills will be approved by the Duma. Nonetheless, lawmakers\u2019 activity suggests that crypto adoption in Russia could happen, despite the previous stance on cryptocurrencies of Russian officials. The war between Russia and Ukraine led many countries to put sanctions on Russia. The latter experienced economic drawbacks as a result, rightfully so. Nevertheless, Russia sees the existence of a national crypto exchange as a method to increase budget revenues. While some see it as negative for the world, many view this recent bill as a good thing for the crypto market. Some even suggest that decisions like this may help the crypto market recover.

    "content": "The Noel Diary Interview: Justin Hartley & Charles Shyer on the HolidaysComingSoon Editor-in-Chief Tyler Treese spoke with actor Justin Hartley and director Charles Shyer about The Noel Diary. The two discussed holiday movies and the original novel the film is based on. The Noel Diary is now available for streaming through Netflix.\u201cWhen a best-selling author returns home at Christmas to settle his mother\u2019s estate, he finds a diary that holds secrets to the past,\u201d reads the film\u2019s synopsis.\ufeffTyler Treese: Justin, there\u2019s such a rich history when it comes to Christmas movies and Netflix does such a great job of putting out some fun ones each year. So what was most exciting about being part of this cinematic tradition with The Noel Diary?Justin Hartley: For me, it was the players involved \u2014 Charles, and then the script as well. I thought the script was really great and I thought the character had a place to go that was difficult to get to and quite a journey from beginning to end. For those reasons, it was an easy decision for me. Those are all the things that you look for, or at least all the things that I look for. It checked all the boxes. So for me, I can\u2019t wait. Let\u2019s do it.Charles, the book was so successful. What really stood out about that original novel that made you want to adapt it, write the screenplay, and then direct it?Charles Shyer: To be honest with you, I didn\u2019t really read the novel from start to finish. There was a script that somebody else had written based on the novel that I read, and I thought, \u201cI know how to make this the kind of movie I want to make.\u201d So I didn\u2019t feel it was necessary to go back. I knew the novel was successful, but it was a very serious approach. I skimmed it, but I didn\u2019t go page by page. So I knew how to make it my own, and I told Netflix what I would do with it, and I had a lot of ideas and they went for it.Tyler Treese: Justin, you know, this story goes throughout the whole emotional gamut. Your character\u2019s dealing with grief, forgiveness, and opening up. You talked about the script really grabbing you. What did you find most interesting about Jake\u2019s journey here?Justin Hartley: I really loved, when I read it, the idea that \u2026 when I take on a job and I get intimidated by the journey that the character goes on, that\u2019s when I get motivated. I get giddy and I get anxious to do the part. When you feel like \u201cthat\u2019s a lot, this is a really well-written character, a really great script, and I hope I can deliver,\u201d that\u2019s when the juices start flowing. It\u2019s almost like an athlete. You almost want that challenge, and this movie absolutely had that. So I love the fact that he goes on this journey \u2014 for several reasons, actually, and it\u2019s difficult. It\u2019s not easy. It\u2019s hard and he might not get what he wants. That, to me, was what sealed the deal.Charles, there\u2019s a really great scene in the film featuring It\u2019s a Wonderful Life. Is that your favorite Christmas movieCharles Shyer: Yeah, I would say it is. That\u2019s the scene that we came up with that wasn\u2019t in the book or in the other script. I wanted to pay homage to that movie, to [ director Frank] Capra. I like the idea that they were the only ones left watching the movie at the end with the dog. I just like the whole concept. It was paying homage to Capra, really. That\u2019s what I wanted to do. And that Barrett (Doss) says it\u2019s the best movie she\u2019s ever seen. I love that.The post The Noel Diary Interview: Justin Hartley & Charles Shyer on the Holidays appeared first on ComingSoon.net.",

Developers at the Ethereum foundation talked on Thursday and decided on eight proposals to explore for Shanghai, the next upgrade after moving to proof-of-stake. The Shanghai hard fork included unlocking staked Ether (ETH) and allowing stakers to withdraw their assets.\u00a0 As reported, a multiclient devnet was released on Wednesday to trial staked validator ETH withdrawals. Developers already agreed to push forward with building staked ETH withdrawals before Thursday\u2019s meeting, tweets from Marius Van Der Wijden hinted on Wednesday. EIP 4844 was among the eight Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIP) agreed on. The EIP centers around better scaling by leveraging proto-danksharding technology. Ideally, this tech will boost network throughput and slash transaction fees. Proto-danksharding sections a blockchain into \u201cshards\u201d to achieve this.\u00a0 Five EIPs focus on upgrading Ethereum Virtual Machine, the staging area where smart contract codes are deployed. The EVM proposals include EIP 3540, EIP 3670, EIP 4200, EIP 4570, and EIP 5450.\u00a0 When Shanghai on Ethereum? Indeed, developers reached consensus on eight EIPs to build for the Shanghai hard fork. Not all eight EIPs might ship with the final upgrade expected in the second half of 2023. Also, ETH coders did not finalize a timeline for staked Ether withdrawals.\u00a0",

    "description": "Iran arrested Voria Ghafouri on Thursday over his criticism of the regime, as mass protests cast a shadow over the squad's World Cup ambitions.",
    "content": "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates \u2014 Iran arrested a prominent former member of its national soccer team on Thursday over his criticism of the government as authorities grapple with nationwide protests that have cast a shadow over its competition at the World Cup. The semiofficial Fars and Tasnim news agencies reported that Voria Ghafouri was arrested for \u201cinsulting the national soccer team and propagandizing against the government.\u201d Ghafouri, who was not chosen to go to the World Cup, has been an outspoken critic of Iranian authorities throughout his career. He objected to a longstanding ban on women spectators at men\u2019s soccer matches as well as Iran\u2019s confrontational foreign policy, which has led to crippling Western sanctions. [time-brightcove not-tgx=\u201dtrue\u201d] Read More: Iran\u2019s World Cup Team Remained Silent During Their National Anthem More recently, he expressed sympathy for the family of a 22-year-old woman whose death while in the custody of Iran\u2019s morality police ignited the latest protests. In recent days he also called for an end to a violent crackdown on protests in Iran\u2019s western Kurdistan region. The reports of his arrest came ahead of Friday\u2019s World Cup match between Iran and Wales. At Iran\u2019s opening match, a 6-2 loss to England, the members of the Iranian national team declined to sing along to their national anthem and some fans expressed support for the protests. The protests were ignited by the Sept. 16 death of Mahsa Amini, a Kurdish woman arrested by the morality police in the capital, Tehran. They rapidly escalated into nationwide demonstrations calling for the overthrow of the Islamic Republic. The western Kurdish region of the country, where both Amini and Ghafouri are from, has been the epicenter of the protests. Shops were closed in the region on Thursday following calls for a general strike. Iranian officials have not said whether Ghafouri\u2019s activism was a factor in not choosing him for the national team. He plays for the Khuzestan Foolad team in the southwestern city of Ahvaz. The protests show no sign of waning, and mark one of the biggest challenges to Iran\u2019s ruling clerics since the 1979 Islamic Revolution that brought them to power. Rights groups say security forces have used unleashed live ammunition and bird shot on the protesters, as well as beating and arresting them, with much of the violence captured on video. At least 442 protesters have been killed and more than 18,000 detained since the start of the unrest, according to Human Rights Activists in Iran, a group that has been monitoring the protests. The U.N. Human Rights Council voted Thursday to condemn the crackdown and to create an independent fact-finding mission to investigate alleged abuses, particularly those committed against women and children. Read More: Iran Has a Long History of Protest and Activism Authorities have blamed the unrest on hostile foreign powers, without providing evidence, and say separatists and other armed groups have attacked security forces. Human Rights Activists in Iran says at least 57 security personnel have been killed, while state media have reported a higher toll. The protesters say they are fed up after decades of social and political repression, including a strict dress code imposed on women. Young women have played a leading role in the protests, stripping off the mandatory Islamic headscarf to express their rejection of clerical rule. Some Iranians are actively rooting against their own team at the World Cup, associating it with rulers they view as violent and corrupt. Others insist the national team, which includes players who have spoken out on social media in solidarity with the protests, represents the country\u2019s people. The team\u2019s star forward, Sardar Azmoun, who has been vocal about the protests online, was on the bench during the opening match. In addition to Ghafouri, two other former soccer stars have been arrested for expressing support for the protests. Read More: Weary and Thirsty, World Cup Fans Try to Find Joy at a Complicated Tournament Other Iranian athletes have also been drawn into the struggle. Iranian rock climber Elnaz Rekabi competed without wearing the mandatory headscarf at an international competition in South Korea in October, a move widely seen as expressing support for the protests. She received a hero\u2019s welcome from protesters upon returning to Iran, even as she told state media the move was \u201cunintentional\u201d in an interview that may have been given under duress. Earlier this month, Iran\u2019s football federation threatened to punish players on its beach soccer team after it defeated Brazil at an international competition in Dubai. One of the players had celebrated after scoring a goal by mimicking a female protester cutting off her hair.",

    "content": "It is with a very strong bullish move that T bulls break through the $0.0209 resistance level. But the bullish momentum reduces as it encounters a strong resistance at $0.021 and then the price pulls back briefly. The bullish price, however, continues to take up new levels until the price hits a brick wall at $0.0216 the bull market triggers massive selling pressure, but with the new support which is forming at $0.021, buyers attempt to cut short the bearish move, but they eventually failed. According to the RSI line, the momentum of the market continues to range at around 37. After the bulls were able to dam the falling price, they now seek for support price level with which they will reclaim their ground in the market. buyers and sellers are engaged in a serious tug-of-war at the moment, but it seems like the support level still continues to hold strongly at $0.0207. From here, the buyers are trying to expand the narrow price channel by pushing back the resistance level.",

    "content": "The post Bitcoin Ignites New Decline, Could Soon Fall Below $16,000! appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto markets have turned extremely volatile and uncertain ever since the popular exchange FTX collapsed and created a ripple of fallouts. Meanwhile, Bitcoin and popular altcoins attempted to begin with a recovery phase, but the bears perceived the fact of their growing dominance despite minor bounces. Therefore, bearish clouds continue to hover over the Bitcoin (BTC) price which may drag the price back below $16,000 in a net couple of hours! This is Why Bitcoin(BTC) Price May Resume its Downtrend! Bitcoin price was struggling hard to clear the resistance at $17,000 compelled the price to form a double top pattern, As a result, the rejection surfaced, diving the prices lower close to $16,400 at the moment which may be extended below $16,000 very soon.\u00a0 The BTC price broke down from the rising wedge which is largely considered bearish and heading towards the lower support close to $16,300. Meanwhile, if a flip occurs above these levels, then the bulls may regain dominance and uplift the price above $16,500 which appears unlikely presently.\u00a0 However, the mounted bearish sentiments and pressure are likely to drive the prices lower while the bulls may fail to hold the pivotal $16,000, hitting the levels around $15,850.\u00a0 Where Will the Bitcoin form its Bottoms? Bitcoin price ever since began to drop off its 2022 highs, has been maintaining a pattern of being rejected at certain levels. As per a popular analyst, Moustache, BTC price has been constantly rejected at the Mayer multiple lines. Hence after the recent rejection, it was proven that the price may continue to dive towards the south, testing the lower support levels.\u00a0 pic.twitter.com/LlEF0ZEAUs\u2014 \ud835\udd44\ud835\udd60\ud835\udd66\ud835\udd64\ud835\udd65\ud835\udd52\ud835\udd54\u24d7\ud835\udd56 (@el_crypto_prof) November 24, 2022 Hence, the analyst believes that the Bitcoin (BTC) price may continue to plunge hard and reclaim the levels lower to the current support zones. Meanwhile, the bulls may also try hard to hold the price but if extreme bearish pressure mounts, the buying volume may not compensate which may propel the price lower in the next 12 to 16 hours.\u00a0",

    "content": "The post What Investors Need To Know About Why This Crypto Winter Is Distinct? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Lots of new money flooded into the cryptocurrency market in 2021, just in time for the first \u201ccrypto winter.\u201d Investors have found that this crypto winter is hitting them harder than previous ones. Experts say that this is because a lot of new investors got into the market last year, along with a complex mix of unrealistic expectations and the market\u2019s expected volatility. The present \u201ccrypto winter,\u201d according to experts, may endure for quite some time. Read on to find out what that implies for your investment portfolio. In Other Words, What Exactly Is A Crypto Winter? According to Piers Ridyard, CEO of RDX Works in Switzerland, the bear market in previous cryptocurrencies is known as \u201ccrypto winter.\u201d A bear market, he explains, is not the same thing as a crypto winter. A bear market occurs when prices fall, while a crypto winter describes a period of inactivity. Ridyard says that an investor would get nothing back during a crypto winter and would lose money during a bear market. Even though the market has made up some of its deficits over the past few months, many individuals may have seen their portfolio returns remain flat or even fall short of expectations. You should also keep in mind that crypto winters, like bear markets in the stock market, are pretty much a permanent part of the cryptocurrency market. The Experts Explain Why This Crypto Winter Is Different The consensus among industry professionals is that we are currently experiencing a \u201ccrypto winter\u201d and that buyers should brace themselves for periods of stagnant or even declining market value. Further, he claims that people\u2019s frustration stems from their inability to grasp the situation. Ways For Surviving Crypto Winter What you can do to weather a crypto winter is similar to what you would do to weather a stock market decline. While waiting for the economy to rebound or in preparation for the next crypto winter, experts recommend these steps for crypto investors. Diversify Investments Cole argues that those looking to invest in cryptocurrencies should prioritise portfolio diversity. Take This Time To Get Back To Basics The expert believes that the crypto winter is an excellent time for investors to catch their breath and learn about the latest developments in the cryptocurrency sectors, such as the-ekrona.com. So, now is a wonderful moment to study the techniques and principles that drive the cryptographic sector. Do Some Research\u00a0 To ensure that you are putting your money into crypto initiatives with lasting worth or practicality, it is recommended that you conduct your own due diligence. Since they are the most popular and well-known, most experts advise sticking with Bitcoin and Ethereum. In Conclusion As we know, cryptocurrencies are highly volatile, and there is some risk regarding investment. Another expert, Dr. Johnson, warns that cryptocurrency investing is a high-risk endeavour for the vast majority of people. For this reason, you should only invest funds in the cryptocurrency market that you can afford to lose. Disclaimer: This is a guest post.

    "content": "Disney+/Getty Images/Ringer illustration The second Marvel Studios Special Presentation, after \u2018Werewolf by Night,\u2019 solidifies the format as the MCU\u2019s Swiss army knife The Guardians of the Galaxy are back for another adventure. Except this time, they\u2019re not saving the galaxy from the threat of a Kree renegade wielding an Infinity Stone, or a godlike Celestial, or a genocidal purple alien with some bold plans to combat overpopulation issues. No, this time, the Guardians are here to save Christmas. And the only way to do that involves kidnapping Kevin Bacon. This is the delightfully absurd premise behind The Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special, which premiered on Disney+ on Friday. With the glaring exception of Gamora, the entire Guardians gang returns for the occasion, along with the addition of Cosmo the Spacedog (voiced by Maria Bakalova) and a version of Groot who is now alarmingly swole. Written and directed by James Gunn, the 42-minute TV special marks the first time the MCU\u2019s motliest crew has appeared together under Gunn\u2019s direction since 2017\u2019s Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2. (Since then, Gunn was fired and rehired by Marvel Studios; during his exile from Marvel, he began his work at DC Films, and last month he was named co-chair and co-CEO of DC Studios, making him responsible for guiding the DCEU into a new era.) It\u2019s also the last time the Guardians will appear on screen before Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3, which will serve as the conclusion to Gunn\u2019s Guardians trilogy when it\u2019s released in May 2023. The holiday special was filmed concurrently with Vol. 3, and while it\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess as to what the future holds for the Guardians after that, the special provided an additional opportunity for Gunn and the rest of the Guardians team to have some fun before concluding the trilogy\u2019s arc. \u201cVol. 3 is actually a pretty emotional movie, it\u2019s heavy in a lot of ways,\u201d Gunn tells The Ringer. \u201cWe still have all of the fun of the Guardians, but with a serious story. And just making a film is a little more painstaking\u2014you gotta get all the shots exactly right. Whereas [the holiday special], to us, was a blast. It was almost like our days off. Every few days we would shoot Vol. 3, and then every few days we\u2019d shoot this. It was a lot of fun to shoot and make in general. It\u2019s just so goofy and so not serious, it made the stakes much lower when we were doing it.\u201d Although the TV special\u2019s reveal that Mantis and Peter Quill are related comes as something of a shock, it doesn\u2019t feature any Earth-shattering developments that will change the entire course of Vol. 3 or the MCU at large. Instead, it offers a light-hearted, low-stakes side quest that features some potentially crucial character and relationship developments, while also helping to make the case for Marvel\u2019s new streaming format. The Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special is just the second entry in Marvel Studios\u2019 Special Presentations series, following the release of Werewolf by Night in October. In early 2021, Marvel made the transition to producing TV at the start of Phase 4 with WandaVision, and these Special Presentations represent the studio\u2019s latest attempt to diversify its programming as it releases content faster than ever. As self-contained stories that have run between 40 and 53 minutes, they\u2019re like souped-up versions of Marvel One-Shots, a series of short films that were released from 2011 to 2014 as bonus features for MCU movies and allowed filmmakers to both fill in narrative gaps and experiment with characters and concepts. The Special Presentations now provide an even bigger canvas for new characters and ideas to be introduced to the MCU, as well as the chance to focus on otherwise secondary characters, while not necessarily having to worry about the same narrative and financial stakes that come with big-budget theatrical releases or six-to-nine-episode series. In the Guardians Holiday Special, this all translates to the chance to watch Drax and Mantis return to Earth to visit the Hollywood Walk of Fame, party, and most importantly, abduct Kevin Bacon in frightening fashion. \u201cDrax the Destroyer and Mantis have been really background characters for quite a few movies now,\u201d Gunn says. \u201cBeing able to give them an opportunity to take center stage, in all of their anarchic glory, was one of the things that excited me about telling this story. And we didn\u2019t have the pressure of making a multi-hundred-million-dollar movie starring Drax and Mantis. We were able to do it in TV, where it\u2019s contained.\u201d Before Drax and Mantis stole Kevin Bacon\u2019s Christmas, Werewolf by Night teased the potential of the Special Presentations format when it landed on Disney+ ahead of Halloween. Directed by Oscar-winning composer Michael Giacchino, Werewolf by Night is an entertaining homage to the monster movies of the 1930s and 1940s, one fittingly styled in black and white with an admirable commitment to the charming cheesiness of that film era. If it weren\u2019t for the direct reference to the Avengers in its narrated introduction, it wouldn\u2019t have been easy to tell that the TV special belonged in the MCU. It features and focuses entirely on new characters from lesser-known Marvel properties, like Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal\u2019s Jack Russell, who hails from the special\u2019s 1970s namesake comics series. And while some of the characters and monsters who appear in the special may end up being important to the future of the MCU (especially as the debut of an all-new Blade approaches), Werewolf by Night works well as a stand-alone project, largely because it feels like such a stylistic departure from the Marvel norms. Unlike Werewolf by Night, though, the Guardians Holiday Special doesn\u2019t exist in what feels like its own corner of the MCU. Rather, it\u2019s an extension of a story that\u2019s more than a decade in the making, with the Guardians having previously appeared in a pair of stand-alone films, along with Infinity War and Endgame, plus a collective cameo in this year\u2019s Thor: Love and Thunder. This context provided a unique opportunity for Gunn and Co. to create a self-contained story, while also laying down some narrative foundations for the next movie to build on. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of stuff that we\u2019re Trojan horsing into Guardians Vol. 3 by way of the Christmas special,\u201d Gunn explains. \u201c[Peter and Mantis\u2019s] relationship, but also the fact that they bought Knowhere from the Collector\u2014this is where they live, this is their headquarters. The fact that they have a telekinetic dog, who is a big part of the landscape of Knowhere; the way in which Nebula has taken on much more of a leadership role in the group; how Kraglin is a very important part of the team. We get to see all of these things in the Christmas special that then are sort of taken for granted by the time we get to Vol. 3, and I don\u2019t have to spend a lot of time at the beginning of the movie explaining them.\u201d Marvel Studios has yet to officially announce any plans to develop more Special Presentations, and it isn\u2019t clear whether additional projects would continue to be limited to movie-adjacent releases and holiday themes. But the Guardians Holiday Special and Werewolf by Night have both showcased the framework\u2019s potential in different ways, and it may prove to be a promising narrative space in which filmmakers can enjoy extra creative freedom, and secondary characters can get a chance to shine without having an entire Disney+ series dedicated to them. The MCU\u2019s Phase 5 is expected to kick off on February 17 with Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, but you never know; maybe we\u2019ll get the surprise gift of another Special Presentation with Wong: A Love Story by Valentine\u2019s Day.",

    "content": "The post Is the Binance SAFU Fund Safe? Willy Woo Raises Concerns appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Following the FTX and Alameda implosion, Willy Woo \u2013 a famous Bitcoin on-chain analyst \u2013 has raised concerns over the Binance insurance fund. According to Woo, Binance\u2019s use of BNB coin as part of the crypto insurance fund is much more like FTX using FTT tokens for the same purpose. Hereby raising concerns over the 1,230,769 BNB ( ~$367 million) included in the Binance insurance fund. Woo calls out the Binance cryptocurrency exchange for using BNB in its insurance fund instead of including more Bitcoins. Notably, Binance\u2019s SAFU insurance fund has allocated approximately 24 percent \u2013 worth around $276 million \u2013 to the Bitcoin market. Nonetheless, Binance Smart Chain proponents have argued that BSC has more intrinsic value than FTX cryptocurrency exchange. Furthermore, according to data from DeFillama, BSC has approximately $5.59 in TVL with 502 decentralised application protocols. Closer Look at Binance SAFU Fund Centralized cryptocurrency exchanges are fighting to retain traders as more flee towards DEXs like Uniswap and PancakeSwap. Moreover, the FTX fallout has significantly shattered crypto traders\u2019 confidence in CEXs. Given the circumstances, centralized cryptocurrency exchanges are publishing their proof-of-reserves with the support of on-chain data. Mind you; blockchain data has the characteristic of being incorruptible. Binance, the largest crypto exchange by daily traded volume, has led in CEX transparency. The company established its Secure Asset Fund for Users (SAFU) in 2018 to protect users\u2019 funds. Over the years, the company has gained regulatory trust for protecting customers\u2019 funds and reporting bad actors to law enforcement. As a result, the company takes pride in over 120 million registered users.\u00a0 Notably, the crypto market houses around 300 million global users. Side Notes\u00a0 The Binance ecosystem has outperformed most crypto projects following the FTX fallout. According to our latest crypto price oracles, BNB exchanged hands at around $299, up 11.5 percent in the past seven days. With a market capitalization of approximately $48,765,145,681, the BNB market reported a 24-hour trading volume of around $903 million. Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) has continued to advocate for transparency and security in the blockchain industry. Following the FTX collapse, Binance topped its SAFU fund to $1 billion. To adjust to recent price fluctuations, #Binance has topped up the #SAFU insurance fund to $1 billion USD equivalent again.BUSD AND BNB address about 700m: https://t.co/OMoB6HeR6rBTC address 300m: https://t.co/6kOJ1MZhMMTransparency. 1/2\u2014 CZ Binance (@cz_binance) November 9, 2022 Nonetheless, the urgent and persistent question is whether Binance should have BNB coins on its SAFU fund. From my perspective, Binance should not use BNB as part of the insurance fund. However, this element is arguable and depends on your crypto interaction.",

    "content": "Crowds returned to malls and Michigan Avenue on Black Friday, hunting for something that often seemed elusive: deals to make up for the inflation that has made everyday life more expensive this year. Though shoppers filled stores Friday, many said they were disappointed not to find more eye-popping savings, especially given how pricey groceries, gas and other essentials have been in recent months. Others said they were there mostly for the experience, and are doing much of their holiday shopping online this year, taking advantage of deals offered throughout the fall and winter, rather than just on Black Friday. Advertisement Experts expect this shopping season will be a big one, with holiday retail spending in November and December projected to grow 6% to 8% \u2015 well above the average for the last decade, according to the National Retail Federation. But now, shoppers are increasingly looking for deals earlier, with Black Friday representing the halfway point of the shopping season rather than the kickoff, according to the federation. Many shoppers are also looking for discounts online. On Black Friday alone, consumers spent $7.28 billion as of 5 p.m., according to Adobe. This Black Friday was expected to set a record for online sales for the day, Adobe said. Advertisement People walk past stores in the 500 block of North Michigan Avenue in Chicago on Nov. 25, 2022. (John J. Kim / Chicago Tribune) In Chicago, online shopping may have helped taper out early morning crowds at Water Tower Place. The mall was nearly empty until 11 a.m. For shoppers like Derek and Stacey Suvlette, that was a good thing. While they said they are primarily scouting out deals online, the Indianapolis couple wanted to take their 7-year-old daughter Scout for the experience of in-person shopping in the city during their visit. Stacey Suvlette said they normally avoid the stores because of crowds. The first stop for the family was the Lego store for Scout, who was carrying a bag of purchases. \u201cThis is what she wanted to do today,\u201d Stacey Suvlette said. She said she planned to jump on her computer and check for more deals, mainly \u201cChristmas surprises\u201d for her daughter, once she returned to their hotel. Jackie and Justin Perun, from Naples, Florida, brought their two young children out for similar reasons, wanting to give them the holiday shopping experience. Jackie Perun said it was their first year doing it as a family of four. She admitted that some of the joy and excitement of Black Friday has simmered down over the years due to the convenience of online shopping, which she does too. The pre-sales make Christmas shopping easier, she said. They\u2019ve been looking out for a blue flatbed truck her oldest, whom she calls a \u201cbig truck guy.\u201d \u201cI feel like stores, in general, have been doing such a great job with pre-sales,\u201d she said. \u201cBut other than that, if we see things here that catch our eye, we\u2019ll go for it because stores have different sales in store versus online. It\u2019s hard because with little ones, you just don\u2019t want to disappoint.\u201d Anne DiCanio, 26, of Elmhurst, and her family also went shopping Friday at Woodfield Mall in Schaumburg, mostly for the experience, following a yearslong tradition for their family. Advertisement They met there at 6 a.m. but they didn\u2019t expect to find any doorbusters. People take a shopping break at Woodfield Mall in Schaumburg on Nov. 25, 2022. (Michael Blackshire / Chicago Tribune) Rather \u201cthe earlier we come, the more time we get to spend together,\u201d said DiCanio\u2019s aunt, Janeen Kroll, 49, of Chicago\u2019s Dunning neighborhood. The tradition is so important to them, that in 2020, early in the pandemic, the group gathered at Kroll\u2019s house to shop online together. \u201cIf all of us don\u2019t leave with Christmas gifts today, I don\u2019t think any of us would be upset,\u201d said DiCanio as the group took a lunch break in the food court. Natay Wilfinger, 27, of Crystal Lake, also said this year\u2019s Black Friday was a more mellow for her family than in years past when they would head to stores at 4 a.m. to get freebies and doorbusters. This year, they got to Woodfield around 8:30 a.m. \u201cI don\u2019t miss waking up, I\u2019ll tell you that,\u201d said her brother Quade Wilfinger, 24, of McHenry, as he stood outside a store Friday, taking a break from shopping. Advertisement Now, the \u201cdeals go so long,\u201d said his aunt Karin Dietz, 57, of Cary. Some shoppers, including Brandy Lorenzo, 43, of Huntley, combined online and in-person shopping Friday. While she waited in line for a boba tea for her 12-year-old daughter at Woodfield, she bought shoes on her phone. In Victoria\u2019s Secret, she ordered an item online that she couldn\u2019t find in the store. \u201cI thought it was convenient,\u201d Lorenzo said. Black Friday shoppers wait in line at Oak Brook Center on Nov. 25, 2022. (Michael Blackshire / Chicago Tribune) Some shoppers, however, say they miss the days of racing to the mall to grab predawn deals and steep one-day discounts, especially as they grapple with inflation. Though the pace of inflation has been slowing, consumer prices were up 7.7% in October when compared with the same time last year, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. At Water Tower Place, Colette Williams remembered the early wake-up times to catch doorbuster deals. This year, Williams and her relatives were surprised to find that stores were opening later and the deals weren\u2019t as competitive as they once were. \u201cI remember standing in line at 5 in the morning at Best Buy because there was some video game my kids wanted,\u201d Williams said. \u201cMy husband would get coffee for us, and we would trade off. But there\u2019s not any of that.\u201d Advertisement Some consumers say they\u2019ve adjusted their gifting plans this year, given inflation and the lack of doorbusters. . Advertisement \u201cIt\u2019s tough,\u201d said Dawn Morris, 55, of Belvidere, as she shopped with her daughter, son-in-law and 5-year-old granddaughter at Woodfield. Usually, \u201cwe go all out on Christmas gifts. This year we cut back majorly.\u201d She was disappointed not to find any great deals or doorbusters Friday, despite beginning her shopping before dawn. Brianna Hunter, 24, of Lake in the Hills, said she and her family have also felt the pinch in recent months. \u201cWe\u2019re budgeting more, especially with food prices,\u201d she said. She said she\u2019s trying to focus on quality over quantity when holiday shopping this year, buying fewer items, but making sure they\u2019re nice ones. Hunter, her sister and mother scored a few holiday gifts at Woodfield but still felt some sticker shock at the prices. \u201cImagine how much it would be if it weren\u2019t Black Friday,\u201d said her mother Sheila Hunter, 54, of some of their purchases. While doorbusters may be of the past, Lizzy Paton said Black Friday is still a big day for her 13-year-old Abi, who has been saving up for a pair of Golden Goose sneakers. Advertisement Paton and her two daughters and mother started their day early down at State Street and eventually came to Water Tower Place to make the main purchase. \u201cWe love the holidays, and we want to make the most of it,\u201d she said. \u201cBlack Friday shopping is always part of that.\u201d In recent years, Paton said she\u2019s noticed fewer stores and shoppers at Water Tower Place. This year, she also was surprised to find stores opening much later. They were lounging at a seating area in the mall, waiting for Golden Goose to open at 10 a.m. She said with pre-sales, her daughter could have bought the shoes much earlier. \u201cIt\u2019s a big deal for her to buy them herself, so we just didn\u2019t want to buy them online,\u201d Paton said. lschencker@chicagotribune.com Advertisement joanderson@chicagotribune.com",

    "description": "The Artemis I mission deployed ten CubeSat's as part of its mission, but only four appear to be operational. The post What Happened to those CubeSats that were Launched with Artemis I? appeared first on Universe Today.",
    "content": "NASA made history on November 16th when the Artemis I mission took off from Launch Complex 39B at Cape Canaveral, Florida, on its way to the Moon. This uncrewed mission is testing the capabilities of the Space Launch System (SLS) and Orion spacecraft in preparation for the long-awaited return to the Moon in 2025 (the Artemis III mission). Rather than astronauts, this mission carries a group of mannequins with sensors and has a primary payload consisting of the Callisto technology demonstrator (a human-machine video interface system). As a secondary payload, Artemis I also brought ten 6U CubeSats beyond Low Earth Orbit (LEO), three of which were NASA missions designed to perform experiments. The rest were built by partner space agencies, commercial space entities, research institutes, and universities to carry out a variety of unique deep-space science experiments. While all these satellites managed to deploy successfully, six have not made contact with controllers on the ground or since experienced problems, and their whereabouts remain unknown. The three NASA missions include the BioSentinel, which was designed, built, and tested by engineers at NASA\u2019s Ames and will measure the effects of deep-space radiation on DNA using yeast organisms. The second is the Lunar Flashflight, a technology demonstrator developed at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) with support from the Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC), the Goddard Space Flight Center, and the Georgia Institute of Technology. Its purpose is to look for surface water ice in the permanently-shadowed regions near the lunar south pole and test out new spacecraft technologies. The third is the NEA Scout mission developed by the NASA Marshal Space Flight Center in partnership with NASA JPL, with support from NASA Goddard, the Johnson Space Center, and the Langley Research Center. The purpose of the mission is twofold: one, to demonstrate solar sail deployment; and two, to demonstrate solar sail navigation by rendezvousing (and characterizing) the near-earth asteroid (NEA) 2020 GE. The other missions include the following: ArgoMoon: Contributed by the European Space Agency (ESA) and ArgoTec, an Italian aerospace company. This CubeSat aims to observe the SLS interim cryogenic propulsion stage with advanced optics and software imaging systems.CuSP: Contributed by the Southwest Research Institute (SwRI), this satellite is a \u201cspace weather\u201d mission that will measure solar particles and magnetic fields.EQUULEUS: This satellite was developed by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) and the University of Tokyo to image Earth\u2019s plasmasphere and study Earth\u2019s radiation environment from the Earth-Moon L2 point.Lunar IceCube: Developed by Morehead State University, this CubeSat will search for lunar water and other volatiles using an infrared spectrometer.LunaH-Map: This satellite, contributed by Arizona State University, will use neutron spectrometers to create higher-fidelity maps of near-surface hydrogen in permanently-shadowed craters and other regions near the lunar South Pole.Linux: Developed by Lockheed Martin, this mission will conduct advanced infrared imaging of the lunar surface.OMOTENASHI: Developed by JAXA, this lunar lander (the smallest ever deployed) will study the lunar environment.Team Miles: Developed by Florida-based aerospace company Miles Space, this demonstrator will test plasma thrusters and compete in NASA\u2019s Deep Space Derby Centennial Challenge (formerly the Cube Quest Challenge). NASA\u2019s Lunar Flashlight CubeSat undergoing tests at a Georgia Tech clean room. Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech. All ten CubeSats successfully deployed from the Interim Cryogenic Propulsion Stage (ICPS), an adapter attached to the SLS\u2019s upper stage. On November 18th, NASA officials confirmed that ArgoMoon, Biosentinel, Equuleus, LunaH-Map, and OMOTENASHI were all operational, though OMOTENASHI began experiencing problems since then. On November 24th, NASA reported that the NEA Scout mission still hadn\u2019t made contact. This prompted the mission controllers to deploy the CubeSat\u2019s sail ahead of schedule, hoping it will be visible to ground-based telescopes. In short, only four satellites were deployed and successfully established communications with their controllers back on Earth. The teams behind the remaining six missions are currently troubleshooting various solutions and are waiting to learn more. But as time has taught us, such is the nature of CubeSat missions, which are inherently high-risk and high-reward. And it may be premature at this point to count out all the missions that have experienced problems.

    "content": "The post Black Swan Author Reveals The Real Reason Behind Catastrophic Crypto Crisis appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Nassim Taleb \u2013 an award-winning philosopher \u2013 has called out the cryptocurrency market again following the FTX implosion. The famous author thinks Bitcoin is a tumor and can soon present investors with an unprecedented deleveraging scenario. Moreover, Taleb has indicated no significant cash flow in the cryptocurrency market. As such, the former options trader and risk analyst thinks the crypto market is in a liquidity crisis. Notably, a liquidity crisis is described as a financial situation characterized by a lack of cash at hand across many financial institutions simultaneously. Furthermore, most crypto companies \u2013 including Binance exchange \u2013 use their native tokens for insurance funds. The trend has been questioned as irrational since most crypto projects either pre-mined their tokens or control the largest hash power. Through a series of tweets, Taleb indicated that blockchain technology has not flourished to generate significant cash flow, particularly during bear markets. Instead, Taleb thinks that the cash circulating in the cryptocurrency industry is from other crypto projects. 2) The point is that the blockchain, in spite of all the hype, has not managed to produce anything directly useful to produce cash flow. The income is circular, from crypto-to-crypto, with some suckers in between.\u2014 Nassim Nicholas Taleb (@nntaleb) November 24, 2022 The decline in crypto cash flow can be attributed mainly to the FTX fallout and the DCG\u2019s impending implosion. Furthermore, millions of crypto traders and investors were stranded by the FTX collapse, with the investigations taking slower than anticipated. Closer Look at Crypto Market Outlook\u00a0 According to the latest crypto price oracles, the total cryptocurrency market capitalization stands at around $868 billion. Additionally, the total reported crypto trading volume in the past 24 hours stands at approximately $44.7 billion. The huge difference indicates that most crypto assets are used for speculative purposes and have been stored for later use. As such, most cryptocurrency community continues to disregard Taleb\u2019s opinions. Furthermore, speculation is part of the grey area that the cryptocurrency market thrives on. One of Taleb\u2019s opinion comments argues that the Bitcoin market should be compared to the Gold and oil industry that all have different intrinsic values. Moreover, the Bitcoin industry has significantly opened up locked-up economies. Does gold have cash flow? Or oil? It seems utility of the asset should be considered.Granted, most cryptos are useless ponzis, but they aren't inherently useless/without value.If they make the storing or transfer of money (especially in the 3rd world) easier, they have value.\u2014 THE INVESTOR'S GATE (@Investors_Gate) November 25, 2022 According to tech billionaire Elon Musk, Bitcoin will thrive long-term, but the ongoing bear market will last long. The reduced cash flow highlighted by Taleb is a culmination of the past major on-chain activities. Furthermore, global confidence in the cryptocurrency market has significantly been shaken. Nonetheless, every cryptocurrency trader must conduct proper research and form personal opinions before purchasing or investing in the digital asset economy.",

    "content": "EY\u2019s global blockchain leader says that for the first time ever, crypto\u2019s price swings do not have that big of an impact on the long-term growth of the industry. Nonetheless, he stressed: \u201cIt is also important that regulators crack down on obvious Ponzi schemes faster and with more severity.\u201d EY\u2019s Brody on Crypto Winter Paul Brody, global blockchain leader at EY, discussed the crypto winter, the need for regulation, and the collapse of crypto exchange FTX in an interview published by the Mint publication Thursday. He was asked whether he expects the current crypto winter to be over soon. \u201cThis is a much milder crypto winter than the last one,\u201d he replied. \u201cOne of the major features of this winter is that there is a decoupling going on between the price of crypto assets and product and engineering development work that is going on in the crypto industry.\u201d The EY executive opined: For the first time ever, price ups and downs don\u2019t have that big of an impact on the long-term growth of the industry. We are slowly moving away from the pure financial focus of the industry. He added that the Ethereum ecosystem is now much more focused on application development, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). Brody on FTX Collapse and the Need for Crypto Regulation The EY executive also discussed the collapse of crypto exchange FTX, which some have compared to Ponzi schemes, including the infamous one run by Bernie Madoff. Responding to a question about whether users can trust crypto exchanges following the FTX meltdown, he cautioned: \u201cThe idea behind crypto was that it is fully transparent since it is on the blockchain and you can see if something bad happened. That was a flawed theory. Seeing data doesn\u2019t mean you can understand the complex data flow in smart contracts.\u201d \u201cEntities that have tried to blend on-chain and off-chain financial transactions without robust regulatory oversight are the ones that are not doing well,\u201d Brody continued. \u201cIt\u2019s been impossible to know if your assets are strictly being held and used for you, or if they are being pledged and used in other scenarios,\u201d the EY blockchain leader warned. \u201cThe key takeaway is that your governance has to be either simple enough for people to follow or you can take a rigorously audited and publicly traded approach.\u201d He also emphasized the need for stricter regulation, stating: It is also important that regulators crack down on obvious Ponzi schemes faster and with more severity. I would like to see more regulatory activity and rules that good players can follow. Following the meltdown of FTX, many people have called on regulators in various jurisdictions to tighten their oversight. Bank of England Deputy Governor for Financial Stability Sir Jon Cunliffe stressed this week that the FTX collapse has highlighted the urgent need for tighter regulation. The White House and several U.S. senators have called for proper crypto oversight. A U.S. lawmaker recently urged the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to take decisive action to regulate the crypto industry. What do you think about the comments by EY\u2019s executive?

On Friday, AMC released three separate motion posters to its official Twitter account for the Immortal Universe (including Interview With the Vampire) with each poster hinting at the mysterious and supernatural goings on within the crumbling old Southern mansion.The first poster asked, \"Have you heard of the old Mayfair house...\" and featured some sort of shadowy figure passing behind the stained glass of the doors. The second told fans to \"feel the darkness. Feel the light\" and featured a shadowy figure turning out the light and the third warned that \"the witching hour is almost upon us\" before a flock of birds fly directly at the viewer. You can check them out for yourself below. Have you heard of the old Mayfair house...? #MayfairWitches pic.twitter.com/F8aOlcqR9O-- Interview with the Vampire (@Immortal_AMC) November 25, 2022 Feel the darkness.

As she grapples with her newfound powers, she must contend with a sinister presence that has haunted her family for generations. Written by Esta Spalding and Michelle Ashford, the series also stars Harry Hamlin, Annabeth Gish, Tongayi Chirisa, Beth Grant, Jen Richards, and Jack Huston.\"The first season starts where the book starts, in that mood of New Orleans and the sort of ghost story of this house,\" showrunner Esta Spalding previously said about the series. \"We meet really quickly Rowan Fielding who's the main character of the first book and through the series.\"She continued, \"The middle section is about 300 or 400 pages of 13 generations of witches going all the way back to Scotland. We used a piece of that, and then we feel like we're gonna save some of that great story and saga of all the different generations for later seasons, should we be so lucky.\"How is the series influenced by Rice's novel, The Witching Hour?Speaking with ComicBook.com at New York Comic Con about the upcoming series, Jack Huston and Harry Hamlin both spoke about how the series is in influenced by Rice's novel rather than a direct adaptation.\"I downloaded it. I saw that it was 56 hours long and I thought, do I have 56 hours, you know, and I listened to nine hours, and I realized that really what we have here is an interpretive show,\" Hamlin said about how he prepared for the series. \"The characters are not exactly the same as they are in the book. The story's not exactly same. They've taken the whole ethos of the witches and The Witching Hour, the first book, and they. have compiled it into what is a really wonderful, engaging television show. It's not a book. It's a TV show.\"When asked about the network's plans to adapt the other two books in the series, Lasher and Taltos, Huston said that the thinks there are indeed plans but also noted that not everything can go from page to screen, especially with books as rich as Rice's{replyCount}comments\"I think there's plans and question it's all gonna depend on you know, people's response to it. I think we've done something really daring. I think something very cool,\" Huston said. \"As Harry was saying, you know, the books themselves are dense. You know, brilliant, sort of like a literary feat, but you know, you can't put all of that in right TV series, but you can be inspired by it. You can be influenced and inspired in many ways. So, you know, I there's definitely plans, you know, in our first season finishes at the same point as The Witching Hour.\"Anne Rice's Mayfair Witches is set to debut on Sunday, January 8th on both AMC, and AMC+.",

    "content": "Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba exploded onto the scene earlier this year with the anime's take on the Entertainment District arc, and now fans are being reminded of just how much of a terror the villain Daki was with some scary good cosplay! It might be hard to remember given just how strong the Fall 2022 anime schedule is bringing an end to the year overall, but 2022 kicked off with the huge adaptation of the Entertainment Distict arc from Koyoharu Gotoge's original manga. It was here that Tanjiro Kamado faced off against their toughest demons yet, with the biggest battles in the anime to date. The Entertainment District arc introduced Tanjiro and the others (and fans) to the first real member of Muzan's Upper Rank demonic forces, and this brother and sister duo nearly killed each of the fan favorite characters. It was a much deadlier battle than anything fans have gotten to see in the anime so far, and Daki managed to carve a huge page with fans as one of the coolest villains of the year overall. Now artist @shaoows on Instagram has brought Daki to life with some perfectly creepy cosplay! Check it out: View this post on Instagram A post shared by Shaoows (@shaoows) What is Coming in Demon Slayer Season 3? Demon Slayer ended its second season with the confirmation that a third season of the series is now in the works. While the third season of the anime has yet to reveal a release window or concrete date for its new slate of episodes, the series has confirmed it will be adapting the Swordsmith Village arc of Koyoharu Gotoge's manga with its new season. Things are only going to get tougher for Tanjiro and the others from here on out.

    "content": "Since the original Avatar was rated PG-13 way back in 2009, it shouldn't be too surprising to viewers that the highly anticipated sequel has earned the same distinction, there is one major different however. Confirmed this week by the Motion Picture Association was the reveal that Avatar: The Way of Water is officially rated PG-13 for the following reasons: \"Sequences of strong violence and intense action, partial nudity and some strong language.\" Though the film seems to share a lot of visual similarities to the first one, the original Avatar's rating was for \"intense epic battle sequences and warfare, sensuality, language and some smoking.\" Thank goodness they cut out the smoking for the sequel.With just a few weeks to go before the release of the highly anticipated movie, the sequel is cutting it close to being ready for theaters. Franchise producer and James Cameron's producing Partner Jon Landau took to social media to confirm that the movie completed post-production just this week. Accompanying a photo of the post-production team on the movie, he wrote: \"Congratulations to the entire Avatar: The Way of Water family. Yesterday we completed our final mix and picture mastering and I snapped this picture of our post finishing team. I am thankful to every one of you for your contributions to the film.\"When will Avatar 2 stream on Disney+?Like so many other movies, the timeline for when Avatar: The Way of Water will stream on Disney+ depends entirely on the box office success of the sequel. Though there's a certain line of thought about interest in a sequel to the first movie since there's a 13 year gap between the two movies. Recent reports revealed that early tracking on the sequel pointed toward an opening weekend well over $100 million, plus the film has been confirmed to premiere in China meaning huge box office returns are nearly a guarantee.The shortest possible window for Avatar 2 arriving on streaming is 45 days, potentially putting the movie on Disney+ in early February. Considering the potential box office that it could bring in however, the movie may not be available for streaming for months afterward since returns could still be very high. As of this writing we just don't know. In any event, director James Cameron remains as confident in his product as ever. Speaking in a previous interview with GQ, Cameron opened up about an argument he had about the first film, telling an executive at the time:\"I said something I've never said to anybody else in the business,\" Cameron began. \"'I think this movie is going to make all the f-cking money. And when it does, it's going to be too late for you to love the film. The time for you to love the movie is today. So I'm not asking you to say something that you don't feel, but just know that I will always know that no matter how complimentary you are about the movie in the future when it makes all the money.'\"{replyCount}commentsHe continued, \"And that's exactly what I said, in caps, 'ALL THE MONEY,' not some of the money, all the f-cking money. I said, 'You can't come back to me and compliment the film or chum along and say, \"Look what we did together.\" You won't be able to do that.' At that point, that particular studio executive flipped out and went bug sh-t on me. And I told him to get the f-ck out of my office. And that's where it was left.\"Avatar: The Way of Water will be released in theaters on December 16th.",

    "content": "A new Nintendo Switch eShop sale that went live for Black Friday and that is live until December 5 discounts one of the best trilogies in gaming to the lowest price it's ever been on the eShop. For whatever reason, we got a plethora of great trilogies during the seventh generation of console gaming, aka during the Nintendo Wii, PS3, and Xbox 360 generation, which was a longer generation than normal due to the global recession that happened during it. During this generation, gamers were gifted with BioShock and its two sequels. That's right, the game in question is BioShock: The Collection. Thanks to the Black Friday Nintendo eShop sale, Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch Lite, and Nintendo Switch OLED users can play all three BioShock games for $9.99. This is a savings of 80 percent, as 2K Games usually requires $49.99 for the trio of classics. \"Experience the unforgettable worlds and monumental stories of the award-winning BioShock series with BioShock: The Collection,\" reads an official elevator pitch of the collection. Journey to the cities of Rapture and Columbia across BioShock Remastered, BioShock 2 Remastered, and BioShock Infinite: The Complete Edition, including all single-player add-on content. Fight for your life and outsmart your enemies, be it deep beneath the waves or high above the clouds.{replyCount}commentsFor those that don't know: BioShock debuted back in 2007 via 2K Boston, which would later go on to become Irrational Games. Created by Kevin Levine, the first-person shooter meets action-adventure game debuted with a 96 on Metacritic, making it one of the highest-rated games of all time. Three years later a sequel, BioShock 2, was released but by a different studio and a different director. Consequently, it wasn't as good, earning an 88 on Metacritic, which is still a great score but it's widely viewed as not as good as the other games in the series. Speaking of the other game in the series, the third and final installment, BioShock Infinite, hit another three years later in 2013. For this one, 2K Boston and Kevin Levine returned. The game earned a 94 on Metacritic.",

Also, price action has continued to move higher towards a more elevated resistance price level. To this effect, let\u2019s further examine this market. Lucky Block V1\u2019s Price: $0.0001633 LBLOCK V1\u2019s Market Capitalization: $6.65 million Lucky Block V1\u2019s Flowing Supply: 40.77 billion Lucky Block V1\u2019s Total Supply: 99.6 billion LBLOCK\u2019s Ranking on Coinmarketcap: #4835 Resistance: $0.0001633, $0.0001653, $0.0001680 Substance: $0.0001613, $0.0001590, $0.0001565 Recent price candles on the four hour market formed above the Exponential Moving Average curve. This price activity is revealing that LBLOCK V1 has more upside potential at this point.

Another technical Indicator called the MACD keeps indicating positivity about upside price movement in this market.

Coming to an hourly market, we can see that the current price stays above the Exponential Moving Average curve. Also, the latest price candle stays bullish and has kept price above the Exponential Moving Average curve. Furthermore, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence indicator seems to have recovered its upward direction. By implication, Lucky Block price action is revealing that buyers are exerting more pressure at their end of the market.

Furthermore, there hasn\u2019t been any attempt to break the resistance upward. However, at this point, it\u2019s like price action is making another attempt to move back upwards. Let\u2019s zoom in for a closer look. UNUS SED LEO value now: $3.91 UNUS SED LEO market cap: $ 3.97 billion LEO moving supply: 953.95 million LEO Total Supply: 985.24 million UNUS SED LEO Coinmarketcap ranking: #18 Resistance: $3.91, $3.95, $4.00 Support: $3.88, $3.85, $3.80 The daily reveals is trying to mount a defense against downward force. This attempt could be seen via the latest green price candlestick on this chart. Also, this event can be seen happening near a strong support of approximately $3.80. However, on the contrary, the RSI indicator seems to still maintain a different opinion about the price of this current market activity. The Stochastic RSI indicator curves have just delivered a bearish crossover, above Level 50. And, this generally portrays that a downward trend may follow in subsequent sessions. Nevertheless, should buying activities continue to increase, technical indicators like this RSI too will adjust to portray it? The UNUS SED LEO/USDT four hours chart Further reveals the struggles that are ongoing between buyers and sellers in this market. Buyers have been able to push the price higher than the sellers have pulled it down. This is seen via the last four price candles on this chart. Consequently, at this point, we can see that buyers are still having the upper hand. Also, the RSI is now moving upwards from the oversold region towards level 20 of the Indicator. Consequently, this reveals that price activities are still weak, and buyers need to exert some more pressure if the price must rise significantly toward the $4.20 price level.

    "content": "Late last year, Kevin Stone received a call asking if he could create a statue of a huge goat with Elon Musk riding a rocket as its head. Metal artist Mr. Stone in British Columbia, Canada, believed the caller was Elon Musk. Mr. Stone, who is frequently commissioned to create metal eagles and dragons, remarked, \u201cI mean, who else would want anything so crazy?\u201d A couple of cryptocurrency business owners made the request. In order to promote their cryptocurrency, the Elon GOAT, Mr. Musk was persuaded to tweet about the sculpture to his more than 118 million followers. According to co-founder of Elon GOAT Ashley Sansalone, \u201cElon tweeting us would validate the token.\u201d It is the most recent publicity gimmick in the cryptocurrency industry, where memes and jokes regarding virtual currencies frequently take over social media. But it\u2019s uncommon to use a 12,000-pound sculpture as a marketing ploy. Elon GOAT\u2019s founders claim that their admiration for Mr. Musk served as the inspiration for the name of their cryptocurrency. They believe he is a \u201cGOAT,\u201d or the \u201cgreatest of all time,\u201d along with his other admirers. They created a sculpture of Mr. Musk\u2019s head on a goat\u2019s body while he was wearing a gold-plated dogecoin necklace for $600,000. The rocket can move and point upward as though it were about to ascend. Flames can erupt out the back thanks to the gas pipes that run through it. The sculpture will be delivered on Saturday to the offices of Tesla Inc. in Austin, Texas, with the expectation that Elon Musk would show up and collect it. The occasion is being dubbed \u201cGOATSgiving\u201d by its organizers. An inquiry for comment from Tesla received no response. Mr. Musk hasn\u2019t acknowledged his resemblance to a four-legged creature or contacted the creators of the token. One of them, Mr. Sansalone, claimed that he runs a construction business and trades energy in addition to working full-time on the token. The Elon GOAT token is not a well-known cryptocurrency, in contrast to bitcoin, ether, or dogecoin. According to CoinMarketCap, it is rated far outside of the top cryptocurrencies by market value. The sculpture\u2019s concept came together last year. Mr. Sansalone, 40, added, \u201cIt was an evening joke that just kind of came to completion.\u201d Mr. Stone created Mr. Musk\u2019s head, which took him close to six months to finish. According to Mr. Sansalone, other people in Phoenix created the goat body and rocket to expedite the process. The components were then assembled and fastened to the back of a semi-truck trailer that was 70 feet long. DeMarco Hill, 51, who resides in Goodyear, Arizona, saw the statue for the first time in September and remarked, \u201cWhen I first saw the statue my jaw dropped,\u201d His 12-year-old son was taken by him, and they began to follow. You had never seen anything like it before, she said. Mr. Sansalone was approached by Mr. Hill, a trucker and owner of Stay Ready Trucking, who found the stunt to be so funny that he asked if he might take part. Only someone with a specific license could go past the towering mound of metal, according to Mr. Sansalone, who claimed Mr. Hill was required. Later, he transported the sculpture to Texas by driving it via California, Arizona, and Washington. Passing motorists beeped their horns or gave the thumbs up. He complained, \u201cIf I pull up to the side of the road, it\u2019s like people are swarming around.\u201d It becomes crazy. Denise McKinney witnessed it pass by last month while purchasing lunch from a taco truck on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles. The 43-year-old author remarked, \u201cMy initial thought was like, \u2018What the heck is this?'\u201d The face was then recognized by her. She reportedly muttered to herself, \u201cUgh, of course Elon Musk is on it.\u201d Mr. Sansalone says that most reactions to the sculpture have been positive. No one has reported mistaking Mr. Musk for someone else, according to him. Mr. Sansalone thinks that the world\u2019s richest man, Elon Musk, who recently acquired Twitter Inc. for $44 billion, is \u201carguably the most relevant person on the planet right now. During Tesla\u2019s artificial intelligence conference in September, the sculpture was displayed in front of the company\u2019s Palo Alto, California, headquarters. At that time Tesla employees crossed the street to take pictures with the artwork. Judging some tweets he posted while at the conference, it seems Mr. Musk was there, and Mr. Sansalone suspects the billionaire noticed the sculpture. He claimed that all that was visible was a lit-up rocket set up in the center of the street. Elon GOAT has been publicizing the Saturday event and tweeting at Mr. Musk for the past month in an effort to give him enough time to travel to Austin, according to Mr. Sansalone. When a flight-tracking service revealed that Mr. Musk\u2019s plane was on its way to Austin on Wednesday, they were encouraged. On Saturday in the late afternoon, they want to deliver the sculpture to Tesla\u2019s corporate offices. It is hoped that Mr. Musk will publicly acknowledge it. Mr. Sansalone claimed he has just one plan in the event that Mr. Musk doesn\u2019t: \u201cGo home and cry.\u201d",

    "content": "Large portions of the cryptocurrency community are now in a state of starvation and sorrow as a result of the FTX crypto exchange\u2019s unexpected billions dollar collapse. Poor retail investors are suffering. Flagship exchanges are in danger of going bankrupt. Critics of crypto are ecstatic. Institutional interest and support seems to be having dealt a major blow, which is the exact contrary to the optimism it had all around it before. Many smaller firms have completely stopped operations in the expectation that people\u2019s focus will ultimately shift. According to Samantha Yap, CEO of cryptocurrency PR agency Yap Global, Another PR professional who worked on a number of significant Defi projects but who wished to remain unnamed for the sake of candor stated it more succinctly: His current only concern is extracting as much money as he can from the industry before it finally collapses. \u201c \u2013 he said. However, if you pay closer attention, you can discern signs of life in this beaten-up elderly dog, such as: an effort was made to generate $1.5 billion for Matrixport; a brand-new $100 million \u201cinstitutional clientele\u201d fund; a private market centered on ApeCoin NFTs. The Japanese central bank is sponsoring some sort of central bank digital money. Alternatively, is crypto slouching toward a new, improved form of itself that can (allegedly) endure future crises or are these really the last, hateful emissions of a dying creature? Kristian Srenson, a serious Danish man who thinks the FTX scandal provides a perfect opportunity for cryptocurrency to break free from its dark past and embrace the warm and rational light of regulatory compliance, is one individual who would answer \u201cyes\u201d with a definite and passionate \u201cyes.\u201d The FTX aftermath has been somewhat advantageous for Srenson, who manages the data analytics company Tokenizer as well as a PR platform concentrating in regulated clients. Since we mostly interact with these regulated players, he explained to me, \u201cmost have tried to profit from the situation.\u201d This is an excellent opportunity to describe what we actually accomplish and how it differs from the more speculative aspects of the industry. According to Srenson, the relative laxity of crypto regulation was the primary contributor to the current catastrophe. He claimed that many businesses run without licenses, and that those that do were carelessly granted without the subsequent and essential auditing. In contrast to get-rich-quick desires, he claimed that the increased scrutiny from authorities today \u201cwould help advance the more healthy side of the industry.\u201d Cover your ears, cypherpunks and Silk Road drug dealers! Srenson\u2019s vision for cryptocurrency is for the \u201cuse cases\u201d to be severely restricted while the underlying technology is used in safe, responsible contexts, for enterprise-blockchain era things like crowdsourcing and verification. Farmy, a cryptocurrency-based online grocery in Switzerland, is one initiative that Srenson finds particularly exciting. He exclaimed, Srenson is not the only person calling for greater caution in the cryptosphere. It feels like almost every new crypto product launch that is being offered right now is a response to FTX in some way. There are several press releases emphasizing regulations, guardrails, strict policies against gambling with billions of dollars in customer funds, and responsible \u201cwe would never do that\u201d pitches. Others are more trustworthy than others. the extensive Chinese exchange sent out one news release Huobi announces an ambitious plan to \u201chelp Huobi return to the top three exchanges in the world,\u201d noting puzzlingly that \u201ctechnology drives development and technology for good\u201d\u2014never mind that the project is led by one of cryptoland\u2019s least savory figures, \u201cHis Excellency and Plenipotentiary\u201d Justin Sun of the pointless TRON blockchain. Not just exchanges and firms close to exchanges are seeking a fresh start. The lunacy of November has enabled Alexandra Fanning, a publicist who has worked with crypto artists, to better pursue her goal of she said. On the other opposite end of the spectrum are those who think that FTX was, if anything, the result of excessive deference to conventional wisdom. Among them is Cindy Leow, the creator of the decentralized exchange Nexus, which, according to Leow, has witnessed a sharp increase in users since the meltdown. Leow stated, \u201cSo many people can\u2019t access their crypto anyplace else outside of Nexus.\u201d People are saying, \u201cI\u2019m logged out of Binance for some reason,\u201d and \u201cNexus is the only place I can trade,\u201d so I have to trade there. According to Leow, the crash is evidence that centralized, mainstream exchanges are still too young to be trusted with people\u2019s hard-earned life savings and that regulation will always only provide a thin layer of protection and respectability. She does, however, think that people ought to be able to experience that \u201cspeculative thrill without jeopardizing the security of their money. Users control their own keys, but Nexus \u201clooks and feels like a centralized exchange,\u201d according to the speaker. In this manner, it will be their own damn fault if and when they inevitably lose all of their money. And crypto benefits from that.",

    "content": "My flight from Los Angeles to New York took a little more than five hours, and I brought three suitcases full of my belongings with me.Pauline Villegas/Insider I moved from Los Angeles to New York City at 22 years old after graduating college. Since this was my first time relocating out of state, I learned a lot about how to pack for cross-country moves.\u00a0 I regret not packing simple money-savers like an umbrella, and I'm glad I brought my water bottle.\u00a0 At 22 years old, I moved from Los Angeles to New York by plane. The journey took nine hours, and I squeezed as many of my belongings as I could into three suitcases.After college, I moved from my hometown of Los Angeles to New York City.Pauline Villegas/InsiderThe summer after I graduated from the University of Southern California, I decided to move from my hometown of Los Angeles to New York City. I filled three suitcases and a carry-on with clothes, shoes, toiletries, and personal items.\u00a0Overall, I think I did a decent job packing for the move, but there are some things I would have done differently. Since this was my first out-of-state move, I had no idea what to expect and was shocked by how necessary some items proved to be.I learned a lot throughout the process, especially the importance of organized, thoughtful packing.Here are four items I regret leaving behind and four I'm glad I brought with me on my cross-country move from Los Angeles to New York.\u00a0\u00a0But there were some possessions I regret not bringing with me. I wish I had packed more decorative pieces, like posters and photos, to brighten up the stark white walls in my new apartment.The little artwork I did bring with me can't be hung up yet.Pauline Villegas/InsiderSince the space I had in my suitcases was limited, decorative pieces were the last thing on my mind while packing. I knew I'd ship some pieces from my Los Angeles apartment later, but I wish I had tried to fit some posters and decor items in my carry-on bag.\u00a0\u00a0When I got to New York, unpacking and settling in was a huge relief. But the move didn't have a satisfying end since my walls and furniture were bare for so long. The little decor I did bring couldn't be hung up immediately since I still had to buy more artwork and frames.If I could do it again, I would prioritize packing decorative pieces from my previous room in LA.I was also annoyed that I didn't bring my umbrella after being forced to buy one during one of New York's summer rains.My umbrella didn't make the cut by the time I packed the rest of my necessities.Pauline Villegas/InsiderWhile packing for the move, my umbrella was the last thing in my suitcase and the first thing I took out. After weighing my bags, I realized I had to shed a few items, and my umbrella didn't make the cut.\u00a0After I landed in New York in late August, a summer storm set in, and I was forced to purchase a $20 umbrella from my local Target.Since umbrellas don't take up too much space in a suitcase, I suggest bringing one on a cross-country move to avoid wasting money on a repurchase.In Los Angeles, I used foldable closet organizers from Ikea to make the most of my apartment's limited drawer space, but I regrettably forgot to bring them to New York.When I started unpacking, I realized I left my drawer and closet organizers back in Los Angeles.Pauline Villegas/InsiderI used containers and dividers from Ikea in my college dorm to organize my drawer space, and I kept most of those organizers all four years and stored them for safekeeping.\u00a0Since New York is known for its limited closet space, I purchased an Ikea bed with drawers. I'm thankful for the extra space, but I wish I had remembered to bring the drawer organizers I used in the past.\u00a0When I unpacked all my t-shirts, pants, and sweaters, I realized I didn't leave room for underclothes anywhere. I find closet organizers bring order to an otherwise stressful process, and they are something I'm going to repurchase soon.When I got to New York, I had to repurchase all the expensive hair products I could have brought from home, which cost me over $200.Repurchasing all my hair products ended up being a huge expense on top of normal moving costs.Pauline Villegas/InsiderI figured saving space in my checked baggage was essential for my cross-country move. But there are certain beauty products I wish I had packed in my suitcase for money-saving purposes.Having to buy all new hair products, along with other toiletries, was a much higher cost than I expected. Between Target and CVS, I spent over $200 buying all the new hair products and accessories I had left home.If I could do it again, I would have found space for these items in my checked baggage.\u00a0Though I left some essential items behind, I also appreciated some things I brought with me more than I expected. For instance, given New York's grime, I'm grateful I brought the house shoes I almost tossed.My old Birkenstocks ended up being the perfect house shoes for my NYC apartment.Pauline Villegas/InsiderBefore I left Los Angeles, I donated clothes and shoes to lighten the load. I almost got rid of my old Birkenstock sandals, but I decided to keep them for indoor wear at the last minute.After the move, I was so grateful to have house shoes to change into after long days of walking around New York. I learned quickly that the last thing you want to track into your apartment is the city's dirt and grime.I'm so glad I stuck my water bottle in my carry-on, especially since it was the only thing I had to drink out of when I moved into my apartment.Bringing my reusable water bottle on the plane gave me more time to find glassware I actually liked for my new place.Pauline Villegas/InsiderEven though I planned on buying all new glassware once I got to New York, packing my water bottle proved to be a game changer.When I travel, I like to bring a reusable water bottle, so fitting the bottle in my carry-on came as second nature while packing for the move.\u00a0When I arrived in NYC in August, it was hot and humid, so drinking water on the go was essential. Since my roommates and I had limited glassware in our first couple of weeks, my water bottle became a staple both inside and outside of my apartment.Fitting my tote bags in my suitcases was the right move since they became a convenient style necessity that I underestimated while packing.My tote bags and other purses are much easier to store than I expected.Pauline Villegas/InsiderRegarding packing my suitcase, bags like totes and fanny packs weren't a massive priority. But they didn't take up much room, so I tossed a couple in there.In the first weeks of my move, I realized how valuable a tote bag or fanny pack could be in a city like New York. I use these bags nearly every day to go shopping at the grocery store or carry things during a long walk. Apart from being functional, I also find them to be stylish.Though it may have gone against conventional wisdom and weighed down my carry-on, fitting my journals and books in my suitcase was worth the hassle.My journals and books eased the transition from my hometown to the Big Apple.Pauline Villegas/InsiderI was very selective while packing my carry-on bag because of its smaller size. But certain books and journals were nonnegotiable for me, no matter how much space they took up.\u00a0As an avid writer and note-taker, my journal proved to be a saving grace in the hustle and bustle of the big move. Taking time to journal and read throughout all the chaos was the best thing for my mental health, and I'm glad I was able to prioritize these items in the packing process.\u00a0I learned that, during a big move, it's just as essential to make space for the things that will bring you peace of mind as it is to save space \u2014 or maybe more.Read the original article on Insider",

    "description": "TIME recently spoke with XPO's billionaire chairman Brad Jacobs, about supply chains and why he's looking for his next takeover",
    "content": "(To receive weekly emails of conversations with the world\u2019s top CEOs and business decisionmakers, click here.) Serial deal maker Brad Jacobs looks forward to a looming U.S. recession while he hunts for another takeover. \u201cIt\u2019s a good time to do my next big thing,\u2019\u2019 the 66-year-old billionaire explains. \u201cA downturn creates buying opportunities for acquirers with capital like me.\u201d Jacobs has done more than 500 takeovers during his long career, typically by swallowing smaller players in fragmented markets. He stepped down this fall as chief executive of XPO Logistics, the transportation giant he built through aggressive acquisitions and organic growth. [time-brightcove not-tgx=\u201dtrue\u201d] He remains executive chairman of the Greenwich, Conn., company, focused on its less-than-truckload freight operation following the Nov. 1 spinoff of XPO\u2019s freight brokerage into a separate, publicly traded entity called RXO. The executive says he can now spend most of his time pursuing a fresh target\u2014perhaps a financial services, healthcare, homebuilding, or special-purpose acquisition company. (SPACs buy businesses and effectively take them public.) Jacobs also founded or co-founded four companies in the oil, waste disposal, and equipment-rental industries. Each grew into enterprises with at least $1 billion in annual revenue. In 2011, the entrepreneur gained majority control of Express-1 Expedited Solutions, a freight-services provider with a market value of about $72 million that he renamed XPO Logistics. Its market capitalization peaked at $16.8 billion a decade later. Jacobs, a math and music major at Bennington College and Brown University, never completed his degree. Music offered the trained classical pianist lessons relevant to business, such as \u201cwhen to go fast and when to go slow,\u201d he adds. TIME recently spoke with Jacobs, about possibly reinventing himself via a $30-billion company, cures for clogged supply chains, and integrating takeovers successfully. The interview has been condensed and edited for clarity. How soon will another recession hit America and how badly might it hurt XPO? It is a near certainty that we\u2019re going to go into a recession over the next few quarters. It could be deeper than people might be expecting. But I am optimistic it won\u2019t last long. A downturn is a negative thing for the transportation industry because growth of a transportation company in part depends on the flow of goods. We continue to invest in our business regardless of where we are in the economic cycle to be well-positioned when economic activity starts to pick up again. Our biggest secret is proprietary technology, which has been a big part of our growth. [It] is of immense value during a healthy economy and a not so healthy economy. That allows us to grab market share profitably. You reinvent yourself every decade or so. But you\u2019re now 66. Will your next reinvention be your last hurrah before retirement? I doubt that. I was born to be a CEO. The job matches my skill set just perfectly and gives me a lot of satisfaction apart from the money. I\u2019m going to do my very best to be as busy as possible until the day I die. For the most part, it\u2019s going to be as a CEO. Yet you aren\u2019t CEO of anything today. Maybe that\u2019s why you\u2019re eager to do another deal soon. Why are falling SPACs on your shopping list? I\u2019m looking at dozens of SPACs that were $10 a share and are now a fraction of that. I\u2019m not interested in most of them because I don\u2019t see where significant growth is going to come from. Scalability is the most important thing I look for when I get into an industry. For me, growing a company dramatically is a prerequisite to creating tremendous shareholder value. But with my extra billion dollars on their balance sheet and me as their dynamic new CEO, I could see some of those SPAC companies becoming very big companies. Might you instead acquire a very big company with spectacular growth potential? That\u2019s harder to do when you\u2019re already big, but not impossible. M&A is a lot like having kids. It\u2019s very hard to plan exactly. You have to be patient and disciplined. I\u2019m in a hurry to do the right deal, something that I\u2019m confident will create tons of money for my shareholders. But I\u2019m not in a hurry to do the wrong deal. My next acquisition could be something that\u2019s only a couple hundred million dollars in revenue. Or it could be something that has $30 billion of revenue. I would devise a business plan to grow its profitability. I don\u2019t necessarily have to buy 100% of a company. I could invest a billion or billion and a half dollars so I have a significant shareholder stake and then become CEO. During the recent supply-chain crisis, XPO helped unsnarl bottlenecks for customers in several industries. What moves are you making that will benefit your customers when the supply chain clogs again? We\u2019re doing many things that should have tremendous positive effects for years. We\u2019re now spending significant [amounts] getting more trucks. We nearly tripled our production of trailers. Our driver training schools will probably graduate twice as many new drivers this year than last year. All these things primarily create more capacity. We\u2019re able to process more freight for customers, and that helps unsnarl customer supply chains. Between 70% and 90% of acquisitions fail, often due to poor integration. What\u2019s the most important step you took to successfully integrate 500-plus acquired businesses? I respected the people who came with the acquisitions. The single biggest mistake that acquirers make after buying a company is that on day one, they think they have all the answers. Guess what? They don\u2019t. [Employees] feel disrespected, and many leave. It\u2019s foolish to think you\u2019ve got all the answers before you\u2019ve asked the people actually running the business every day what makes this company great and what\u2019s holding the company back that should be done differently. In the early days of an acquisition, we use our ears and eyes a lot more than our mouths.We want to unleash great ideas that team members have had that never got their day in the sun. We solicit very valuable input from people on the front line and at all levels of management. You create a culture where people realize they are rewarded to speak up and say not just good things, but also difficult things in a respectful way. People feel empowered. We get an avalanche of extremely valuable insights that we almost always use to modify the business plan we had based our purchase on. Mario Harik, your successor as XPO\u2019s chief, was among your first hires there, and you undoubtedly groomed him to assume command. How should other companies better prepare internal contenders for the corner office especially when its present occupant wears huge shoes? Create a deep bench of executives whom you expose to all the key things going on in the company, even if it\u2019s not their direct responsibilities. The several dozen top executives learn about all different aspects of running a company, so they understand other senior executives\u2019 techniques and practices. It becomes an in-house education. [That\u2019s] the way we ran XPO over the last decade. I never siloed executives, like you see in most companies. We created a big bench of CEO candidates. Look at Drew Wilkerson, now CEO of RXO. He benefited tremendously from seeing how other leaders were managing their businesses inside the company. How will you avoid micromanaging Mario while serving as XPO\u2019s executive chairman? Mario does not need any micromanaging. He\u2019s much smarter than I am. In terms of mentoring, I will continue to be part boss but largely his colleague, peer, and sounding board. I [also] serve as kind of a therapist, counselor, advisor, and friend. I\u2019m not going to be intruding more than I should. I will let him be the CEO. What special skills do young people need these days to succeed in business if they imitate your example and lack a college degree? Education is important for someone coming into the workforce who has ambitious career plans. Do they have to get a degree? Not necessarily. But they have to cultivate an attitude of wanting to be a lifelong learner. You also need to learn to write. You\u2019re not likely to become a CEO of a multibillion-dollar company if you have poor grammar. And generally speaking, you have to work your tail off to be very successful in business. Years ago, you wanted to call your garbage business Jacobs Waste Systems. But your father disliked that idea and so you named it United Waste Systems instead. Will you put your surname on the next business that you buy and grow? For me, business has never been about ego. It\u2019s about making money for shareholders. If putting my name as part of the company name helps with creating shareholder value, I\u2019m more than happy to do it. I\u2019m big on accountability. People should dream big, set big goals, be very specific [about] the milestones, and then be visible in holding yourself and your team members accountable for progress you\u2019re making. When you put your name on a company, it says, \u201cI take responsibility for everything that happens in this company.\u201d It shows the reputation and fortune of the company [are] as important as your own personal reputation, fortune, and success.",

    "content": "EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. \u2014 On a dreary afternoon, after the Chicago Bears\u2019 fifth consecutive loss, the vibe inside the visiting locker room at MetLife Stadium felt predictably glum. For starters, a 31-10 pummeling by the New York Jets triggered a different kind of disappointment within a last-place team that had lost eight times before Sunday. \u201cI thought we got our asses kicked, honestly,\u201d tight end Cole Kmet said. Advertisement But there was much more to this latest dejection: the anguish that comes with watching team leaders fall by the wayside. Safety Eddie Jackson hobbled out of the locker room with a walking boot on his left foot. He was hurt in the second quarter, his foot giving out as he tried to cut on what turned out to be a 54-yard Jets touchdown pass. Almost immediately, Jackson\u2019s absence was felt. Advertisement \u201cHe\u2019s a (bleeping) leader, bro,\u201d defensive tackle Justin Jones said. \u201cHe\u2019s a hell of a player. I hope he\u2019s OK and I hope he can come back soon. Because we need him on defense. We really do.\u201d Added linebacker Nicholas Morrow: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to replace a guy like that.\u201d [ [Don't miss] Week 12 recap: Starting QB confusion and injuries mark Chicago Bears\u2019 31-10 loss to New York Jets ] In the third quarter, receiver Darnell Mooney exited with a left ankle injury, his day ending when Jets safety Jordan Whitehead landed on the back of his leg as Mooney engaged in a block during a David Montgomery run. Mooney couldn\u2019t put an ounce of weight on his leg as he was assisted to the locker room. His exit also hit teammates hard. \u201cIt stinks,\u201d quarterback Trevor Siemian said. \u201cAs a player, (losing him) is terrible. But if you\u2019ve spent any time with Darnell, he\u2019s one of the best dudes in our locker room. That\u2019s the part of the game that stinks.\u201d Added Kmet: \u201cYou hate to see a guy like Moon go down. He\u2019s just a bright, vibrant guy in the huddle and obviously a big playmaker. When you lose him, it\u2019s tough for sure.\u201d Bears wide receiver Darnell Mooney (11) leaves with an injury in the third quarter Sunday, Nov. 27, 2022, at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J. (Brian Cassella / Chicago Tribune) From the look of things, it would be stunning if either Jackson or Mooney is available for next Sunday\u2019s game against the Green Bay Packers at Soldier Field. Until more is known about the specifics of either injury, the prospect of one or both players landing on injured reserve can\u2019t be ruled out. \u201cWhen you lose the production of those guys, number one, that always hurts,\u201d coach Matt Eberflus said. \u201cBut then also it\u2019s the leadership part. Those guys have been great in the locker room. They\u2019re great teammates.\u201d Advertisement For the Bears, Sunday will go into the books as one of the worst days in a rough season. In addition to the injuries to Jackson and Mooney, right tackle Riley Reiff left with a shoulder issue and his replacement, Larry Borom, also was unable to finish because of an injury the team didn\u2019t disclose. Reserve safety Dane Cruikshank suffered a hamstring injury. Rookie defensive backfield starters Kyler Gordon and Jaquan Brisker were inactive because of concussions suffered a week earlier in Atlanta. So, yes, the Bears were significantly short-handed in their attempt to sidestep a winless November. About the only good to come out of Sunday was the team\u2019s decision to keep starting quarterback Justin Fields inactive with a separated left shoulder. Fields, who wasn\u2019t formally ruled out until 90 minutes before kickoff, never gained clearance to play from the Bears medical staff. Even after that call was made and Siemian got the green light to start, he, too, had his own hard luck, straining an oblique muscle during pregame warmups. Yep, you read that correctly. The backup quarterback strained an oblique \u2014 in warmups. That triggered the Bears to announce that Nathan Peterman would start. Until Siemian received some pain-relieving aid, fought through his discomfort and got clearance to play less than 15 minutes before kickoff. Advertisement \u201cHonestly, I\u2019m more embarrassed,\u201d Siemian said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a room full of guys in there playing in Week 12, going through hell, and I have a non-contact thing show up. Yeah, not ideal.\u201d As for Sunday\u2019s game, the Bears\u2019 fifth consecutive loss was their most lopsided this season, both in margin of defeat and competitive fight shown. Jets quarterback Mike White, making his first start of the year, threw for 315 yards with three touchdown passes and a 149.3 passer rating. At times he looked like Aaron Rodgers, operating calmly from the pocket, finding completions, then mixing in a flurry of timely big plays. Jets quarterback Mike White (5) celebrates a touchdown pass in the third quarter Sunday, Nov. 27, 2022, at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J. (Brian Cassella / Chicago Tribune) Garrett Wilson (five catches, 95 yards) caught two of White\u2019s touchdown passes, the first after breaking free from a hold by Bears cornerback Kindle Vildor. The Jets also got a 32-yard touchdown run from backup running back Ty Johnson that came with at least three Bears defenders \u2014 linebacker Jack Sanborn and safeties DeAndre Houston-Carson and Elijah Hicks \u2014 failing to finish fairly routine tackle attempts. The Jets averaged 7.5 yards per play as the Bears defense failed to come up with a takeaway while producing only one sack. \u201cI know we probably had a lot of guys playing who were surprised to be in there,\u201d Jones said. \u201cBut we have to make sure those guys are ready.\u201d Advertisement Without Fields, meanwhile, the Bears offense lacked any significant pop. They scored 10 points on their first two possessions, then went scoreless for the final 44 minutes, 20 seconds. [ [Don't miss] How concerning is Justin Fields\u2019 left shoulder injury? How has Luke Getsy performed as OC? 4 questions facing the Chicago Bears. ] The offense\u2019s 292 total yards marked the fifth time this season that unit failed to reach 300. Over the final three quarters, the Bears managed only 156 yards and eight first downs. Eberflus couldn\u2019t even lean on his team\u2019s competitive tenacity as a bright spot. \u201cNo excuses, no explanations,\u201d he said. \u201cIt just wasn\u2019t good enough. I told the guys in the locker room, \u2018We\u2019re better than that.\u2019\u201d Right now, though, the 3-9 Bears aren\u2019t better than many teams. The only team with fewer wins is the 1-9-1 Houston Texans. Still, five games remain. And with the losses and injuries piling up, the Bears have to find extra reserves to retain their focus and commitment through the finish line. Advertisement \u201cIt comes down to the individual,\u201d Eberflus said. \u201cWe have men of character in that locker room. They\u2019ve been battling the whole way. And we\u2019re going to continue to rely on that for sure. And then it comes down to daily practice and daily habits. What are you doing every single day to get better?\u201d At this point, the Bears\u2019 \u201cget better\u201d demands include a worrisome list of notable players working to recover from significant injuries.",

The recent Glassnode data shows that the average retail investor likely remains bullish on crypto, with smaller holders stacking it up. Bitcoin has been battered by the unfavorable macro environment as well as the downfalls of such major players as Terra and FTX.

    "content": "Market analyst Benjamin Cowen speculates that a Bitcoin price bottom could be reached in December. Market watchers have been having mixed expectations for when the BTC bear market will end. Market analysts continue to speculate that the price of Bitcoin may have not reached a bottom at its current price. Crypto analyst Benjamin Cowen is among such commentators who expect the market to mimic other bear market cycles, particularly the capitulation scenario of 2018. In a new analysis, Cowen opined that it would not be unreasonable to expect a bottoming scenario similar to that of 2018 in which BTC made a series of slightly higher lows before sharply capitulating to new lows to reach its price bottom. Cowen extrapolated historical data from the 200-day moving average technical indicator to support his argument. According to him, the current market could see a potential capitulation event to mark the bottom around the Christmas holiday of this year. At this point, BTC could be poised for a bull run. He added; We could sort of extrapolate out the 200-day simple moving average if it were to continue on down on its current trajectory, where might it cross?\u2026 You could see that it would cross somewhere in late December, right around Christmas, December 25th, December 26th, December 27th, around the holidays is where it would cross, While conceding that the analysis is just speculation, he further noted that bear cycles in the Bitcoin market have historically lasted an average of one year. The current bear market has been going on for over a year and therefore may soon come to an end, he said, adding the disclaimer that investors should not spend too much energy trying to call the bottom. So far in 2022 making the case for the bottom has not really served anyone well, and that\u2019s why at the beginning of the year we said, \u2018Look, don\u2019t spend too much mental energy trying to call a bottom in 2022\u2019 Could the price of BTC continue to crash? Previously, Cowen told his over 770k subscribers to watch out for the crossing of the Bitcoin percentage of supply in profit and the Bitcoin 30-day moving average metrics as the occurrence could mark the market bottom as it has done in other bear markets. While this cross has yet to materialize, analysts and market participants are expecting the price of Bitcoin to fall further than even the two-year low price of around $15,600 it reached last week. According to a Wall Street Journal (WSJ) report, Jake Wujastyk, VP at TrendSpider LLC, has speculated that the Bitcoin market had formed a clear \u201cbear flag\u201d and would inevitably drop to new lows or potentially drop to zero. In contrast, Galaxy Digital\u2019s Mike Novogratz recently asserted that crypto is not going anywhere and will recover to new highs. BTC is trading at around $16,200, down 2.07 percent in the last 24 hours at the time of writing.

You get a different amount of power based on the device, the port, the battery level, and whatever else is drawing current. It can make you wish for a few ports that power whatever you plug in, whatever the size. You used to need a big surge protector, packed with charging bricks crowding each other out, to get that kind of juice. But these days, gallium nitride-based chargers can put out serious power from a small space. We've scanned the marketplace, tried out a few of them, and have some recommendations for different power needs.

    "content": "The crypto market is currently under selling pressure as the majority of crypto assets were posting significant losses at the time of writing. SHIB , however, has managed to cushion the selling effect slightly as it posts lesser losses in comparison to other major cryptocurrencies.

For context, cryptocurrencies such as Dogecoin and Huobi Token were posting losses of 10% and 14%, respectively. Despite the drop in price across the board, SHIB is demonstrating gains of 83% in its trading volume.

    "content": "In a recent tweet, Musk shared a slide of a discussion in one of the company\u2019s talks in which \u201cTwitter 2.0\u201d was unveiled. In the past week, Dogecoin has surged by 24 percent owing largely to developments around Twitter. The world\u2019s richest man Elon Musk recently completed a $44 billion deal to take over Twitter on October 27, 2022. His takeover has been good news to free speech advocates with the Dogecoin community also expecting something positive with his long-standing interest in the ecosystem. In a recent tweet, Musk shared a slide of a discussion in one of the company\u2019s talks in which \u201cTwitter 2.0\u201d was unveiled. This is officially branded as \u201cThe Everything App\u201d. Even though not much information was disclosed about this development, Musk revealed that there could be new features including long-form tweets, the relaunch of blue-verified payments, and encrypted DMs. However, the silence on the payment option has left the community in anticipation. With his interest in crypto and based on his previous tweets, it is expected that Dogecoin would be integrated into Twitter 2.0. In the past week, Dogecoin has surged by 24 percent as investors react positively to the Twitter 2.0 development. Its trading volume is $1,983,041,808.96, an 83 percent surge in the last 24 hours according to market data. Elon Musk previously said that Dogecoin is the real currency in an interview with the media. The point is that Dogecoin was invented as a joke, essentially to make fun of cryptocurrency. Fate loves irony. What would be the most ironic outcome? The currency that started as a joke becomes the real currency. To the moon! Dogecoin to become the crypto of Twitter? In an interview with Time Magazine, Musk disclosed that he would consider Dogecoin as a transactional currency rather than Bitcoin. His reason was primarily due to the transaction flow of both currencies. At least at a space level, it is suitable as a store of value. But fundamentally, Bitcoin is not a good substitute for transactional currency. The total transaction flow that you do with Dogecoin in transactions per day has a much higher potential than Bitcoin. In April, Musk disclosed the idea of adding Dogecoin as a payment method for the Twitter subscription service, Blue, triggering a price surge. Jane Manchun Wong, a popular tech blogger also mentioned that Twitter was working on a wallet prototype that would support crypto deposit and withdrawal. However, the type of crypto or the network is completely unknown. Avi Felman, head of trading at BlockTower Capital believes that most investors purchase the meme coin because they think it should have value. According to him, Musk is only pushing the message of \u201cwhy can\u2019t Doge have value?\u201d This is because people like these kinds of messages. Dogecoin becoming the crypto of Twitter is just a matter of time.

    "description": "The meme coin\u2019s latest bull run may be related to the speculation that it could be involved in Elon Musk\u2019s plans for Twitter.",
    "content": "Dogecoin has shot up over 22.5% in the past week, jumping from $0.075 to $0.094, according to CoinGecko . The rapid price increase may follow speculation that the leading meme coin will be included in potential plans for Twitter to incorporate payments , which according to a transcript originally reported by Vox , would also incorporate crypto payments. Though unconfirmed as of yet, some have speculated that a move by the new owner to incorporate financial services into Twitter could also see Musk\u2019s preferred cryptocurrency become involved in some way. In a Sunday tweet, Musk shared slides from an internal Twitter presentation. Unpacking \"Twitter 2.0,\" he outlined several potential changes, including encrypted DMs and long-form tweets. The presentation also includes a blank space next to payments, leading some to speculate that a cryptocurrency may be used. The latest rally now places Dogecoin eighth in the ranking of the largest cryptocurrencies by market cap. At roughly $13 billion , the cryptocurrency is larger than Polygon, Cardano, Litecoin, and Solana. Dogecoin was created in 2013 by IBM software engineer Billy Markus and Adobe engineer Jackson Palmer, reportedly to mock coins such as Bitcoin with lofty plans of taking over the world. Since then, its ebbs and flows have been strongly connected to statements made by the billionaire. The meme coin\u2019s initial bull run began in January 2021, when Musk first started making statements about the coin on Twitter. The currency rocketed up 57% in just 24 hours on February 4, 2021, following the Tesla chief posting a photoshopped image from the popular Disney film The Lion King with him holding up Dogecoin\u2019s Shibu Inu canine logo. Musk-related volatility has historically also pushed Dogecoin down, as well as up. In May 2021, when he appeared on Saturday Night Live and appeared to mock the coin, it lost around 30% of its value in the immediate aftermath. Aside from Musk-related speculation, the news comes as the technical foundations of the meme coin may soon begin undergoing serious improvements. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin confirmed in February this year that he would work with Dogecoin Foundation so that the coin could undergo a transition to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) from its current Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism.

Interest is typically expressed as a percentage of the amount of money that has been borrowed, and it is typically paid on a regular basis (such as monthly or yearly).",
    "content": "When it comes to finances, the term \u201cinterest\u201d refers to the amount of money that is paid by a borrower to a lender in order to use the money that has been lent. Interest is typically expressed as a percentage of the amount of money that has been borrowed, and it is typically paid on a regular basis (such as monthly or yearly). When it comes to crypto assets, interest can be generated in a number of ways. For example, some crypto assets pay interest to holders on a regular basis, much like a traditional savings account. In other words, crypto dividends. As a result, flexibility is limited. Other crypto assets may offer interest-bearing products, such as loans or credit products, that allow users to earn interest on their deposited funds. The practice is known as crypto lending and is considered highly risky. Still, others may offer staking rewards to users who lock up their assets for a set period of time. Staking a coin requires trusting the coin, network, and team. Last but not least, crypto trading can be automated. A number of companies automate the crypto trading process and invest for the benefit of their users. As part of their continuous reporting, automated crypto trading companies like Haru Invest release their recent performance numbers. They even allows you to calculate future earnings. Regardless of the method, earning interest on crypto assets can be a great way to boost one\u2019s returns. Why earning interest on your crypto holdings can be a good idea? Many people who invest in cryptocurrencies do so with the expectation of earning a return on their investment. One way to earn a return on your crypto holdings is to earn interest on them. There are a few reasons why this can be a good idea. First, it can help you to grow your holdings without having to put any additional money into them. This can compound over time , leading to significant growth. Second, it can provide you with a steady stream of income that can help offset any losses that you may incur. Finally, it can help to diversify your portfolio and reduce your overall risk. For these reasons, earning interest on your crypto holdings can be a smart move. What are the benefits of compound interest over time? Compound interest is often described as the \u2018eighth wonder of the world\u2019, and for good reason. It is a powerful force that can work wonders for anyone who saves regularly, whether for retirement, a rainy day fund, or some other purpose. Unlike simple interest, which is calculated on the original principal only, compound interest is calculated on the principal plus any accrued interest. This means that the longer money is left to grow, the more rapidly it will grow. For example, if someone deposits $100 into a savings account with an annual interest rate of 5%, they will have $105 at the end of the first year. In the second year, they will earn interest on the $105, rather than just on the original $100. Image source: https://www.ncl.ac.uk/webtemplate/ask-assets/external/maths-resources/finance/simple-and-compound-interest.html As a result, their balance will grow even faster, and compound interest will really start to work its magic as time goes on. Over time, even small amounts of money can grow to large sums through compound interest. This makes it an extremely powerful tool for anyone who wants to build long-term wealth. \u200b David Bold David is a crypto enthusiast and an expert in personal finance.

    "content": "The final round of the group stage of the World Cup brings with it a multitude of possibilities for each team to advance in the tournament. This year\u2019s tournament in particular\u2014which has already seen thrilling last-minute goals, stunning comebacks, and shock defeats of favorites\u2014is anything but predictable. And with so many ways it can play out, every kick over the next four days will matter. The group stage in its current form actually makes up most of the World Cup, comprising 48 of the 64 games. Within each group of four teams, it\u2019s a round-robin-style competition to finish in the top two spots based on points: three points are earned for a win, one for a draw, and zero for a loss. The bottom two teams from each of the eight groups are eliminated from the tournament. [time-brightcove not-tgx=\u201dtrue\u201d] And while finishing first or second ensures a team moves on to the Round of 16, the specific order in which they advance is important, too. The winner of Group A plays the runner-up of Group B, the runner-up of A plays the winner of B, and so on for Groups C and D, E and F, and G and H. There\u2019s something special about the final round. As of Monday evening, each team in all eight groups has faced off against two other teams in their group and has one remaining game to accumulate any more points. The stakes are raised for these third matchups, as every team knows it\u2019s their last chance to do what they need to do to stay in the tournament. And unlike in the first two rounds, the final two matches for each group are played simultaneously, making it a nerve-wracking 90 minutes for all teams involved\u2014and for the fans who are trying to monitor every potential outcome. Read More: Team USA\u2019s World Cup Fate Is in Their Own Hands Following Tie With England Often teams in a group finish with the same number of points, but unlike in the knockout stage, there are no penalty shootouts. In the event of a tie on points in the group stage, places are determined by a series of tiebreakers. First, total goal difference (all of the team\u2019s goals scored across their three matches minus all of their goals conceded). If still tied, just the number of goals scored are considered. If still tied, the teams\u2019 head-to-head results determine which finishes ahead of the other. FIFA introduced a fourth \u201cfair play\u201d tiebreaker during the last World Cup. According to FIFA\u2019s website, \u201cthe team that has accumulated the fewest indiscipline points wins (a yellow card equals 1 point, a red card shown for two yellows equals 3 points, a direct red card equals 4 points and a direct red card shown to a player who was already on a yellow equals 5 points).\u201d If somehow teams were still tied, which finishes ahead of the other would theoretically be determined by a drawing of lots, though no team has ever been eliminated from a World Cup that way. Here\u2019s a guide to all the different potential outcomes this week, listed in order of most likely to least likely, based on a model by American data analysis website FiveThirtyEight. But with so many upsets thus far in the competition, don\u2019t count out the underdogs. Group A In Group A, World Cup host nation Qatar (currently with 0 points) has no chance of advancing to the knockout stage of the competition, while group leader Netherlands (4 points) is very likely to advance. Ecuador (4 points) will stay in the competition with a draw or a win against Senegal, while Senegal (3 points) needs to beat Ecuador to move on to the next round. The matches kick off at 10 a.m. Eastern time on Tuesday, November 29. Ayman Aref\u2014NurPhoto/Getty ImagesFans of the Qatar national team during the World Cup the opening match between the host nation and Ecuador at Al Bayt Stadium on Nov. 20, 2022. [28.86%] Netherlands beats Qatar, Ecuador beats Senegal: Both Netherlands (7 points) and Ecuador (7 points) advance, with the order determined by which team wins by more goals in their final match. If they both win by the same margin, whichever team scores more goals in their final match finishes first in the group. If they both win by the same score, the next applicable tiebreaker (since they drew head-to-head) is \u201cfair play.\u201d Netherlands goes into the final match slightly leading on that metric, having received only two yellow cards in previous matches, compared to Ecuador\u2019s three yellow cards. If still tied, the order is determined by a drawing of lots. [25.74%] Netherlands beats Qatar, Ecuador draws Senegal: Netherlands (7 points) win the group. Ecuador (5 points) advances as runner-up.

[2.31%] Qatar beats Netherlands, Ecuador draws Senegal: Ecuador (5 points) wins the group, and either Netherlands (4 points) or Senegal (4 points) advances as runner-up. If Netherlands loses to Qatar by one goal, Netherlands advances based on goal difference. If Netherlands loses to Qatar by two goals, whichever of Senegal or Netherlands scores more goals in their final match advances; if they score the same number of goals in their final match, Netherlands advances based on having previously beaten Senegal head-to-head. If Netherlands loses to Qatar by three goals or more, Senegal advances based on goal difference. [2.1%] Qatar beats Netherlands, Senegal beats Ecuador: Senegal (6 points) wins the group, and whichever of Netherlands (4 points) or Ecuador (4 points) loses by fewer goals advances as runner-up. If Netherlands and Ecuador lose by the same number of goals, whichever team scores more goals in their final match advances. If they both lose their final match by the same score, the next applicable tiebreaker (since they drew head-to-head) is \u201cfair play.\u201d Netherlands goes into the final match slightly leading on that metric, having received only two yellow cards in previous matches, compared to Ecuador\u2019s three yellow cards. If still tied, the team that advances is determined by a drawing of lots. Group B Group B leader England (currently with 4 points) is in a good position to advance, barring a big loss to Wales. Team USA (2 points) and Iran (3 points), meanwhile, are in a winner-takes-all battle. And Wales (1 point) needs to win against England to have a chance. The matches kick off at 2 p.m. Eastern time on Tuesday, November 29.

[9.88%] Wales and England draw, USA beats Iran: Both England (5 points) and the United States (5 points) advance. England will be the winner of the group unless Team USA beats Iran by four goals or more. If the U.S. beats Iran by five goals or more, the U.S. advances as the group winner. If the U.S. beats Iran by four goals, the next tiebreaker will be goals scored, which England leads the U.S. by four going into the final matches. If they remain tied, the next applicable tiebreaker (since they drew head-to-head) is \u201cfair play.\u201d England goes into the final match leading on that metric, having received zero yellow cards in previous matches, compared to the four yellow cards the U.S. has received. If still tied, the order is determined by a drawing of lots. [8.06%] Wales and England draw, Iran beats USA: Iran (6 points) wins the group. England (5 points) advances as runner-up.

If Wales beats England by 7 goals or more, Wales wins the group, and Iran advances as runner-up. If Wales beats England by six goals, Wales wins the group, and either Iran or England advances as runner-up based on goals scored, which England leads Iran by two going into the final matches. If still tied (i.e. Wales beats England 6-0, Iran draws USA 2-2), England advances because it beat Iran when the two teams met head-to-head last week. Group C Saudi Arabia shook up Group C last week with its shock defeat of tournament favorites Argentina. Poland (currently with 4 points) now tops the group and only needs a draw to advance. Saudi Arabia (3 points) advances with a win against Mexico, and Argentina (3 points) advances with a win against Poland. At the bottom of the table, Mexico (1 point), a team that has yet to score a goal in this tournament, needs to beat Saudi Arabia to have any hope of advancing. The matches kick off at 2 p.m. Eastern time on Wednesday, November 30. Jabin Botsford\u2014The Washington Post/Getty ImagesSaudi Arabia fans celebrate after a goal by midfielder Salem Al-Dawsari against Argentina at Lusail Stadium on Nov. 22, 2022.

If still tied, the team that advances is determined by a drawing of lots. [17.98%] Argentina beats Poland, Saudi Arabia and Mexico draw: Argentina (6 points) wins the group, and either Poland (4 points) or Saudi Arabia (4 points) advances as runner-up. Poland advances if it loses to Argentina by two goals or fewer; Saudi Arabia advances if Poland loses to Argentina by four goals or more. If Poland loses to Argentina by three goals, either Poland or Saudi Arabia advances based on whichever team scores more goals in their final match; if they score the same number of goals, Poland advances because it beat Saudi Arabia head-to-head.

Group D In Group D, reigning World Cup champion France (currently with 6 points) has already guaranteed its advancement to the knockout stage. Australia (3 points) advances with a win or a draw against Denmark, and Denmark (1 point) advances if it beats Australia. Tunisia (1 point) needs to beat France to have a chance at advancing, though it would still depend on the outcome of the game between Australia and Denmark.

Now every team still has a chance to qualify for the knockout stage. Spain (currently with 4 points) is guaranteed to advance if they draw or win against Japan. Japan (3 points) will advance with a win against Spain, and Costa Rica (3 points) will advance with a win against Germany. It\u2019s not entirely in the Germans\u2019 hands, as Germany (1 point) needs to beat Costa Rica and it needs Japan not to win against Spain in order to advance.

If still tied (i.e. Costa Rica beats Germany 7-0, Japan beats Spain 6-5), Costa Rica wins the group based on having previously beaten Japan head-to-head. Group F In Group F, underdog Morocco (currently with 4 points) is now favorite to advance, with a win or a draw against Canada guaranteeing a spot in the Round of 16 and even a loss not ruling them out. Last World Cup\u2019s finalist Croatia (4 points) will advance with a win or a draw, while FIFA\u2019s No. 2-ranked team in the world Belgium (3 points) needs to beat Croatia to advance.

Group G Like France, World Cup favorite Brazil (currently with 6 points) has already secured a spot in the Round of 16, and it\u2019s almost certainly set to top Group G. Switzerland (3 points) will advance with a win, while Cameroon (1 point) and Serbia (1 point) each need to win to have a chance at advancing, but even then it\u2019s not guaranteed and would be dependent on the result of the other match.

If still tied (i.e. South Korea beats Portugal 3-1, Ghana beats Uruguay 1-0), Portugal wins the group based on having previously beaten Ghana head-to-head.",

    "content": "SPOKANE, Wash. \u2014 As we head into the holiday season, a time of giving gifts of all kinds \u2014 electronic toys, tools and gadgets \u2014 the Spokane Fire Department is educating us on the risks that come with the newest innovations. You\u2019ve probably seen videos online (like this one) of phones and other electronic devices combusting. Those explosions are the results of thermal runaway, a chemical reaction that happens when the temperature within a battery (like the one in your cell phone) exceeds a certain point. Essentially, the heat generated is greater than the heat dispersed, and it sparks a chemical reaction and oftentimes, a fire. \u201cThrough every new invention and every new innovation that comes into society, there is always a period of time where public safety has to adapt to the new reality,\u201d Spokane Fire Chief Brian Schaeffer said. \u201cThe new risk that innovation brings to society.\u201d Right now, that newer innovation is lithium-ion batteries, and we\u2019re still very much learning about the safety and health risks these products present. Meanwhile, we use them in just about every facet of our life. In October, SFD hosted a national seminar that focused on fires started by these batteries. They brought leaders and scientists together from all over the country in hopes of better understanding the dangers that come from fires involving lithium-ion batteries. \u201cWe know what is in that off-gasoline material,\u201d Schaeffer said. \u201cIt\u2019s volatile, it\u2019s carcinogenic, and many of those chemicals once they enter your body, they never leave.\u201d As a result, it\u2019s the firefighters who bear the brunt of this when they\u2019re protecting our community, by putting out these types of fires. So where do we see these batteries? \u201cThings like toys that run on rechargeable batteries, kitchen devices that run on lithium-ion batteries,\u201d Schaeffer said. \u201cEssentially any type of electronic device that you would use in a cordless fashion, there is a high likelihood it\u2019s a lithium-ion battery. All lithium-ion batteries will have an indicator on the underside of it that shows, \u2018Li-ion.'\u201d How do we use them safely? Charge the batteries only when you\u2019re home and present, and within an area without combustibles. When the devices are fully charged, get them off the charger to prevent over-charging. If you have a lithium-ion battery that\u2019s been damaged, take it to the Waste to Energy Plant in Spokane, so they can dispose of it properly.

    "content": "Fidelity has launched its Fidelity Crypto product according to a report. The move is the latest bullish crypto development being pioneered by the $4.5 trillion asset manager. Financial services giant Fidelity has launched its retail cryptocurrency trading product called \u2018Fidelity Crypto\u2019 to allow users to trade Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH). According to reporting by the Block, Fidelity has been sending emails to some users saying \u201cthe wait is over.\u201d Users who signed up for the product were notified that a Fidelity brokerage account that maintains a minimum balance of $1 was needed to be able to fund a new Fidelity Crypto account. The product allows for commission-free trading of the two leading cryptocurrencies. However, Fidelity says a spread of 1 percent will be factored into every trade execution price. The product also allows Fidelity\u2019s clients the use of custodial and trading services provided by its subsidiary Fidelity Digital Assets, as well as get access to crypto educational materials. The launch of the product is coming after Fidelity opened a waitlist earlier this month for interested clients to join. At the time, Fidelity, which has over $4.5 trillion worth of assets under management (AUM), said that it has noted high interest in crypto trading from its clients hence the launch of the product. Fidelity told CNBC in a statement; Where our customers invest matters more than ever. A meaningful portion of Fidelity customers are already interested in and own crypto. We are providing them with tools to support their choice, so they can benefit from Fidelity\u2019s education, research, and technology, Meanwhile, the launch is not the financial services company\u2019s first foray into the crypto market. Fidelity states on its website that it has been mining Bitcoin since 2014. Fidelity also has a lineup of crypto-related exchange-traded funds (ETF) including the Fidelity Advantage Bitcoin ETF launched last year in Canada, as well as the Fidelity Crypto Industry and Digital Payments ETF (FDIG). Fidelity\u2019s attempts to launch a BTC spot-settled in the U.S. has been repeatedly rebuffed by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) while its plan to include Bitcoin in its retirement savings plans has been getting pushback from members of Congress. Institutional adoption all round bullish for BTC and crypto Despite the regulatory uncertainty, more traditional financial giants have been showing interest in the cryptocurrency industry. Like Fidelity, BlackRock has also launched crypto-related ETFs and has stated that it is awaiting regulatory clarity to delve into direct crypto exposure. These firms with their massive reach could be a potential catalyst to drive BTC and the crypto market to new levels of mainstream adoption. Institutional investors have also been known to drive crypto prices to new highs with their investments.

    "content": "Tickmill ReviewTickmill is a Metatrader broker, a member of the Tickmill Group is a regulated platform by the Seychelles Financial Services Authority, as Tickmill reviews show. The broker has put itself in a strong position as a trusted market leader as the Tickmill broker review show. But, do all traders think Tickmill is a decent broker? Let\u2019s find out in our Tickmill reviews and analysis.The brokerage was built by traders that already had some trading experience from back in the day when they traded on financial markets across the world. The goal now according to the Tickmill review is to provide institutional clients as well as retail clients with a trading platform that will help them reach their full potential.Tickmill is a MetaTrader broker that offers a small selection of tradeable securities and offers high commission-based pricing via its VIP And PRO accounts.ProsTickmill is regulated in one tier-1 jurisdiction and two tier-2 jurisdictions. The platform offers a wide suite of Metatrader features and various add-ons. The pricing for the accounts is highly competitive and It also offers the CQG platform for options and futures trading. ConsThere are only a few markets available for trading. The pricing for the classic accounts is not competitive.The platform is considered an average risk and it is not publicly traded.Tickmill OfferingsTickmill offers 85 tradeable assets such as CFDs on currency pairs, metals, indices, crypto, and bonds. There are 62 symbols available for futures and options trading via a separate account.Also, crypto trading at Tickmill is available via CFDs but not via trading of an underlying asset like BTC. Crypto CFDs are also not available to retail traders in the UK.Commissions and feesCFDS come with high risks of losing money due to leverage. Up to 76% of the retail CFD accounts lose money according to Tickmill bonus review. Always make sure you understand how CFDs work and know to invest only the amounts you can lose.Tickmill offers three accounts: Classic, Pro, and VIP.-Classic: the classic account is commission free but traders only pay the bid or ask spread. However, the average spreads for this account are higher than the other two account types.PRO account: this account type alongside the VIP account has a per-trade commission which is added to lower spreads. The low commission rate and low-cost spreads, make this account ideal for traders.Traders that choose the VIP Account will have to maintain a balance of $50,000 and will have access to the low commission of $1 per standard lot. The Pro account can be accessed with only a $100 deposit but will have twice as high a commission per standard lot.Deposit and withdrawalsDepositing and withdrawing money from Tickmill is simple as the Tickmill broker review shows. The broker accepts most forms of payments that include bank transfer credit and debit cards, crypto wallets, and e-wallets. The company doesn\u2019t impose fees for making deposits and withdrawals while its processing system is fast.The payouts are also processed fast so they are set to review their minimum withdrawal amount right in their wallets or bank accounts. TickMill processes payment instantly but it does take 24 hours for the bank to clear the transaction. Also, the broker sends a payment confirmation message to the users\u2019 phones or emails after the payout is cleared according to the Tickmill withdrawal review.The clients do have to deposit $100 to open an account. It accepts deposits in USD, EUR, GBP, and PLN. It accepts cryptos like LTC, ETH, and BTC. The broker also allows the deposit of funds in ten payment system modes like credit cards, bank transfer, Skrill, Neteller, UnionPay, FASAPAY, QIWI, WEB MONEY, STICPAY, and more. There are no deposit fees to be paid.Since there are no fees to be paid to the broker, the user has to initiate a request and wait for a day to receive the minimum withdrawal amount in their account. The minimum amount for withdrawal is set at $10 but the users might have to submit ID proof for KYC verification processes if the amount is too high.TickMill Trading PlatformsTickmill is a MetaTrader-only broker and there are both Android and iOS versions of the MT4 and MT5 available for download. The platform also launched a mobile app for account management purposes as well. It even launched the Mt5 from the UK and the EU while adding TradingView as a new feature.Tickmill included the CQG platform for futures and options trading. The Trdaingview feature on the other hand is very popular among traders according to Tickmill reviews due to the powerful charting and visualizations.Other notable add-ons are available as well like the Advanced Trading toolkit and the VPS hosting.Tickmill Fees And AccountsClassic AccountTraders don\u2019t have to pay a commission fee for trading with this account on the broker\u2019s website. The trader does however need to pay the spread cost between the asking price and the bid price for trading the products. The average spread price is higher for the Classic account and it is often not preferred by beginners.SpreadsAccording to the Tickmill review, the PRO accounts offer users a spread of 0.13 pips for the EUR/USD pairs. The trading costs stand at 0.53 pips with the RT commission of 0.4 pips taken into consideration. Also, online brokerage platforms usually record the spread statistics under market conditions especially when the spreads are narrow.DiscountsTickmill offers traders a few discount options. The discounts start at the rate of $0.25 for a standard trade, up to a thousand micro-lots every month. At the third level, the discount package is $0.75 for traders that trade more than 3000 standard lots each month.FAQIs Tickmill regulated?Tickmill is regulated by the Seychelles Financial Services authority while its trading name under Tickmill UK LTC is authorized by the Financial Conduct Authority of the UK. Tickmill Europe LTD is also regulated by the Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission.2. Are there any fees for withdrawals in crypto?this broker doesn\u2019t charge fees for traders to and from its wallets for crypto deposits and withdrawals but the fees are likely applied by the crypto providers.3. Are my funds safe?Since Tickmill is regulated three-way, the funds are generally safe. the platform\u2019s internal systems are compliant with regulators. The Review Tickmill 7 Score Tickmill is a Metatrader broker, a member of the Tickmill Group which is a regulated platform by the Seychelles Financial Services Authority.

    "content": "Global markets jittered as Chinese citizens took to the streets to demonstrate against the government\u2019s strict \u201czero-COVID\u201d strategy over the weekend. The protests\u2019 immediate impact on global markets is raising questions about the way forward for the world\u2019s second-biggest economy. On Monday, the Dow fell more than 500 points after declines in the European and Asian indexes, along with a plunge in oil prices as U.S. oil fell to its lowest price in nearly a year. Cryptocurrencies also saw a slump as one economist told Bloomberg that zero-COVID policies posed a challenge to stabilizing domestic demand for crypto assets. [time-brightcove not-tgx=\u201dtrue\u201d] Most markets had regained ground by Tuesday after Chinese health authorities reported an uptick in senior vaccination rates. The pan-European Stoxx 600 was flat, while in the U.S., the S&P 500 hovered around the flatline and the Dow lost 41 points. Oil steadied after OPEC+ kept its output unchanged, with Brent crude futures up 48 cents at $83.67 a barrel. Read More: Protests Against Zero-COVID Are Rocking China. Here\u2019s What You Need to Know China\u2019s economy is already inflexible under the central control of the Communist Party, led by President Xi Jinping, but experts fear that it will become more sluggish if widespread lockdowns continue to threaten the global supply chain and fuel civil unrest. Shortly after Xi began his third term in October, the government again buckled down on its zero-COVID policies, leading to an underwhelming stock market, a weakening renminbi and capital outflows\u2014making it a difficult year for the country\u2019s economic outlook and for China\u2019s investors. Most analysts suggest that the government will need to take a more pragmatic approach to fix its economy, including loosening its COVID-19 restrictions and vaccinating higher numbers of the elderly, which is considered vital to reopening the economy. According to the latest official statistics, 32% of China\u2019s 267 million people over the age of 60 have still not received their third vaccine dose. On Monday, Mi Feng, a spokesman from the National Health Commission, reaffirmed Beijing\u2019s commitment to the zero-COVID measures. He added that complaints about the strict prevention and control measures fell under the purview of the local authorities, saying they must respond to and resolve \u201creasonable\u201d COVID-19 requests from the public in a timely manner. But rumors abound that authorities may ease restrictions with a zero-COVID exit plan, with the hope that an eventual reopening would lead to a rise in the Asian markets. Michael Hirson of 22V Research told Yahoo! Finance that the possibility of reopening is increasing as the population and local governments clearly reach exhaustion from maintaining zero-COVID policies. However, he warned that \u201ca chaotic pivot [in government policies] is likely to be highly disruptive to the economy\u2013quite possibly worse than zero-COVID, at least in the near term.\u201d",

    "description": "Historically, bull markets describe the rising of market value, while the bear market implies the falling of market value.",
    "content": "In the crypto world, the terms bull market and bear market have been adopted from their financial-market counterparts. Since you know the crypto market is volatile, prices can fluctuate rapidly, rising and falling in a matter of hours. It is, therefore, necessary for you to be well-versed to generate a consistent income from trading. For instance, if you have enough knowledge regarding chart patterns cheat sheets of the top 20 profitable chart formations, it will help you identify profitable trade setups.\u00a0 So now come to the main business. Here in this article, we will explore the difference between crypto bull and bear markets. Let's proceed! Bull market: What Is It? The term \"bull market\" was coined in traditional finance (TradFi), based on bulls' fighting style: thrusting their horns upward. Investors have used this phrase, with its upward trajectory in mind, to refer to the general market mood. Bull markets are characterized by rapid upward movement in prices. What Factors Contribute to a Bull Market? A bull market is a period of rising stock prices, usually as part of an economic recovery. Economic expansion, rising gross domestic product (GDP), falling interest rates, and higher employment are the factors that cause bull markets. Traders sometimes pay too much attention to the general opinion of financial markets, which is influenced by market emotions. Given how investors are motivated, it's easy to understand why bull markets tend to occur when several conditions exist. Features of a Crypto Bull Market Common behaviors and attitudes that define a bull market include: Poor supply despite high demand; A rise in market confidence among investors; Price increases that are sustained throughout time; Mainstream media and social media outlets are starting to mention cryptocurrencies; Overcharging for some projects hard price increases after positive news; A modest decrease in pricing when negative news is announced. Bear Market: What Is It? A bear market is when the prices of stocks and other securities are falling. An economic recession or financial crisis often causes a bear market. It can also result from negative investor sentiment, which puts downward pressure on share prices. What factors contribute to a bear market? When the economy first faces a downturn or immediately afterward, a bear market can begin. A bear market is usually caused by worsening economic conditions, such as hiring freezes and high inflation costs. These indications suggest that a recession is beginning, which will affect most investors. As a result, many people will sell off their riskier investments and invest the money in safer ones like gold or government bonds. Features of a Crypto Bear Market Common behaviors and attitudes that define a bear market include: Price declines can last for a long time; The supply outweighs the demand; Investors' lack of faith in the market; No mentions of cryptocurrencies on any social media or in the news; The general mistrust of cryptocurrency by experts and economists; Lower highs following excellent news; In the event of unfavorable news, lower lows. Major Differences Between a Bull and a Bear Market The major difference between a bull and a bear market is that they are opposite in nature. Demand and supply In a bull market, there is a high demand for cryptocurrencies and a low supply. Many investors want to purchase cryptocurrencies, but few are willing to give up their money.\u00a0 However, in a bear market, many people are buying than selling.\u00a0 Because there is less demand than there is supply, prices are falling. The Situation in the Market A market enters a bull market when the GDP rises, while a market enters a bear market when the GDP declines. This is so because expanding GDP usually coincides with rising business income and employee wages. Conversely, GDP declines when business revenues are poor, and salaries are flat or declining. Impact on the Economy A slow economy and a bear market go hand in hand. Businesses' earnings fall, and the economy suffers when customers don't spend enough and companies don't reach their revenue targets. On the other hand, a bull market is associated with a booming economy, in which earnings are stronger, and consumer spending is greater. Conclusion Cryptocurrencies are volatile assets, and their value is in constant flux. Trading in the crypto market differs from trading on the stock market. Since there are fewer traders and more unpredictable movements, it is important to know how to trade in a bearish or bullish market. So hopefully, our round-up will help you in this regard.\u00a0 Finally, if you are searching for a viable platform for investing in cryptocurrency or digital assets, you can pick Margex. Margex is designed to be a user-friendly and intuitive trading platform. It will provide you with a seamless experience from start to finish, whether you are buying or selling cryptocurrencies.",

    "description": "The Texas Securities Board has asked the judge to consider leveling a cease-and-desist order, administrative fines, and forced refunds against SBF and FTX US.",
    "content": "Former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried has been called to a Feb. 2 hearing by the Texan securities regulator as part of an investigation into whether he and FTX US have violated Texas securities laws. In a Notice of Hearing signed off by Texas State Securities Board\u2019s (SSB\u2019s) director of enforcement Joe Rotunda and served to Bankman Fried on Nov. 29, the regulator alleges that FTX US offered unregistered securities to Texans through its \u201cEARN\u201d accounts. The investigation was first announced on Oct. 14, before the dramatic collapse and bankruptcy of FTX\u2019s global operations. The regulator announced at the time it was investigating FTX Trading and FTX US and its principals including Sam Bankman-Fried for offering unregistered securities through its yield-bearing products. On Nov. 18, Rotunda used Twitter to appeal to the public to reach out to him if they were a previous client of FTX and based in Texas. If you\u2019re a client if @FTX_Official and you live in Texas, please reach out to me. We want to hear your story. My Texas State Securities Board email address is jrotunda@ssb.texas.gov. In the latest notice, the SSB alleged that Sam Bankman-Fried violated a section of the Securities Act during his role as the then-CEO of FTX. \u201cRespondent [Sam Bankman-Fried] violated Section 4003.001 of the Securities Act by offering and selling securities in Texas that were not registered or permitted for sale in Texas,\u201d said Rotunda, adding it also didn\u2019t register as a dealer or agent in Texas. The regulator said it hoped that the hearing will lead to a Cease and Desist order to prevent FTX from \u201cengaging in fraud in connection with the offer or sale of securities in Texas.\u201d It was also \u201cpraying\u201d for the judge to order Bankman-Fried to return money to Texan customers that had invested in its \u201cunregistered EARN accounts.\u201d The regulator also wants consideration of an \u201cadministrative fine\u201d to be issued to Bankman-Fried should he have gained any economic benefit from the securities law violations. This amount wouldn\u2019t exceed $20,000 per violation but could go to $250,000 for every \u201cillegal or fraudulent act\u201d that was perpetrated against Texans over the age of 65. Rotunda said the hearing will commence at 9am local time on Feb. 2, 2023, and Bankman-Fried can attend the hearing using Zoom. Related: \u2018I never opened the code for FTX\u2019: SBF has long, candid talk with vlogger Bankman-Fried is understood to currently be in the Bahamas. In a recently published interview between crypto blogger Tiffany Fong and Bankman-Fried, the former FTX CEO expressed remorse over his handling of FTX and the bankruptcy filing. \u201cYou don\u2019t get into the situation we got in if you, like, make all the right decisions,\u201d he said in the recently released Nov. 16 interview.",

    "content": "The Real Vision Bot is known for outperforming the digital asset market, and its historic performance was recently labeled as \u201castonishing\u201d by Real Vision founder and macro guru Raoul Pal. Real Vision Bot has conducted a survey in a bid to come up with algorithmic portfolio assessments said to generate a \u201chive mind\u201d consensus. Real Vision Bot co-founded by quant analyst Moritz Seibert and statistician Moritz Heidena conducted a survey in a bid to come up with algorithmic portfolio assessments said to generate a \u201chive mind\u201d consensus. According to the results, the majority of the market participants voted to have a strong preference for Ethereum. Apart from Ethereum, the participants voted to overweight their portfolio with Polygon (Matic). The third asset on the participants\u2019 list is Bitcoin. The most surprising inclusion is Matic, which is the first-ever pick by the Real Vision Bot. Latest allocation of the free RealVision Exchange crypto portfolio and the Bot\u2019s choice. Polygon has taken the lead for the first time in the survey, followed by USDC, Ethereum, and AVAX. The Bot isn\u2019t that sure about the latter one and keeps ~10% in Bitcoin. The survey also disclosed Tether USD (USDT), followed by Avalanche (AVAX), Cosmos (ATOM), and Polkadot (DOT) are highly tipped to outperform the market. The crypto market has been underperforming for some time after the Terra and the FTX ecosystem collapse triggering a mass sell-off. The results of this survey indicate that there is a higher expectation that the market could bounce back. Ethereum records increasing unique addresses The Real Vision Bot is known for outperforming the digital asset market, and its historic performance was recently labeled as \u201castonishing\u201d by Real Vision founder and macro guru Raoul Pal. According to him, its record of outperforming the aggregated bucket of top 20 crypto assets by 20 percent is laudable. This is more interesting considering that it takes surveys from traders. In March, Real Vision Bot published its survey-based portfolio allocation which was led by Ethereum and followed by Bitcoin, Terra, Polygon, and Polkadot. Within the period, it observed that portfolios added to their Ethereum and Luna holdings and also added other assets in smaller portions. Latest allocation of the RealVision Exchange crypto portfolio. Both the Exchange and the Bot increase their allocation to Ethereum and Terra. Cardano and VeChain make it back into the allocation. Overall quite a diverse mix of smaller positions. Ethereum was tipped for a huge price gain after the merge. Even though the price has not seen any significant surge, the number of unique addresses keeps increasing. During the time of the Ethereum upgrade, the total number of unique addresses stood at 205,410,380. As of October 14, the figure was around 208,018,737. This indicates that people are showing interest as they explore the network. Regardless of these, Ethereum\u2019s social activity faced a decline after the merge, recording 8.46 million social mentions and 24.07 billion social engagements as of October 6.

    "description": "FTX exchange collapse sent shock waves through the cryptocurrency community, so how did it happen and why? The post FTX Exchange: One of the Largest Crypto Exchanges Collapses first appeared on StealthEX.",
    "content": "During the year 2022, the crypto industry went through a series of shocks that added to the overall negative market trend. First, the stunning fall of the Terra stablecoin that happened in May made the overall crypto market unstable, wiping out more than $200 billion in the space. In June, Celsius posted a memo informing users that it had frozen their assets, sending the price of Bitcoin and other cryptos down along with it. The latest controversy came just this November, when one of the largest crypto exchanges called FTX collapsed. So how did it happen with the FTX exchange and why? What Is FTX Exchange? FTX crypto exchange was a leading centralized cryptocurrency exchange specializing in derivatives and leveraged products. Sam Bankman-Fried founded FTX in May 2019, and FTX began within Alameda Research, a trading firm founded by Bankman-Fried, Caroline Ellison, and other former employees of Jane Street in 2017, in Berkeley, California. FTX offered a range of trading products, including derivatives, options, volatility products, and leveraged tokens. It also provided spot markets in more than 300 cryptocurrency trading pairs such as BTC/USDT, ETH/USDT, XRP/USDT, and its native token FTT/USDT.\u00a0 At its peak in July 2021, FTX had over one million users and was the third-largest cryptocurrency exchange by volume. FTX is incorporated in Antigua and Barbuda and headquartered in the Bahamas. The crypto exchange is closely associated with FTX.US, a separate exchange available to US residents. Bahamas-based FTX and its FTX US affiliate had overlapping management teams but separate capital structures. U.S. residents could only trade through FTX US. The firm was developing rapidly and entered a number of successful partnerships. Changpeng Zhao of Binance purchased a 20% stake in FTX for approximately $100 million, six months after Bankman-Fried started the firm. In July 2021, FTX raised $900 million at an $18 billion valuation from over 60 investors, including Softbank, Sequoia Capital, and other firms. Additionally, Bankman-Fried bought out Zhao\u2019s stake for approximately $2 billion. FTX mostly rose to popularity through a series of high-profile acquisitions, aggressive marketing strategies and low trading fees. Major venture capital groups also bought in, investing almost $2 billion in the company. FTX First Problems The broader crypto industry decline due to the overall market recession had already forced many major platforms to shut down, but FTX seemed immune, even buying up some of its struggling competitors.\u00a0 But things began to change earlier this month, when the balance sheet of a crypto investing firm that was also owned by Bankman-Fried, Alameda Research, was published by CoinDesk, a crypto-focused digital media website. It showed that Alameda held a large amount of a crypto token created by FTX called FTT. And though that FTT crypto held a certain market value, if the price were to drop, Alameda would be at risk of insolvency.\u00a0 FTT was minted by FTX exchange and given out as rewards to users. The FTT coin was also less transparent than other tokens, making it hard to track just how many tokens had been created. People could buy and sell FTT, but trading was relatively limited. Other platforms also held the token. The Scandal Around FTX Crypto Exchange and FTT Token After Alameda\u2019s balance sheet was leaked, Changpeng Zhao announced on November 6 that his company would sell off all its FTT tokens. The price of the FTT token dropped sharply. The leaked balance sheet provides more fodder for critics who say there is an unhealthy overlap between SBF\u2019s trading company and its exchange. But there was clearly more to Binance\u2019s decision to sell off his FTT tokens, as Zhao himself suggested. Meanwhile, as the price dropped, many FTX customers moved to withdraw their assets from the platform. Though the extent of the connections between Alameda and FTX were not yet public, a series of recent crypto platform collapses had already put the crypto community on edge. Those withdrawals would end up resembling a classic bank run, in which people worried about a bank\u2019s solvency rush to get their money out before it runs out of cash. Billions of dollars poured out of the platform. This sealed FTX\u2019s fate. On November 8, FTX stopped allowing customers to take money out of the platform. The Crisis and Its Aftermath Media organizations including Bloomberg, the Financial Times, The Wall Street Journal, and others cited anonymous sources saying that FTX needed $8 billion to cover the gap between what it owed and what it could pay out. NBC News has not verified those reports, and Bankman-Fried said in an interview that he needed to raise $8 billion in the next two weeks to make things right with account holders. Some sources reported that Alameda had used FTX funds for trading. According to a report, after the collapse of FTX, Sam Banksman-Fried stepped down as CEO and was reported to have moved to Argentina. Though these rumors may not be true, as he lives in Nassau, he was tweeting about his thoughts on the firm\u2019s crisis shortly after the event. Sam Bankman-Fried also confirmed that the exchange was using Alameda\u2019s bank accounts to wire customer deposits. Some customers were reportedly asked to wire their deposits through Alameda, which had a banking partnership with fintech bank Silvergate Capital. The collision between Alameda and FTX over the customer\u2019s fund later became the main point of failure. Bankman-Fried had claimed that even though FTX never gambled users\u2019 funds, it did loan them to Alameda. The former CEO claimed that he thought Alameda had enough collateral to back the loans, but as reports have suggested, a majority of it was in the native FTX token.\u00a0 What was once a $32 billion global empire has imploded in recent weeks. As a result, rival Binance had signed a letter of intent to buy FTX\u2019s international business as it faced a liquidity crunch.\u00a0 Down the Rabbit Hole As the story keeps unfolding, we learn more and more about the infamous crypto exchange and what Bankman-Fried has been up to. And this saga seems to be endless. All in all, Bankman-Fried saw the bulk of his net worth drop from $15.6 billion to $1 billion in a single day. This happened after news broke that his cryptocurrency exchange, FTX, needed a bailout. Now, it\u2019s come out that as much as $2 billion in customer funds are missing \u2013 and questions are arising over just how Bankman-Fried bankrolled his high-end lifestyle.\u00a0 According to a bankruptcy lawyer and Sullivan & Cromwell restructuring partner James Bromley, FTX spent around $300 million buying houses in the Bahamas for senior executives. Those lawyers are helping guide FTX through the bankruptcy process, where customers hope they can recover at least some of their funds after FTX filed for bankruptcy. Bromley said that the company had been run by \u2018a small group of inexperienced and unsophisticated individuals.\u2019 He added that the companies across the FTX network had \u2018unreliable books and records.\u2019 The FTX Group had 520 employees as of the end of October, including 330 employees across the globe registered at the US company, Bromley said. The latter has since fallen to around 260, he said. \u2018The whole operation was run by a gang of kids in the Bahamas,\u2019 a person familiar with the matter told one of the largest crypto sources. When his cryptocurrency exchange started teetering in early November, Sam Bankman-Fried went on Twitter to calm everyone down. A little-known figure outside crypto circles, Alameda\u2019s CEO Ms. Caroline Ellison claimed repeatedly that Mr. Bankman-Fried\u2019s empire was on stable financial footing. Conspiracy Theories The collapse has led some social media users to claim the cryptocurrency exchange was laundering U.S. aid sent to Ukraine and passing it along to Democrats to help with the midterm elections.\u00a0 It is true that Bankman-Fried has donated large sums to Democrats. Records show he and other FTX executives also have donated to conservative groups. As a matter of fact, Ukraine partnered with FTX when it launched a website allowing people to donate cryptocurrency to support the country, but multiple people involved have rejected the money-laundering claim. Ukraine\u2019s government \u2018never invested any funds into FTX,\u2019 Alex Bornyakov, the deputy minister of digital transformation in Ukraine said on Twitter. Vedant Patel, principal deputy spokesperson at the State Department, said \u2018monitoring mechanisms we have in place have not detected a deviation from the funds\u2019 expected use.\u2019 A spokesperson for the U.S. Agency for International Development said these safeguards put in place by the World Bank, coupled with expert third-party monitoring support within the Ukrainian government, ensure accountability around the use of the funds. However, despite the controversial statements, FTX and lawyers representing the company did not respond to requests for comment. Conclusion FTX\u2019s collapse sent shock waves through the crypto community. And even though the fate of the infamous crypto exchange is unknown, it\u2019s not too difficult to see that it\u2019ll take a long time for it to recover, if ever.

    "content": "About 140 million babies were born globally last year\u2014the equivalent of adding an entire new Russia to the world\u2019s population. Not counted among those typically blessed events are the number of families whose pregnancies end tragically. According to the United Nations Interagency Group for Child Mortality Estimation, about 2 million pregnancies around the world end in stillbirth each year. The causes of natal death are numerous\u2014from fetal abnormalities to labor complications to maternal hypertension to infections to placental malformation. Now, according to a new study in Nature Communications, there is another, particularly pernicious cause that may account for up to 39.7% of stillbirths in low- and middle-income countries: air pollution, specifically in the form of fine particles measuring 2.5 microns\u2014or millionths of a meter\u2014or less. The particles, about 3% of the width of a human hair, typically come from vehicle exhaust, the burning of coal and heating oil, and natural sources like wildfires. [time-brightcove not-tgx=\u201dtrue\u201d] According to the new research, led by environmental scientist and public health specialist Tao Xue at Peking University Health Science Center in Beijing, every 10 micrograms\u2014or millionth of a gram\u2014of so-called PM2.5 particles per cubic meter of air increases the risk of stillbirth by 11%, with the toll greater on older mothers than younger ones. \u201cThe United Nations calls the global burden of stillbirths a neglected tragedy,\u201d the paper\u2019s authors write. \u201cPreventing stillbirths depends on a comprehensive understanding of the underlying risk factors.\u201d The World Health Organization (WHO) has established a so-called reference level\u2014or maximum safe exposure\u2014of PM2.5 at 5 micrograms per cubic meter of air. Above that level, the particles can contribute to heart disease, asthma, decreased lung function, and premature death in people with pre-existing heart or lung disease. Researchers have long drawn a potential link between PM2.5 exposure and stillbirth, but what they hadn\u2019t done, until Tao and his colleagues took the topic on, is to study how the burden falls disproportionately on people in poorer countries. According to the World Bank, the average global concentration of PM2.5 is an alarming 46 micrograms per cubic meter\u2014or nine times the WHO\u2019s reference level. But the burden is not spread equally. In Australia, it\u2019s a more tolerable 9 micrograms; in Canada, it\u2019s just six. The Bahamas clocks in at just 5.58. It\u2019s elsewhere, in the less developed world, that the pollution problem hits the hardest. To conduct their study, the investigators selected 137 low- and middle-income countries in which data from the Department of Health Surveys (DHS), a division of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), show are home to 98% of the world\u2019s incidence of stillbirths. They cross-indexed those mortality figures with other data from the WHO\u2019s Air Quality Guidelines detailing the severity of PM2.5 pollution in each of those countries. The results drew a bright line between the particulate emissions and the incidence of stillbirths. India, the hardest-hit country, with an annual average of 217,000 stillbirths (out of 25 million live births), had a PM2.5 concentration of 60.15 micrograms per cubic meter of air\u2014or 12 times the WHO\u2019s reference level. Pakistan, the second most severely affected country, with 110,000 stillbirths per year (compared to 6.075 million live births), weighed in at 63.16 micrograms of pollution. Following them were Nigeria (93,000 stillbirths, 7.8 million live births, and 69.66 micrograms); China (64,000 stillbirths, 10,6 million live births, and 51.11 micrograms), and Bangladesh (49,000 stillbirths, 2.8 million live births, and 69.58 micrograms). In addition to PM2.5 air pollution, the study also cites the possibility of naturally occurring high concentrations of dust\u2014particularly in sub-Saharan Africa and the Arabian Desert region\u2014as another source of dangerous particles. Maternal age played a significant role in the mortality risk. Relying on DHS data, as well as two existing meta-analyses of stillbirth incidence, the researchers calculated that mothers who lost their children at birth were, on average, 3.81 years older than those whose babies were born successfully. The greatest risk of stillbirth in high PM2.5 countries was among mothers ages 34 years or older. Just what the mechanism is that links PM2.5 concentration to stillbirth is uncertain. \u201cAlthough potential biological mechanisms for the association of PM2.5 exposure and pregnancy loss are not clear yet,\u201d the researchers wrote, \u201csome pathways can explain it to some extent.\u201d The researchers propose three possibilities. First, when a pregnant person inhales PM2.5 particles, they enter the bloodstream and may directly cross the placental barrier where they flow into the fetus, leading to low oxygen levels or immune problems in the baby, both of which can be associated with fetal death. There is also the possibility that exposure to PM2.5 can lead to the development of methemoglobin in the parent\u2014a form of hemoglobin that does not bind with oxygen and thus does not deliver sufficient quantities of oxygen to the fetus, also leading to immune problems and potentially death in the womb. Finally, PM2.5 can lead to abnormalities or malformations in the placenta itself, preventing it from sustaining a fetus throughout pregnancy. The outlook was not entirely bleak. The study notes that the global stillbirth rate actually decreased by 1.95% from 2000 to 2009, and fell again by 2.05% from 2009 to 2019. It attributes the trend to improved air quality in multiple countries\u201a notably China, that are taking slow steps away from coal-fired power plants and cleaning up their power grid with renewable sources of energy. In the meantime, pregnant people can take steps to reduce their exposure to PM2.5 pollution and better monitor the potential impact of the particles. Wearing N95 or KN95 masks outdoors on heavily polluted days, avoiding the outdoors when air quality is at its worst, and installing air purifiers in the home can all help. So too can improvements in prenatal care and timely intervention\u2014including cesarean sections\u2014in the case of premature or complicated labor. Pregnancy and childbirth have never been easy. But more often than they do now, they should result in a happy outcome. In 137 countries at least, our own poor stewardship of the health of the planet is too often denying families that joy.",

    "content": "A Eufy security camera, from Anker. | Image: Anker/Eufy Anker has built a remarkable reputation for quality over the past decade, building its phone charger business into an empire spanning all sorts of portable electronics \u2014 including the Eufy home security cameras we\u2019ve recommended over the years. Eufy\u2019s commitment to privacy is remarkable: it promises your data will be stored locally, that it \u201cnever leaves the safety of your home,\u201d that its footage only gets transmitted with \u201cend-to-end\u201d military-grade encryption, and that it will only send that footage \u201cstraight to your phone.\u201d So you can imagine our surprise to learn you can stream video from a Eufy camera, from the other side of the country, with no encryption at all. Screenshot by Sean Hollister / The Verge Part of Anker\u2019s Eufy \u201cprivacy commitment\u201d. Worse, it\u2019s not yet clear how widespread this might be \u2014 because instead of addressing it head-on, the company falsely claimed to The Verge that it wasn\u2019t even possible. On Thanksgiving Day, infosec consultant Paul Moore and a hacker who goes by Wasabi both alleged that Anker\u2019s Eufy cameras can stream encryption-free through the cloud \u2014 just by connecting to a unique address at Eufy\u2019s cloud servers with the free VLC Media Player. Ah well, the cats out the bag now... so may as well tell you.You can remotely start a stream and watch @EufyOfficial cameras live using VLC. No authentication, no encryption.Please don't ask for a PoC - I can't release this one.Heads up @TechLinkedYT @LinusTech https://t.co/sU3FyRaELX\u2014 Paul Moore (@Paul_Reviews) November 25, 2022 When we asked Anker point-blank to confirm or deny that, the company categorically denied it. \u201cI can confirm that it is not possible to start a stream and watch live footage using a third-party player such as VLC,\u201d Brett White, a senior PR manager at Anker, told me via email. But The Verge can now confirm that\u2019s not true. This week, we repeatedly watched live footage from two of our own Eufy cameras using that very same VLC media player, from across the United States \u2014 proving that Anker has a way to bypass encryption and access these supposedly secure cameras through the cloud. There is some good news: there\u2019s no proof yet that this has been exploited in the wild, and the way we initially obtained the address required logging in with a username and password before Eufy\u2019s website will cough up the encryption-free stream. (We\u2019re not sharing the exact technique here.) Also, it seems like it only works on cameras that are awake. We had to wait until our floodlight camera detected a passing car, or its owner pressed a button, before the VLC stream came to life. Your camera\u2019s 16-digit serial number \u2014 likely visible on the box \u2014 is the biggest part of the key But it also gets worse: Eufy\u2019s best practices appear to be so shoddy that bad actors might be able to figure out the address of a camera\u2019s feed \u2014 because that address largely consists of your camera\u2019s serial number encoded in Base64, something you can easily reverse with a simple online calculator. The address also includes a Unix timestamp you can easily create, a token that Eufy\u2019s servers don\u2019t actually seem to be validating (we changed our token to \u201carbitrarypotato\u201d and it still worked), and a four-digit random hex whose 65,536 combinations could easily be brute forced. \u201cThis is definitely not how it should be designed,\u201d Mandiant vulnerability engineer Jacob Thompson tells The Verge. For one thing, serial numbers don\u2019t change, so a bad actor could give or sell or donate a camera to Goodwill and quietly keep watching the feeds. But also, he points out that companies don\u2019t tend to keep their serial numbers secret. Some stick them right on the box they sell at Best Buy \u2014 yes, including Eufy. On the plus side, Eufy\u2019s serial numbers are long at 16 characters and aren\u2019t just an increasing number. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to be able to just guess at IDs and begin hitting them,\u201d says Mandiant Red Team consultant Dillon Franke, calling it a possible \u201csaving grace\u201d of this disclosure. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t sound quite as bad as if it\u2019s UserID 1000, then you try 1001, 1002, 1003.\u201d It could be worse. When Georgia Tech security researcher and Ph.D. candidate Omar Alrawi was studying poor, smart home practices in 2018, he saw some devices substituting their own MAC address for security \u2014 even though a MAC address is only twelve characters long, and you can generally figure out the first six characters just by knowing which company made a gadget, he explains. \u201cThe serial number now becomes critical to keep secret.\u201d But we also don\u2019t know how else these serial numbers might leak, or if Eufy might even unwittingly provide them to anyone who asks. \u201cSometimes there are APIs that will return some of that unique ID information,\u201d says Franke. \u201cThe serial number now becomes critical to keep secret, and I don\u2019t think they\u2019d treat it that way.\u201d Thompson also wonders whether there are other potential attack vectors now that we know Eufy\u2019s cameras aren\u2019t wholly encrypted: \u201cIf the architecture is such that they can order the camera to start streaming at any time, anyone with admin access has the ability to access the IT infrastructure and watch your camera,\u201d he warns. That\u2019s a far cry from Anker\u2019s claim that footage is \u201csent straight to your phone\u2014and only you have the key.\u201d By the way, there are other worrying signs that Anker\u2019s security practices may be much, much poorer than it has let on. This whole saga started when infosec consultant Moore started tweeting accusations that Eufy had violated other security promises, including uploading thumbnail images (including faces) to the cloud without permission and failing to delete stored private data. Anker reportedly admitted to the former, but called it a misunderstanding. You have some serious questions to answer @EufyOfficial Here is irrefutable proof that my supposedly \"private\", \"stored locally\", \"transmitted only to you\" doorbell is streaming to the cloud - without cloud storage enabled.#privacyhttps://t.co/u4iGgkWkJB\u2014 Paul Moore (@Paul_Reviews) November 23, 2022 Most worrying if true, he also claims that Eufy\u2019s encryption key for its video footage is literally just the plaintext string \u201cZXSecurity17Cam@\u201d. That phrase also appears in a GitHub repo from 2019, too. Anker didn\u2019t answer The Verge\u2019s straightforward yes-or-no question about whether \u201cZXSecurity17Cam@\u201d is the encryption key. We couldn\u2019t get more details from Moore, either; he told The Verge he can\u2019t comment further now that he\u2019s started legal proceedings against Anker. Now that Anker has been caught in some big lies, it\u2019s going to be hard to trust whatever the company says next \u2014 but for some, it may be important to know which cameras do and do not behave this way, whether anything will be changed, and when. When Wyze had a vaguely similar vulnerability, it swept it under the rug for three years; hopefully, Anker will do far, far better. Some may not be willing to wait or trust anymore. \u201cIf I came across this news and had this camera inside my home, I\u2019d immediately turn it off and not use it, because I don\u2019t know who can view it and who cannot,\u201d Alrawi tells me. Wasabi, the security engineer who showed us how to get a Eufy camera\u2019s network address, says he\u2019s ripping all of his out. \u201cI bought these because I was trying to be security conscious!\u201d he exclaims. With some specific Eufy cams, you could perhaps try switching them to use Apple\u2019s HomeKit Secure Video instead. With reporting and testing by Jen Tuohy and Nathan Edwards",

    "description": "Despite positives, Avalanche may struggle to fit this list",
    "content": "Contents Avalanche token also has many advantages Why hasn\u2019t cryptocurrency skyrocketed even though it has all those benefits? (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Does Avalanche (AVAX) have a chance to become the great \u201cEthereum Killer?\u201d The altcoin has the fundamentals to stand out on the market, but how far can this make Avalanche grow? Avalanche's main purpose is to be a peer competitor to Ethereum (ETH). Therefore, it already discards with its network the main problems that are found on the main altcoin on the market, such as high fees and a slow network. Avalanche promises to make 4,500 transactions per second, compared to ETH, which makes just 14 in the same period. But within the category of \u201cEthereum Killer,\u201d all Ethereum competitors have the aforementioned qualities. However, Avalanche has other important highlights that make it a serious contender. window.coinzilla_display = window.coinzilla_display || []; var c_display_preferences = {}; c_display_preferences.zone = \"5335d7792eb489ae565\"; c_display_preferences.width = \"300\"; c_display_preferences.height = \"250\"; coinzilla_display.push(c_display_preferences); Ads window.coinzilla_display = window.coinzilla_display || []; var c_display_preferences = {}; c_display_preferences.zone = \"5335d7792eb489ae565\"; c_display_preferences.width = \"300\"; c_display_preferences.height = \"250\"; coinzilla_display.push(c_display_preferences); Ads Its scalability, for example, is possible, as the altcoin has three individual blockchains with different purposes: X-Chain: Decentralized platform for creating and trading smart digital assets; C-Chain: Allows the creation of smart contracts; P-Chain: Coordinates validators, tracks active subnets and allows the creation of new subnets. It is worth mentioning that Avalanche's consensus mechanism is differentiated according to its use cases. Additionally, the altcoin has been working on interoperability between its blockchain and Ethereum. Avalanche token also has many advantages When a user transacts with AVAX, the transaction fee is burned, bringing scarcity to the altcoin. Furthermore, the token is used to secure the network through the staking process, pay fees and provide a basic unit of accounting between the various subnets created on the Avalanche platform. Another point is that AVAX has an impressive performance in platform economics. This is because Avalanche offers a variety of services, such as peer-to-peer lending, trading and creating subnets. All of these require the developer to have AVAX to enjoy them. Why hasn\u2019t cryptocurrency skyrocketed even though it has all those benefits? First, it is possible to mention that the hype of Ethereum competitors did not last long. The emergence of ETH 2.0 makes the existence of an \u201cEthereum Killer\u201d questionable. In addition, Avalanche has many rivals that also have positive highlights, such as Polkadot (DOT) and Cardano (ADA). The high amount invested to become a cryptocurrency validator is also a significant negative. With altcoins like ADA , for example, you do not have to be an investment whale to earn passive income from staking; AVAX requiring at least 2,000 tokens to be an Avalanche validator is self-defeating. The amount of tokens mentioned represents an investment of USD $24,000 at the time of writing. Even with the major market correction that Avalanche went through, without a doubt, it is not an investment that any investor can make. Scalability solutions and Ethereum finalizing its transition to version 2.0, where the altcoin, according to Vitalik Buterin, will make 100,000 transactions per second, may end Avalanche's promise of prominence on the market, even with its positive points.",

    "content": "Crypto Twitter wasn't in the room where it happened, but the chattering class on the birdsite had plenty of thoughts about Sam Bankman-Fried's one-on-one interview with Andrew Ross Sorkin as part of a New York Times conference. The Dealbook Summit is an annual event hosted by the Times . and the session moderator Andrew Ross Sorkin is an award-winning journalist, CNBC anchor, and author of \"Too Big to Fail,\" the story of the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the 2008 financial crisis. Sorkin is also the co-creator of the Showtime series Billions and the founder of Dealbook. Sorkin asked Bankman-Fried if his lawyers suggested speaking at the conference was a good idea. \"No,\u201d Bankman-Fried replied. \u201cThey are very much not,\" adding that he felt he had a duty to speak.

    "content": "The world of can be confusing and even a little scary. With so many new companies, technologies, and laws coming into play every day, it\u2019s easy to get lost in the details. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve put together this list of countries where cryptocurrency is legal and illegal worldwide. By the end of this article, you\u2019ll have all the information you need about which nations are on board with crypto\u2014and which ones aren\u2019t! The laws and regulations surrounding cryptocurrency vary greatly from country to country. For example, some nations have taken an accommodating stance on digital currency transactions, while others have imposed strict regulations or even banned cryptocurrencies altogether. This means that whether something is legal or illegal depends largely on where you are located. In the United States, for example, cryptocurrency is legal as long as it\u2019s used for transaction purposes and not for investment speculation. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has issued guidance stating that \u201cvirtual currencies held by taxpayers as a capital asset may be taxed as property\u201d. Consequently, individuals must pay taxes on gains they make from trading digital currencies like . Other countries, such as China, have taken a more restrictive approach and prohibited banks from engaging in any crypto-related activities; while other nations such as Japan are still in the process of developing a legal framework to govern virtual currencies. When it comes to cryptocurrencies, there is one thing you can say with certainty: they are functional everywhere. Cryptocurrency is a virtual form of payment available in every country in the world. Bitcoin is the most popular cryptocurrency and has been used as a method of payment by many businesses since it was introduced in 2009. The key to understanding why this is true is understanding what cryptocurrencies really are and how they work. Cryptocurrencies are decentralized currencies that are not backed by any government or central bank (unlike traditional currencies). This means that even if your government bans cryptocurrency or makes its use illegal, you will still be able to trade them at other exchanges located outside your country\u2019s jurisdiction (and vice versa). Cryptocurrency is legal in some form or another in 123 countries. These include the United States, which has a clear stance on cryptocurrency. On the other side of things are countries like Venezuela, whose citizens have been arrested for mining cryptocurrencies and Ecuador, where mining is considered money laundering and can result in up to eight years in prison. Not only are certain countries banning cryptocurrency, but they are also making it a criminal activity. This means that if you are caught with crypto in one of these countries, you could be arrested and even jailed. The following list is a compilation of the 9 countries where cryptocurrency is illegal or criminal: There are currently a number of countries without a clear stance on cryptocurrency, or where regulations have not yet been put into place. This generally means that there is an implicit ban (financial institutions are not allowed to take on crypto clients) regarding cryptocurrencies in these places. These include: Tax regulations related to cryptocurrencies also vary depending on which jurisdiction you\u2019re in. In some countries, digital currencies are considered commodities for tax purposes and are thus subject to capital gains taxes; whereas in other places they may be treated differently depending on how they\u2019re used and whether or not they\u2019re classified as an investment instrument or a currency itself. Taxpayers must familiarize themselves with the applicable laws and regulations of their local jurisdiction to ensure compliance with taxation laws when trading digital currencies. Due to their decentralized nature and lack of regulation across international borders, government interventions have become both necessary and frequent within the crypto market. Some countries have imposed bans or restrictions on cryptocurrency usage within their borders; while others have implemented measures to protect investors against scams or fraudulent activities involving digital assets. This can range from requiring companies dealing with virtual currencies to register with the appropriate authorities, to setting up dedicated agencies that monitor crypto trading activity within certain jurisdictions. When it comes to enforcing laws surrounding cryptocurrencies due to their decentralized nature and lack of a central authority overseeing them across all jurisdictions internationally- there exist certain challenges which law enforcement agencies face when attempting to hold individuals accountable for illegal activities carried out using digital assets. This includes difficulties verifying ownership of virtual coins or , tracking suspicious transactions made through anonymous wallets, determining jurisdictional boundaries of applicable laws among different countries involved in a particular transaction etc. The legal status of cryptocurrency varies substantially from country to country and is still undefined or changing in many of them. While some countries have explicitly allowed their use and trade, others have banned or restricted it. Similarly, various government agencies, departments, and courts have classified Bitcoin differently. While this article provides the legal status of bitcoin worldwide, laws can always change. As such it is important to ask your local government regulators for up-to-date information on their position regarding bitcoin before starting a project that will use Bitcoin as a payment method. In conclusion, it is clear that cryptocurrency is legal in some form or another throughout most of the world. However, there are still some countries where it is not legal yet or there is no clear stance on how to regulate this new type of currency. The countries where cryptocurrency has been banned altogether include China while others like Venezuela are considering following suit.",

Although the FCA is taking steps to reduce the risk, about 80% of the market participants are losing money, and some brokers are still not complying with the set guidelines. </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">According to the accompanying press release, the FCA's action stopped 24 firms from <a href=\"https://www.financemagnates.com/terms/m/marketing/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"48d4594c-de24-47ac-9f1b-aa2e0da8374a_1\" class=\"terms__secondary-term\">marketing</a> CFDs in the UK in the last two years. Activities undertaken in the previous year alone prevented \u00a3100 million in financial harm. </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">The FCA notes that 'poor practices' refers to only a small percentage of firms, especially those offering their services to the UK from overseas. In the worst cases, the regulator has identified instances of false advertising involving celebrities, aggressive sales tactics and investment advice offerings without proper authorization. Dishonest operating companies try to force consumers to deposit large sums of money, often beyond their financial capacity and level of risk aversion.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\"We have set out the standards we expect CFD firms to demonstrate in order to protect consumers and ensure market integrity. CFD providers authorised in our regime must sell products appropriately, and when the new consumer duty comes into effect, will need to ensure that products deliver good outcomes for retail consumers. We will not hesitate to take swift and assertive action where we identify harm,\" Sarah Pritchard, the Executive Director of Markets at the FCA, commented.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">The <a href=\"https://www.financemagnates.com/tag/fca/\" target=\"_blank\">FCA </a>expects all companies which received the letter to take appropriate action on the concerns raised by January 2023.</p><p>Ongoing Focus on the CFD Sector</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">The FCA's increased activity in the CFD sector stems from the wider Consumer Investments strategy. The triyearly plan was <a href=\"https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/corporate-documents/consumer-investments-strategy\">published</a> in mid-September and aims to create a consumer investment market in which trading can be made with an understanding of the risks involved, with access to the regulator's protection and confidence.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">In October, the regulator <a href=\"https://www.financemagnates.com/forex/fca-stops-16-suspected-cfds-providers/\">published data on consumer harm</a> from 1 April 2021 to 31 March 2022. As part of its ongoing efforts, the FCA stopped 33 consumer investment firms and saved traders from multimillion-dollar losses.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Last week, the FCA drew attention to <a href=\"https://www.financemagnates.com/forex/fca-warns-trading-app-operators-to-stop-the-trading-gamification/\">excessive gamification</a> in the retail investment industry. It issued a warning to trading app developers, saying they need to take a different approach to app design and reduce incentives that can lead to excessive trading.</p> This article was written by Damian Chmiel at www.financemagnates.com.",

    "description": "The European Central Bank put out a blog yesterday heavily maligning Bitcoin. Rarely being used for legal transactions was one its allegations. The European Central Bank (ECB) published a blog on Wednesday where it said that the number one cryptocurrency was on the \u201croad to irrelevance\u201d. The report pulled no punches and was scathing of Bitcoin. Bitcoin is rarely used for legal transactions\u00a0 Authors Ulrich Bindseil and J\u00fcrgen Schaaf included the above subtitle in their report but then made absolutely no reference at all to it within. There was no on-chain data or links to it in the text so it was left to the reader to believe the claim or not. According to blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis, illegal activity on the Bitcoin blockchain made up only 0.15% of the total transaction volume for the year 2021, which is the lowest it has ever been. Therefore the ECB author\u2019s use of such a subtitle might be taken as misleading in the extreme. The illegal transactions section of the ECB blog article was mainly filled with making the case that in the author\u2019s view, the value of Bitcoin was based purely on speculation, and that speculative bubbles were caused by new waves of investors coming in. Regulation can be misunderstood as approval The blog authors wanted to leave no doubt that regulation, when it arrives, does not give crypto any more legitimacy. They deplored the fact that large investors were funding lobbyists, who were in their turn trying to influence lawmakers. The fact that this is how the legislative process works for every single new piece of legislation, crypto or not, did not appear to make a difference. The slow speed of regulation, and the inability for all jurisdictions to agree on it was another area that the ECB complained about. That Bitcoin was perceived by the ECB to be an \u201cunprecedented polluter\u201d, was also shoe-horned into the regulation section. The claim was made that Bitcoin \u201cconsumes energy on the scale of entire economies\u201d.\u00a0 However, the comparisons did not include the banking industry. In an article from 2021, Bitcoin Magazine estimated that Bitcoin emitted 70 million Mt of CO2 annually, while bank branches and ATMs produced 400 million Mt each year. Promoting Bitcoin is a reputational risk for banks To end its blog article the ECB posited that Bitcoin was not suitable for payments nor as an investment, and therefore should not be seen as legitimised by regulation. Those in the financial industry were warned as to the reputational damage they could incur by promoting Bitcoin investments for short-term profits. It was felt that as Bitcoin will make further losses, the negative impact on banks that supported cryptocurrency might tarnish the whole banking industry. Of course, it might be wondered just how much more negativity could even be inflicted on the banking industry, given that it has been riddled with fraud and manipulation over many decades. Just for the year 2020 many hundreds of millions of dollars were paid in fines for misconduct by some of the biggest banks and financial institutions. In that year Wells Fargo alone had to pay $3 billion in fines for \u201chistoric account fraud stretching back years.\u201d Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Our HUGE staking dev update is LIVE!!! LOTS of NEW Token, NFT, Space, and performance features. $SOON holders begin staking your tokens TODAY. First reward happens on Dec 8th. LFGO! @shimmernet @iotahttps://t.co/Id4MSX7SXS pic.twitter.com/tqQsGjRw6m \u2014 SoonLabs | Soonaverse.com (@soon_labs) December 1, 2022 The Soonaverse platform allows communities to build NFT marketplaces, decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), projects, companies, etc. by leveraging the feeless infrastructure of the IOTA network. Earlier in September, Soonaverse had tested the minting of NFTs on the Shimmer blockchain network. While introducing its new staking feature, Soonaverse said: NFT creators will be happy to hear that they no longer need a badge to make a collection now that $SOON staking results in an anti-spamming mechanism. Users interested in staking their $SOON coins will have to do it for a minimum period of one week and it can go all the way up to 52 weeks. As users stake their $SOON tokens, they get locked. This staking and locking mechanism is unique to the Shimmer network. For staking, users won\u2019t need to send their tokens to a smart contract. Instead, they just need to specify the number of tokens they want to stake and the duration involved. These tokens shall appear automatically in your wallet with a time expiry condition. Despite staking the $SOON tokens, they remain 100% in the user\u2019s control. Interestingly, Soonaverse will offer 2x rewards if users stake their tokens for 52 weeks. Better NFT and token rankings After receiving some quality feedback on the NFT collections on Sonnaverse, they have now improved the sorting mechanism. This includes adding things like getting \u201cspaces with the most members\u201d at the top of the discovery page. This will give the popular collections greater visibility and the first impression as users land on the site. Interestingly, Soonaverse brings a greater level of decentralization to how tokens are ordered on their respective pages. This shall happen via a community-driven ranking system. Users who have staked the native $SOON tokens can either upvote or downvote collections and tokens in the Soonaverse. Soonaverse said that this will bring the most reputable projects to the top offering their greater visibility to its users. It added that: Guardians of a new ranking moderator space will then be able to use the upvote / downvote information to rate the collection or token on a scale of -100 to 100. The cumulative score of all guardians rankings will determine the order the collection or token shows up on its discovery page. Soonaverse said that it is working on a system that functions and manages different processes like decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs).

In a Dec. 1 hearing of the Senate Agriculture Committee exploring the collapse of FTX, Behnam said LedgerX had essentially been \u201cwalled off\u201d from many of the companies within FTX Group \u2014 including those that filed for bankruptcy \u2014 that provided a regulatory window for the CFTC. The CFTC chair said LedgerX was \u201chealthy\u201d, \u201csolvent\u201d, and \u201coperational\u201d compared to other FTX entities. \u201cThe limitations of our authority stopped at [LedgerX],\u201d said Behnam. \u201cFor those same reasons that we were walled off from going past the regulated entity, the other FTX entities were not able to pierce through LedgerX and potentially take customer money, which obviously, as a regulator, is the priority.\u201d In his written testimony for the hearing, the CFTC chair said : Behnan added that FTX had reported LedgerX held \u201cmore cash than all the other FTX debtor entities combined\u201d in its bankruptcy filings. The CFTC chair, committee chair Michigan Senator Debbie Stabenow and ranking member Arkansas Senator John Boozman pointed to the Digital Commodities Consumer Protection Act , or DCCPA, as a potential solution to the events leading up to FTX\u2019s insolvency, which left many U.S. consumers in the lurch. \u201cThe crypto industry lacks the customer protections that Americans expect and deserve,\u201d said Stabenow. \u201cWhen trading in U.S. markets, when exchanges accept customer funds for trading they must not be allowed to gamble with those funds [...] FTX did all of those things, emboldened by a lack of federal oversight.\u201d Related: US senators commit to advancing crypto bill despite FTX collapse Since filing for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 in the District of Delaware, FTX has been the target of global regulators and lawmakers investigating the exchange, including Turkey\u2019s Financial Crimes Investigation Agency, authorities in the Bahamas and U.S. state and federal authorities. The U.S. House Financial Services Committee scheduled a hearing to investigate the events around the collapse of the crypto exchange on Dec. 13, and the next court hearing in the bankruptcy case has been scheduled for Dec. 16.",

    "content": "Mazars\u2019 US division has long served as the accounting firm for former US President Donald Trump\u2019s company. Binance is collaborating with accounting firm Mazars as part of its proof-of-reserve (PoR) audits, which have been triggered by the fall of FTX. According to the Wall Street Journal, Mazars, the accounting firm that worked for former US President Donald Trump\u2019s company, has been appointed as an official auditor to conduct a \u201cthird party financial verification\u201d as part of Binance\u2019s PoR updates. According to a spokesperson for Binance, the accounting firm is already reviewing all of Binance\u2019s publicly shared information on Bitcoin BTC tickers down $16,986 PoR and will also be verifying future updates and tokens. \u201cThe first BTC verification update will be completed this week,\u201d said the representative. Mazars is a Paris-based international accounting firm. Mazars USA, Trump\u2019s longtime accounting firm, had been embroiled in a dispute with the House Oversight and Reform Committee over a request for some of Trump\u2019s financial records since 2019. According to reports, the firm will cut ties with Trump and his family in 2022. The announcement comes as Binance conducts PoR audits on large amounts of cryptocurrency. Binance sent 127,351 BTC, or approximately $2 billion, to an unknown wallet on November 28, with CEO Changpeng \u201cCZ\u201d Zhao later announcing that the transaction was part of the ongoing PoR process. The action has raised some eyebrows in the community, as CZ previously stated that it is bad news when exchanges must move large amounts of cryptocurrency to prove their wallet address. As previously reported, Binance launched a PoR process and mechanism in response to the FTX crypto exchange\u2019s crash and bankruptcy. On November 25, the company also released Merkle Tree-backed proof of funds for Bitcoin. Binance is not alone in making significant efforts to maintain customer trust in the aftermath of the FTX collapse, with many other exchanges, including OKX and KuCoin, rushing to release their PoR reports as well. Meanwhile, some industry observers believe that the current PoR process used by exchanges is largely ineffective unless they also provide liabilities that are difficult to forge.

    "description": "Many observers say the blank sheets represent everything protesters wish they could say but cannot.",
    "content": "A s protests against Xi Jinping\u2019s Zero-COVID policy spread across China\u2019s diverse cities and regions over the last week, one symbol remained constant: a blank sheet of paper. On a bridge in Beijing, dozens of protesters held sheets of blank paper aloft, as gridlocked cars below contributed toward a cacophony of horns\u2014described in captions on social media, where several videos of the event went viral, as expressions of support. And on a road in Shanghai that has become a symbolic center of the protest movement, police attempted to disperse hundreds of protesters on Sunday\u2014some of whom were holding blank sheets of paper, Reuters reported . China\u2019s first major protests in years began last week as an expression of dissent against China\u2019s strict zero-COVID policy, which has left the country oscillating through cycles of lockdowns even as much of the rest of the world returns to a semblance of normality. The spark appeared to be a fire in a tower block in the city of Urumqi, in the northwest Xinjiang region, which killed 10 people. The victims are rumored to have been unable to escape due to a strict COVID lockdown in which people were locked into their apartments, although the Chinese government denies this. The protests are the most sustained since the student protest movement of 1989 that was brutally suppressed when security forces massacred students at Tiananmen Square in Beijing, leaving hundreds or even thousands dead. Under President Xi, protests have become increasingly rare in China. His rule has been marked by an uptick in forms of social control like AI-enhanced surveillance and heavy police crackdowns on dissent. But already, the protests that began as dissent against Xi\u2019s zero-COVID policy appear to be morphing, at least for some, into a wider protest against authoritarianism. In Shanghai, a man holding a flower at a gathering of protesters was arrested by police after he questioned other arrests and referred to the fire in Urumqi. \u201cWe must be brave,\u201d the man could be heard telling the crowd in videos shared on social media, before being bundled into a vehicle. The blank sheet of paper has become so pervasive that, online, people have begun referring to the protests in China as the \u201cA4 revolution\u201d\u2014a reference to the standard paper size used in printers\u2014or \u201cwhite paper revolution.\u201d Many observers have described the paper as a representation of everything protesters wish they could say but cannot. It presents authorities with a difficult conundrum: arrest people for saying literally nothing at all or allow a simple act of resistance to proliferate unchallenged. In the social media age, the blank sheet has the added benefit of being difficult for online censors to quickly block at scale without accidentally censoring many other innocuous images or videos. Read More: Zero-COVID Protests in China Have Rattled Global Markets A global symbol against censorship The A4 sheet of paper has a longer history as a symbol of protest globally. Protesters in Hong Kong held up blank sheets of paper in 2020 in protest against the restrictive National Security Law that increased Beijing\u2019s power over the semi-autonomous enclave . In Russia earlier this year, protesters opposing the Kremlin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine were arrested for holding up blank sheets of paper amid a government crackdown on dissent. Those arrests only sparked further outrage online. The tactic was echoed by protesters in the U.K. demonstrating against a new draft law partially restricting the right to protest, drawing comparisons between the U.K. and more authoritarian states like Russia. The blank sheet of paper also confounds online censors in places like China and Russia, where online discussion is restricted. In China, where online censorship is especially sophisticated, social media platforms like WeChat, Weibo, and Douyin use a combination of human reviewers and AI to remove videos of protests. Access to the global internet beyond China\u2019s \u201cgreat firewall,\u201d where information about the protests is spreading more freely, is blocked. But by adopting previously benign items as their symbols, protesters reduce the applicability of AI systems, which can take engineers long amounts of time to adjust to reliably detect new symbols. Human censors must work overtime to fill the gap by removing photos and videos\u2014meaning there\u2019s a greater chance of some content slipping through and inspiring others. But like any potent form of political symbolism, the A4 sheet of paper might obscure as much as it reveals. \u201cThe demonstrators have broad slogans,\u201d tweeted Nathan Law, an activist who played a leading role in the 2019-2020 protest movement in Hong Kong, who is now living in self-imposed exile in London. Political opinion in China is varied, with many protesters clearly upset at zero-COVID policies but not necessarily the government as a whole. \u201cA blank sheet of paper with various expressions is unavoidable in this movement,\u201d Law wrote in a follow-up tweet . \u201cBecause the conditions for broad mass consensus \u2026 do not exist.\u201d \u2014 With additional reporting by Man Sum Lai.

    "description": "The fully-regulated NFT platform lets users buy NFT shares of a racehorse syndicate that maps to one horse, or a collection of horses.",
    "content": "The horse racing industry has ballooned to an astonishing $300 billion globally\u2014and now NFT-backed horse ownership platform Crown Ribbon is bringing that value onto the blockchain. Crown Ribbon enables users to buy and own NFT shares of a racehorse syndicate that maps to a specific horse, or to a collection of horses. The introduction of blockchain technology will increase efficiencies in the \u201cnotoriously slow and monotonous\u201d equine industry, according to a statement from Crown Ribbon accompanying its launch announcement. In particular, NFTs will enable holders to trace and transfer ownership and authentication rights over their shares easily, and bring these valuable assets on-chain. \u201cFor many racers, their horse is their most valuable possession, more valuable than their home and vehicles,\u201d said Doug Leonard, CEO of fixed-rate lending protocol Hifi , which has partnered with performance horse industry veteran Chad Beus to launch Crown Ribbon. \u201cTapping into that value through traditional means isn\u2019t an option.\u201d Crown Ribbon, Leonard added, is \u201cwell-positioned to disrupt this antiquated horse racing industry through blockchain technology, by offering a new ownership paradigm that comes with greater flexibility and tooling.\u201d Fully-regulated NFT ownership Crown Ribbon states that it is regulated and transparent, with the platform\u2019s offering qualified by the SEC under Regulation A+, making the platform compliant with SEC regulation for U.S. participants. And through Hifi\u2019s involvement with the platform, Crown Ribbon members will gain access to the lending protocol\u2019s ecosystem of liquidity products, a worldwide audience, and broader DeFi composability. \u201cEven for the best racing operations, traditional financial institutions lack the experience and expertise to underwrite these non-standard assets,\u201d said Leonard. \u201cBecause of our partnership with industry leaders at Crown Ribbon, Hifi gains access to the necessary experience and expertise to effectively underwrite these real world assets.\u201d To learn more about Crown Ribbon and its NFT-backed horses, visit www.crownribbon.io .

Speaking in an analysis video, AltcoinSherpa stated that in his opinion, the three tokens appear to be the best coins to hold in the long term. He also revealed his reasons for the stance for each of the tokens. He noted that the Apecoin token is a good prospect for placing a long trade as the ecosystem is preparing to introduce a new APE staking feature. \u201cYou can probably long until staking starts and then you can just short it,\u201d he added. For SUSHI, he pointed out that the token has been making nice moves lately despite the choppy trading conditions across the crypto market. Similarly, he maintains that LTC has been trading in pretty impressive regions. However, he conceded that the projection of tokens\u2019 potential to be profitable long trades is highly dependent on how Bitcoin (BTC) performs in the coming days. Reviewing BTC, he said that the benchmark crypto will likely regain ground early in December after its fast fall from around $21,000 in November when the FTX saga began. Meanwhile, he iterated that he does not expect BTC to springboard back to $20,000. \u201cBut maybe it goes like $18,000 or something like that. And then potentially new lows.

BTC has crossed the $17,000 mark for the first time in two weeks, currently trading at about $17,120, up 1.41 percent in the last 24 hours. The BTC recovery has also seen the total crypto market capitalization cross $900 billion again. Regardless, not all altcoins are yet to catch Bitcoin\u2019s bullish momentum. According to the latest price data, LTC, APE, and SUSHI are all trading in the red on the day. LTC is trading at around $77.26, down 1.20 percent in the last 24 hours. APE is trading at $3.97, down 2.39 percent, while SUSHI is trading at $1.39, down 0.51 percent in the last 24 hours.

    "description": "Kaunas, Lithuania, 1st December, 2022, ChainwireDappRadar, the global dapp store, said today in a report the blockchain gaming sector showed strong resilience throughout the month of November, despite negative pressure on the wider crypto industry that resulted from the collapse of the once-popular FTX cryptocurrency exchange. Blockchain games brought almost half of the blockchain activity DappRadar's latest Blockchain Games Report shows that blockchain gaming activity largely managed to brush off the events at FTX. The number of daily unique active wallets (UAW) averaged 800,875 in November, down slightly from just over 900,000 UAWs in the previous two months. All told, blockchain games accounted for a healthy 46% of all blockchain activity, ensuring it remains the biggest segment in the overall crypto space, ahead of decentralized finance. The most popular blockchain for gaming was, once again, Wax, which actually saw an increase in daily activity with an average of 344,284 daily UAWs in November, up more than 4% from October. BNB Chain was the second-most popular gaming protocol in October with an average of 171,269 dUAW but took a big hit in November and that number decreased by 35%. Taking BNB Chain\u2019s spot as the second-most popular gaming protocol in November was Hive, which also declined from the previous month by 8%, but maintained an average of 156,369 dUAW this month. \u00a0 There were a number of blockchains that suffered as a result of the fallout from the FTX collapse, though. In particular, gaming on the Solana blockchain - which was closely linked to FTX - appears to have taken a big hit.In November, it saw its gaming activity fall by a stunning 89.42% to just 2,326 daily UAWs, the lowest number it has registered thus far. Top-ranking games pick up speed while metaverses take a hit in sales Most of the games ranking in the top ten in terms of users put in a strong showing throughout the month. For instance, the Wax-based Alien Worlds managed to grow its user base by an impressive 25% to emerge as the most-played game of all, with 212,000 dUAWs. Splinterlands came in at number two with 169,000 dUAWs, up 5% from the previous month,\u00a0 November was a busy month for metaverse gamers too, with The Sandbox completing one of its most hyped events thus far, Alpha Season 3, with more than 353,000 unique users across 98 brand-generated experiences. While The Sandbox saw its NFT trading volume fall by around 33% last month to just over $1 million, it ended the month by announcing another big land sale. The upcoming sale promises to be a big event, with The Sandbox poised to auction off 1,967 LANDs, including 50 estates, 695 regular LANDs, 134 premium LANDs and 19 one-of-one LANDs. Both standard and premium LAND sales will be allocated via a blind ballot system. The sales actually kicked off on Nov. 24 and will continue until early in the New Year, so don't be surprised to see a significant uptick in The Sandbox's trading volume next month. Another popular metaverse, Decentraland, also witnessed a decline in November, with trading volume down 54% and sales down more than 23%. The decline in metaverse land sales is almost certainly a consequence of the goings on at FTX, which helped to accelerate a decline in land trading volume that began in July. It'll be interesting to see if the new LAND sale at The Sandbox can help to arrest the slide or not. Despite the decline in metaverse sales, the health of the blockchain gaming space looks positive overall, especially if the amount of cash being thrown at it from investors is anything to go by. The report notes that blockchain games and metaverse projects raised a combined $534 million in new funding throughout November. The highlight of the month was Web3 games publisher Fenix Games, which raised a hefty $150 million in the month to acquire, invest and distribute its portfolio of blockchain games. About DappRadar Founded in 2018, DappRadar is the The World's Dapp Store: a global decentralized applications (dapps) store, which makes it easy for its base of more than 1 million users per month to track, analyze, and discover dapp activity via its online platform.

    "content": ", the global dapp store, said today in a the blockchain gaming sector showed strong resilience throughout the month of November, despite negative pressure on the wider crypto industry that resulted from the collapse of the once-popular FTX cryptocurrency exchange. DappRadar's latest Blockchain Games Report shows that blockchain gaming activity largely managed to brush off the events at FTX. The number of daily unique active wallets (UAW) averaged 800,875 in November, down slightly from just over 900,000 UAWs in the previous two months. All told, blockchain games accounted for a healthy 46% of all blockchain activity, ensuring it remains the biggest segment in the overall crypto space, ahead of decentralized finance. The most popular blockchain for gaming was, once again, Wax, which actually saw an increase in daily activity with an average of 344,284 daily UAWs in November, up more than 4% from October. BNB Chain was the second-most popular gaming protocol in October with an average of 171,269 dUAW but took a big hit in November and that number decreased by 35%. Taking BNB Chain\u2019s spot as the second-most popular gaming protocol in November was Hive, which also declined from the previous month by 8%, but maintained an average of 156,369 dUAW this month. There were a number of blockchains that suffered as a result of the fallout from the FTX collapse, though. In particular, gaming on the Solana blockchain - which was closely linked to FTX - appears to have taken a big hit.In November, it saw its gaming activity fall by a stunning 89.42% to just 2,326 daily UAWs, the lowest number it has registered thus far. Most of the games ranking in the top ten in terms of users put in a strong showing throughout the month. For instance, the Wax-based Alien Worlds managed to grow its user base by an impressive 25% to emerge as the most-played game of all, with 212,000 dUAWs. Splinterlands came in at number two with 169,000 dUAWs, up 5% from the previous month, November was a busy month for metaverse gamers too, with The Sandbox completing one of its most hyped events thus far, Alpha Season 3, with more than 353,000 unique users across 98 brand-generated experiences. While The Sandbox saw its NFT trading volume fall by around 33% last month to just over $1 million, it ended the month by announcing another big land sale. The upcoming sale promises to be a big event, with The Sandbox poised to auction off 1,967 LANDs, including 50 estates, 695 regular LANDs, 134 premium LANDs and 19 one-of-one LANDs. Both standard and premium LAND sales will be allocated via a blind ballot system. The sales actually kicked off on Nov. 24 and will continue until early in the New Year, so don't be surprised to see a significant uptick in The Sandbox's trading volume next month. Another popular metaverse, Decentraland, also witnessed a decline in November, with trading volume down 54% and sales down more than 23%. The decline in metaverse land sales is almost certainly a consequence of the goings on at FTX, which helped to accelerate a decline in land trading volume that began in July. It'll be interesting to see if the new LAND sale at The Sandbox can help to arrest the slide or not. Despite the decline in metaverse sales, the health of the blockchain gaming space looks positive overall, especially if the amount of cash being thrown at it from investors is anything to go by. The report notes that blockchain games and metaverse projects raised a combined $534 million in new funding throughout November. The highlight of the month was Web3 games publisher Fenix Games, which raised a hefty $150 million in the month to acquire, invest and distribute its portfolio of blockchain games. Founded in 2018, is the The World's Dapp Store: a global decentralized applications (dapps) store, which makes it easy for its base of more than 1 million users per month to track, analyze, and discover dapp activity via its online platform. The platform currently hosts more than 12,000 dapps across 49 protocols and offers a plethora of consumer-friendly tools, including comprehensive NFT valuation, portfolio management, and daily industry-leading, actionable insight.

    "content": "Terra Luna Classic (LUNC) price has been sealed in a downward trend over the past few weeks amid a recoiling crypto market. Consequently, declined below the $0.00013 level during the second week of November. At its lowest point, LUNC dipped by almost 77% from its September high causing its market cap to plummet to around $970 million to position the token at #43 on CoinMarketCap\u2019s list of biggest cryptocurrencies. Terra\u2019s remnant, Terra Luna Classic, has become a famous crypto over the past few months despite the ecosystem\u2019s collapse in May. Notably, LUNC has done relatively better compared to the version supported by Do Kwon, Terra 2.0. Among the reasons behind Luna Classic\u2019s increasing popularity is the current burn rate where the tokens are placed in an inaccessible vault. Binance introduced a new 1.2% burn tax on LUNC tokens, pumping the price of Terra Luna Classic in September by 500%. More than 18.4 billion LUNC coins were burned in November alone, a significant increase from October\u2019s 18.3 billion and September\u2019s 4.2 billion burns. Another crucial catalyst for Terra Luna Classic is the increase in the number of addresses, rising to over 11,851 in November. This was higher compared to the 11,615 recorded in late October 2022. The upscale was significant given that the crypto market was in turmoil following the and its corporate sibling Alameda Research. In light of the recent FTX saga, the entire crypto market has suffered, leading to a plummeting LUNC price in the process. As shown on the daily chart (below), LUNC price has been on a downward trajectory recording lower lows and lower highs during mid-October and throughout November. The daily chart indicates a sizeable crash for LUNC price in November, before pulling back and forming a descending parallel pattern. In technical price analysis, this pattern is formed when an asset\u2019s price records a series of lower highs and lower lows over an extended period of time \u2013 usually more than two weeks. It is usually considered a significantly bearish technical formation over the longer term, showing that prices are in decline. LUNC price has dropped by almost 10% over the last 14 days, with all signs pointing to a continued downtrend despite the ongoing LUNC token burning. At the time of writing, LUNC is trading at $0.00016307 on , up by 0.4% over the last 24 hours but down by over 32% in the last 30 days. In the last 24 hours, LUNC has recorded trading volumes of over $66 million, which is lower compared to daily trades in the past month, such as November 17 when it recorded up to $159 million in intraday trading volume with signs of recovering from losses around FTX collapse. Terra Luna Classic price has moved below the 100-day and 50-day moving averages (MA), while the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator is moving below the neutral line, an indication that the the market still favours the downside. From the chart, there has not been much volatility in the last month. The relative strength index (RSI) plunged from 56 at the beginning of November, to reach 36 on December 1, 2022. During the past seven days, RSI has moved around 30 at the closing, a clear indication that bears may are still stronger that the bulls If the bears increase their supply, the LUNC price could continue plunging to break the support at $0.00015, embraced by the middle boundary of the falling channel. A drop further could see Terra\u2019s utilityt token declined toward the $0.00013 level embraced by the lower boundary of the prevailing chart pattern. Such a move would lead to 20.49% losses. On the other hand, if the bulls manage to sustain the support at $0.00015, they may push the price past the resistance at $0.000176, where the upper boundary of the descending parallel channel. The next possible target for LUNC price would be $0.000215, a 31% move upward. The recent LUNC dip is expected, given that not much development is happening within the ecosystem. Earlier in the year, the LUNC community considered reducing the supply to manage the epic drop in price, but this has not worked, as the amount being taken out of supply is low. In addition, that LUNC price is still plunging suggesting that the entire crypto market continues to suffer the aftermath of the FTX collapse, and adding this to the prolonged bear market, conditions remain blurry for when the whole market will recover. If you are considering ways to diversify your portfolio amid the current uncertainty in the crypto market, you should probably take a look at projects that are still budding so that you understand their fundamentals before diving in. Dash 2 Trade and IMPT are offering some of the best presales of the year, and have massive potential to deliver notable gains for early investors. stands among the most promising cryptocurrency projects to invest in now.

The native coin of the Dash 2 Trade platform is the D2T token. Users can use the D2T token to subscribe and gain access to the metrics of the platform\u2019s dashboard. The token is currently in the presale stage three, where a single D2T token is going for 0.0513 USDT. It is making desirable steps so far as 87.64% have already been sold. If you are looking for a crypto that is currently trending, D2T is the right choice and an amazing opportunity for early investors.

    "content": "Enlarge / You'll never see me coming... reader comments 35 with 0 posters participating Share this story Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Reddit Industry watchers who pay attention to Steam's Top Sellers charts may have noticed a surprising entry climbing near the top in recent days: a cosmetic Call of Duty skin pack themed after the Los Angeles Thieves Call of Duty League (CDL) team. Those surprisingly strong sales probably have little to do with team fandom, though, and more to do with how the nearly all-black kit can make players harder to spot in Modern Warfare II or Warzone 2.0 matches. The LA Thieves pack, which went on sale earlier this week, is one of 12 different themed skin packs designed around the 12 teams in the competitive CDL. But while every other available CDL skin pack features bright colors and/or a striped shoulder harness for easy visibility, the LA Thieves' offering is almost completely black, save for a small red \"LA\" logo on the chest, left arm, and back. Players have quickly noticed how this outfit could make them harder to see in the darker parts of some Call of Duty maps. \"Make sure you guys head to the store and pick up the only skin that gives you a competitive advantage,\" Thieves player Sam Larew cheekily tweeted on Tuesday. Wednesday morning, fan site CharlieIntel noticed the pack was the 11th bestselling item on all of Steam , as measured by total revenue. As of this writing, the $10 DLC still sits at the 18th position on Steam's US revenue charts , well ahead of popular games like Marvel Snap and Final Fantasy XIV . Enlarge / One of these things is not like the others... The next highest-selling CDL skin, the OpTic Texas pack , currently sits at 125th on an expanded list of Steam top sellers , suggesting it's not just demand for generic CDL skins driving those LA Thieves sales. \"I can assure you these Team Packs aren't usually very popular,\" says one writer at esports site EarlyGame . \"But the LA Thieves' kit is almost completely black, and it's becoming popular for all the wrong reasons... This is going to end well...\" Advertisement History repeating? Further Reading How \u201ccosmetic\u201d DLC became \u201cpay to win\u201d camouflage in some online shooters This isn't the first time the Call of Duty community has dealt with \"purely cosmetic\" DLC that provided players with a potential competitive advantage. In early 2021, Warzone players far and wide complained about the nearly all-black \"Roze\" skin , which was dominating tournaments and which at least one popular streamer said was \"ruining\" the game . After promising a fix in April, developer Raven Software finally made the Roze skin a bit brighter in a June 2021 game update. The skin had its brightness increased again, this time by 70 percent, in a May 2022 update that CharlieIntel said was \"meant to ensure that her outfit remains perfectly visible during intense gunfights.\" After just a few days of availability, the LA Thieves skin is already drawing plenty of Roze comparisons and complaints of \"Roze 2.0\" . One popular streamer even complained on Twitter that the new skin is \"somehow darker than Roze was in [ Warzone ].\" The LA Thieves \"knew what they were doing with this one,\" they added in a follow-up tweet . The LA Thieves CDL home variant for Modern Warfare 2 and Warzone 2 is SOMEHOW darker than Roze was in WZ1. pic.twitter.com/eruDswNZoK \u2014 ModernWarzone 2.0 (@ModernWarzone) November 29, 2022 Some players suggested that the improved lighting and lighter-colored desert maps in Warzone 2.0 mean an all-black skin will offer less of an advantage this time around. But that's far from a universal sentiment. \"The game is fast paced, anything that doesn't move is very difficult to identify as a threat except if it's very obvious,\" as one Redditor pointed out . \"If you're not wearing bright colors, it works.\" As eventually happened with Roze, Raven Software and Activision could once again nerf this new all-black skin to lessen its perceived visibility advantage in the game. But it seems unlikely that any such change will lead to refunds for all those players who are currently making the skin a surprise bestseller. As always, may the buyer beware.",

His comments suggest that Ethereum (ETH) could be a security. The CEO of Microstrategy, Michael Saylor, denoted this in a tweet citing Benham\u2019s remarks during an invitation-only crypto event at Princeton University. Saylor, an ardent Bitcoin maximalist, shared that the CFTC chair has now walked back on remarks he made in October when he suggested that Ether may also be a commodity. Today at Princeton, CFTC Chair Rostin Behnam said that the only cryptocurrency that should be viewed as a commodity is #Bitcoin , walking back from previous remarks made in October when he suggested Ether may also be a commodity. https://t.co/o5NrejDVaU \u2014 Michael Saylor\u26a1\ufe0f (@saylor) December 1, 2022 While speaking at the symposium hosted by Rutgers Law, Wall Street Blockchain Alliance, and Lowenstein Sandler in Manhattan at the time, Benham had stated that contrary to what its sister regulator\u2014the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)\u2014maintains, Ether is a commodity and should be regulated by his commission. Benham\u2019s latest stance on Ether possibly being a security would imply that the ETH market would be completely under the purview of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Meanwhile, during the Princeton presentation, Benham also asserted that the crypto market needs regulations now more than ever.

Benham defended the CFTC\u2019s actions towards the crypto market saying that the asset class is \u201cunlike any commodity we have dealt with.\u201d He added that the CFTC with its limited resources does not have the luxury of waiting for lawmakers and policymakers to provide clarity before acting. Meanwhile, he also rebuffed criticisms that the CFTC has faced for its connection with former FTX CEO , Sam Bankman-Fried, who allegedly donated thousands of dollars to the regulator. CFTC fighting for more crypto oversight powers The event is not the first time that Benham has called on law/policymakers to speed up regulatory clarity for digital assets. The CFTC chair has been calling for Congress to give the regular more oversight powers over certain cryptocurrencies, as well as increase the commission\u2019s budget to help it carry out its duties in the crypto market. Its push, which has received backing even from the SEC chair Gensler who recently stated that the CFTC should have oversight of stablecoins, has seen several bills introduced in Congress aimed at broadening the CFTC\u2019s jurisdiction. Back in September, a bill introduced by the leaders of the Senate Agriculture Committee, Chairwoman Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) and senior Republican, John Boozman (R-Ark.) took a procedural step towards being passed into law as Stacey Plaskett, a House of Representatives lawmaker, introduced a bill supporting the effort per coverage from Bloomberg.

    "content": "Photo by Markus Gilliar - GES Sportfoto/Getty Images The two stars faced each other at the World Cup Robert Lewandowski tried to shake Lionel Messi\u2019s hand, but the Argentine was not interested during his team\u2019s 2-0 victory over Poland at the FIFA World Cup. However, the two spoke after the match and seemed to be in good spirits. They embraced and shook hands on the pitch before going to their respective locker rooms. Messi himself was coy about what they spoke about. \u201cI was taught that everything that happens inside the pitch stays inside the pitch, and everything that happens in the locker room stays inside the locker room. I will not reveal anything about that interaction,\u201d Messi said. \"Me ense\u00f1aron que todo lo que pasa adentro de la cancha queda adentro de la cancha y todo lo que pasa en un vestuario queda adentro del vestuario. De m\u00ed no va a salir algo de la intimidad\". Messi, sobre su charla con Lewandowski. pic.twitter.com/sPUJpkqdKK\u2014 VarskySports (@VarskySports) November 30, 2022 Former Argentina and FC Barcelona striker Sergio Ag\u00fcero was also asked about the interaction. He is known as one of Messi\u2019s closest friends from their time together in the national team. Was there any conflict between the Polish star and the Argentine #10? \u201cNo, let\u2019s see. Sincerely, I\u2019ve not spoken to Messi about it. But in this match, Lewandowski fouled him. We all saw it. Lewy tried to shake his hand. But Messi was focused on the match,\u201d Ag\u00fcero replied. Is there something with Messi and Lewandowski?Kun Ag\u00fcero: No, let's see. Sincerely, I've not spoken to Messi about it. But in this match, Lewandowski fouled him. We all saw it. Lewy tried to shake his hand. But Messi was focused on the match.\u2014 Luis Mazariegos (@luism8989) December 1, 2022 A conflict between Lewandowski and Messi has been the subject of rumor for a while, although it\u2019s partially based on media outlets misinterpreting the Polish striker\u2019s statements.",

    "content": "The world\u2019s largest meme coin gets a boost from Twitter hype. XRP among coins delisted by Coinbase. FTM rallies on finances. Dogecoin was higher by almost 30% this week on increasing speculation that the meme coin could be used for Twitter payments. The cryptocurrency addition was mentioned during previously-leaked talks between new owner Elon Musk and its previous owners, but the platform recently paused work on a wallet. However, traders are still speculating that DOGE could be used at a later date. In a Sunday , Musk took to Twitter to share slides from an internal presentation. Named Unpacking \"Twitter 2.0,\" the billionaire shared some potential new changes. These included encrypted DMs and long-form tweets. The presentation also included a blank area for discussing payments, which led some to speculate that crypto will be back on the table soon. One drawback for Dogecoin could be its use of the Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus. The Tesla owner previously reversed a decision to accept Bitcoin as a payment option for the carmaker\u2019s vehicles over its energy usage. But Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin said in February this year that he would work with Dogecoin Foundation to help them follow Ethereum to the cleaner Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus. The price of DOGE was trading at the $0.1000 level on Thursday after the recent rally. Coinbase, the largest U.S.-based crypto exchange said this week that it would delist XRP, Bitcoin Cash, and Ethereum Classic from its crypto wallet. The exchange that the cryptocurrencies would no longer be supported on Coinbase Wallet from January \u201cdue to low usage,\u201d but users will be able to withdraw any unsupported assets with the wallet recovery phrase. XRP is still locked up in the long-running court battle with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The regulator claims that the coin should be classed as a security and accused its founders of profiting from an unregistered securities sale. On Wednesday, the SEC and defendants have been asked to file summary judgment reply briefs. The public can access redacted versions of these on December 5. The reply briefs are significant as Ripple could use the filing to push the SEC into a settlement. It means that we are likely to see the case drag into January at the earliest. The Ripple defense centers on statements from a previous director of the SEC. William Hinman said that Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) are not securities due to their decentralized nature. The SEC has tried to shield itself from those comments but they are likely to remain important to the final outcome. An SEC win has always been a headwind for the crypto industry which would then be faced to accept securities laws. The negative sentiment did not hurt XRP too badly, with the coin rising to $0.40 before finding resistance. Bitcoin was a meager 3.35% higher over the last seven days after the coin failed to find support. BTC was trading at $17,000 and was dragged lower by stocks and other assets after a hawkish speech from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. In a to the Brookings Institute, Powell said: \u201cWe think that slowing down at this point is a good way to balance the risks,\u201d Powell said. \u201cThe time for moderating the pace of rate increases may come as soon as the December meeting,\u201d set for Dec. 13-14. Although markets were boosted by prospects for a slower pace of interest rate hikes, he later added: For the medium term, investors will still look to higher-yielding assets and crypto will remain subdued. Fantom was the best-performing project with a 40% gain this week. The coin rebounded recently after distancing itself from the problems at FTX. Reports said that the Fantom Foundation generates consistent profits and has 30 years of income before it needs to sell any FTM tokens. The rally gained steam after Fantom Foundation\u2019s founder, Andre Cronje, the firm\u2019s financial records on November 28, revealing that it had $340 million worth of digital assets and had been earning over $10 million annually. \u201cMajor expenses include $3,000,000+ in listing fees for exchanges, $500,000+ \u2018sponsorship fees\u2019 for \u2018influencers\u2019. We decided to never pay for exchange listings or influencers again. Fantom becomes incredibly frugal. Complete marketing freeze. Hiring only essential staff.\u201d The FTM token was trading at $0.260 after the recent rally and is ranked number 59 in the list of coins by market cap.",

That day, Assassin's Creed Valhalla players will be able to purchase a character pack based on the shooter, which will include swords, armor sets, a mount skin, and a scout skin. Meanwhile, Destiny 2 players will be able to get a ship, Sparrow, Ghost, finisher cosmetics, and three armor ornament sets based on the Ubisoft game. Destiny 2 will also offer a weapons pack with \"four unique spins\" on the game's subclasses. Images of some of these new skins and designs can be found in the Tweet embedded below. The worlds of Assassin's creed and Destiny are about to collide.Assassin's Creed Valhalla and Destiny 2 Crossover Cosmetics: available December 6.#AssassinsCreed #LeapIntoTheLight-- Assassin's Creed (@assassinscreed) December 1, 2022 All in all, this seems like a strange concept for a crossover, but it will add some really unique designs to both Destiny 2 and Assassin's Creed Valhalla! Naturally, fans of both franchises have strong opinions about these designs. Generally, it seems that Destiny 2 fans are digging the Assassin's Creed Valhalla crossover, as the designs still feel true to Bungie's game. However, a lot of Assassin's Creed fans seem to think that the Destiny-inspired skins don't feel authentic to the Ubisoft series. At the end of the day, it's important to remember that this is just extra content, and players can decide for themselves whether any of it is worth purchasing! Crossover content isn't meant to be taken as part of any kind of official canon, and it can be easily ignored by those that choose to do so. Crossovers like this are becoming increasingly common in the video game industry, and sometimes the results don't gel perfectly! Destiny 2 and Assassin's Creed Valhalla are both available on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. Readers can check out all of our previous coverage for Destiny 2 right here and Assassin's Creed Valhalla right here. {replyCount}commentsAre you looking forward to this crossover content?

Co-stars on the series include Sam Richardson, Cecily Strong, Vanessa Bayer, Tim Heidecker, Steven Yeun, Paul Walter-Hauser and Bob Odenkirk. The first two seasons have become cult classics among fans, spawning original characterss including Bart Harley Jarvis, Karl Havoc, Car Focus Group Guy, Chunky, and the \"We're all trying to find the guy who did this\" Hot Dog Guy. The series was renewed for a third season earlier this year.\"Zach [Kanin] and I just found ourselves writing a lot of scenes like that, where the person is refusing to admit they've done something wrong, or lying, and will do anything to cover that up,\" Robinson previously told GQ. \"So it became the theme of the whole show because we kept gravitating towards writing those scenes.\"Will Detroiters come back?Another show involving Robinson, Kanin, and Richardson that has a special place in fans' hearts is Detroiters, \"A hundred percent, we'd want to go back,\" Richardson shared with ComicBook.com. \"I love Detroiters so much, and there was so much more that we want to do with it. So we've gotten ... I think it got clipped off the tree before it was fully, fully bare. I love and I am very proud of those first two seasons, but I'm also curious to what we would have done had we done more, and we still want to do more.\"\"We text each other, the creators, me, Tim, Joe [Kelly], and Zach [Kanin], we text each other plot points, pitches still,\" Richardson continued. \"Even if it's just for us to laugh about, we'll like text out ... [I don't want to] give those away, because who knows if we do come back, I don't want to burn a hilarious thing. We'll send it back and then we'll just start to stockpile and it kind of just snowballs and we come up with these episodes.

    "content": "The new Willow series debuted its first two episodes yesterday, and they feature the return of the 1988's film's Warwick Davis (Willow) and Joanne Whalley (Sorsha). In the original film, Willow teams up with some unlikely new friends in order to protect Elora Danan, a baby who was prophesied to bring down the evil Queen Bavmorda and become the empress of Tir Asleen, Galladoorn, Nockmaar, and Cashmere. The new series takes place many years later, and it's revealed in the beginning of the first episode that Elora had been hidden away for her own protection, and doesn't even know her own identity. However, her true self is revealed at the end of the first episode when she comes face to face with her old protector, Willow. Warning: Spoilers Ahead! Elora is first introduced as Dove (Ellie Bamber) who works in the kitchens at the Tir Asleen castle. She falls in love with Airk (Dempsey Byrk), the son of Sorsha and Madmartigen (Val Kilmer, who does not appear in the new show). When Airk is kidnapped, Dove secretly follows the team assembled to find him, which includes Airk's sister, Kit (Ruby Cruz). Upon meeting Willow at the end of the episode, the Nelwyn sorcerer uncovers the birthmark on her arm, proving her identity. In the second episode, Willow attempts to teach Elora magic, but the young apprentice seems hopeless. However, the very end of the episode teases her magical promise, which will have any Willow film fan excited about the character's future. Is Madmartigen Part of the Willow Series?While Val Kilmer was unable to return to play Madmartigen, Bryk and Cruz both capture the star's essence while playing his twin children. Recently, the duo had a chat with ComicBook.com's Chris Killian, and he asked if there was anything from Kilmer's performance in the original film that they tried to \"latch on to\" in order to \"make it feel more believable\" that they were the children of Madmartigan.\"Yeah, absolutely,\" Bryk replied. \"Definitely,\" Cruz agreed. \"Yeah, I think having access to that character was so helpful because we could sort of envision or imagine, we didn't have to imagine who he was, but then we could imagine how he was as a parent, which was really fun ... What we would admire, what we would reject, and I mean... I don't know how much we can spoil.\" Cruz then whispered something to Bryk and he replied, \"Yeah, I think that's probably fine.\" Cruz continued, \"Yeah, and sort of the absence of him was really interesting and sort of allowing our characters to - I actually don't want to spoil.\" Bryk added, \"It's also, you see their energy and that's your parent, so you kind of subconsciously let it filter in. I think the most conscious way ... I know for me personally, there were certain action moves or sword moves that were almost exact parallels. Little easter eggs that I'm curious to see if people will pick up on.\"{replyCount}commentsThe first two episodes of Willow are now streaming on Disney+.",

    "content": "It would appear God of War exists within the Marvel Cinematic Universe now. God of War is one of the biggest gaming franchises out there and is largely a result of the 2018 soft-reboot. Although it certainly had its time to shine on PS2 and PS3, many grew out of it as the franchise reflected a much more angsty and slightly immature side of the industry. They're fun games and still have a lot of value, but as time went on, the standards changed and more was demanded from games. The 2018 entry was a massive shake-up as it focused more on giving depth to Kratos and questioning is past behavior, offering a more mature take on the beloved franchise. The latest entry, God of War Ragnarok, is PlayStation's fastest selling first-party game of all-time which speaks volumes about its reach.It also seems that God of War has gained so much notoriety that it gained some recognition in the MCU. In the Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special that was recently released on Disney+, the franchise was name dropped. After Drax and Mantis land on Earth, they go to the Hollywood Walk of Fame and see a bunch of people dressed up as the Avengers, celebrities, and characters from other franchises. A family runs up to take a picture with Drax and Mantis, thinking they're also cosplayers, and a woman says \"I got a picture with the God of War!\" God of War reference in The Guardian's of the Galaxy Holiday Special from GodofWar Of course, they don't specifically name Kratos, but Drax does have the very general design of the character given he's bald, muscular, shirtless, and covered in scars and marks. It's also worth noting that Drax actor Dave Bautista has expressed interest in playing Kratos in Amazon's live-action adaptation of God of War. It's unclear if this will come to fruition, but Bautista has also been campaigning to star in Netflix's live action adaptation of Gears of War, an Xbox shooter franchise.What do you think of God of War being namedropped in the MCU?

    "content": "A new update about the Metal Gear Solid franchise is bad news for the long-running but increasingly dormant Konami IP. The update comes from the creator of the series, Hideo Kojima. As you may know, Kojima parted ways with Konami in 2015 after 29 years with the company. During this time he most notably created Metal Gear Solid. And if you're familiar with the split, you'll know it was a messy end to the relationship. Despite this, there have been rumors here and there claiming the pair have mended the relationship. On the back of this claim, the rumors vary, but there's no need to worry about the splintering claims because the foundation of the rumors isn't true. Speaking on his Brain Structure podcast, Kojima noted he's heard the requests of fans to return to work on Metal Gear Solid and other franchises he worked on when he was at Konami. That said, it's not happening. This is what Kojima specifically had to say about these requests: \"I take this as a positive thing, but also, as adults, everyone should know that this isn't going to happen.\" Of course, in the past Kojima said Metal Gear Solid V was going to be the last Metal Gear Solid game, and then once he left Konami, the nail only got hit deeper into the coffin. Yet, there's been rumors to the contrary but now we know there's nothing to these rumors. Konami could continue the series in the future, but it won't be with Kojima, and if Kojima isn't involved, it's not really Metal Gear Solid, is it?Obviously, things can always change, but it's hard to see Kojima changing his mind at this point. If he was going to work on Metal Gear Solid again, he probably would have by now. He's been clear he wants to work on new things, including movies. To go back to the Konami franchise would conflict with everything he's been saying lately, but if you were holding onto a glimmer of hope, it sounds like it's time to finally let it go.{replyCount}commentsH/T.

    "content": "Turn up the Awesome Mix: it's time to face the music in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3. Set to the tune of Spacehog's \"In the Meantime,\" the first trailer for the third and final installment of James Gunn's cosmic trilogy was released Thursday during Brazil's Comic Con Experience in S?o Paulo. Along with the return of the 2014 alternate timeline version of Gamora (Zoe Saldana) -- not seen since 2019's Avengers: Endgame -- the footage showed New Men creator the High Evolutionary (Chukwudi Iwuji) and the all-gold cosmic crusader Adam Warlock (Will Poulter). It also featured an Easter egg callback to 2014's original Guardians of the Galaxy. The trailer starts with a stylized version of the Marvel Studios logo as it transforms into Peter Quill's (Chris Pratt) tape deck. The logo resembles the red-and-white-striped sticker label of Awesome Mix Vol. 1 and Awesome Mix Vol. 2, the cassette mix tapes gifted to Peter by his late mother, Meredith Quill (Laura Haddock).After classic tracks like Redbone's \"Come and Get Your Love\" on Vol. 1 and Fleetwood Mac's \"The Chain\" on Vol. 2, the Vol. 3 soundtrack will look a little different: at the end of Vol. 2, Peter inherited a Zune MP3 player with 300 songs, one last gift from adoptive father Yondu (Michael Rooker). Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 Soundtrack In 2020, Gunn shared \"Meredith Quill's Complete Awesome Mix,\" a curated Spotify \"master list of Meredith Quill's favorite songs\" that Gunn considered for the Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 1 and 2 soundtracks. \"I'm not promising I won't use these in future films, but I feel we could all deal with a little joy during our time in quarantine,\" Gunn wrote of the 64-song playlist, which includes tracks like \"You Make Me Feel Like Dancing\" by Leo Sayer, \"She's Gone\" by Hall & Oates, and \"Renegade\" by Styx. So far, Vol. 3 tracks include a remixed version of the 1996 song \"In the Meantime\" by Spacehog and the 2002 song \"Do You Realize??\" by The Flaming Lips. The latter featured in the San Diego Comic-Con trailer that was made exclusively for the convention crowd. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 Cast and Synopsis In Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3, our beloved band of misfits are looking a bit different these days. Still reeling from the loss of Gamora, Peter Quill must rally his team around him to defend the universe and protect one of their own. A mission that, if not completed successfully, could quite possibly lead to the end of the Guardians as we know them.James Gunn writes and directs Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3, which stars Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista, Karen Gillan, Pom Klementieff, featuring Vin Diesel as Groot, Bradley Cooper as Rocket, Sean Gunn, Chukwudi Iwuji, Will Poulter and Maria Bakalova. Kevin Feige is the producer and Louis D'Esposito, Victoria Alonso, Nikolas Korda, Simon Hatt, and Sara Smith serve as executive producers.{replyCount}commentsMarvel Studios' Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 opens only in theaters on May 5th, 2023.",

    "content": "Many people are willing to work harder to steal money than they would ever have to work to earn it. Moreover, the penalties for being caught stealing money far outweigh the potential benefits of getting away with it. And yet, scammers continue to scam wherever they see an opening. Debt relief, populated as it is with people anxiously seeking solutions to debt problems, is often seen as fertile ground for these bad actors. With that in mind, here\u2019s some advice for avoiding debt relief scams. When it Sounds Too Good to Be True \u201cWe guarantee we can help you pay off all of your debts for pennies on the dollar!\u201c That\u2019s a tough idea to resist when your ends are so far apart they aren\u2019t even speaking the same language. You\u2019ll need to muster up the wherewithal to resist that siren song though, lest you get taken for a very expensive ride. Legitimate debt relief companies are prohibited by law from guaranteeing they can get you a debt settlement deal with your creditors. Further, debt settlement only works on specific types of unsecured debt. Child support, alimony, car loans, home loans and federal student debt are immune to debt settlement. What\u2019s more, some creditors will refuse to accept debt settlement agreements altogether, so there\u2019s no way anyone can guarantee your eligible debts can be settled\u2014let alone the ineligible ones. \u201cWe\u2019ll Go To Work As Soon as You Pay the Settlement Fee\u201d The law also prohibits debt settlement companies from charging you upfront settlement fees. They can only request payment for services rendered after the services have been rendered. In other words, they have to negotiate an agreement with one of your creditors, get your approval of that agreement, then disburse whatever that agreement requires\u2014 before they can invoice you for that work. Yes, debt relief companies are allowed to impose a small signup fee and minimal monthly service charges. However, these typically only run in the neighborhood of $9.95. Meanwhile, settlement fees typically run between 15% and 25% of the amount of debt settled on your behalf. Anyone asking for that money up front is operating in violation of the law. \u201cYou Can Stop Communicating With Your Creditors Now\u201d Scammers advise marks to stop talking to creditors\u2014they\u2019ll take over from there on out. The problem with that is you\u2019ll never know if they even got in touch with your creditors. You\u2019re happily sending the scammers money to \u201csettle your debts, \u201c while your creditors have no idea you\u2019ve \u201cenrolled\u201d in a debt relief program. By the time you figure out what\u2019s going on, you could be many, many thousands of dollars deeper in debt, and the nefarious individuals have taken your money and disappeared. \u201cDon\u2019t Worry About the Details, We\u2019ll Take Care of Everything\u201d Ahhhhhhh, but the devil \u2014 as the old saying goes \u2014 is in the details. Scammers gloss over them because many aspects of the debt relief process can be off-putting at first glance. For example: \u2022 The forgiven amount of your debt might be subject to taxation by the IRS. \u2022 The debt relief process will have a negative impact on your credit score. \u2022 The process can take anywhere from two to five years to complete, depending upon the amount of debt you have, how many debts you have and with what entities those debts reside. \u2022 There are no guarantees the process will work, because settlement agreements are predicated upon getting buy-in from creditors. Any company rushing you to sign up before demonstrating crystalline transparency about those details should be avoided. In fact, that information should be conveyed before they look over your finances to see if you\u2019re even a viable candidate. The people with whom you\u2019ve been speaking did look over your finances before asking you to sign up\u2014right? That\u2019s one of the hallmarks of the validity of Freedom Debt Relief and other legitimate operators in this space. Scammers don\u2019t bother with that step, nor do they discuss credit card payment strategies with you firstbecause they have no intention of doing anything about your debt. The Bottom Line This brings us back to our first point of advice for avoiding debt relief scams. If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. It is impossible to overstress the importance of conducting due diligence on any debt relief firm with which you\u2019re considering contracting. Run their name past the Better Business Bureau. Check them out with the Office of the Attorney General in your state. Look to see if the American Fair Credit Council accredits them. The money you save will most assuredly be your own.",

    "description": "Amid rising hate crime, America still can\u2019t decide how bigotry and health fit together, and the debate has major legal implications",
    "content": "Everyone knows that Law & Order plotlines are often, as they say, ripped from the headlines. But Dr. Alvin Poussaint, 88, knows this on another level: An emeritus professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, he has had the unusual experience of seeing his ideas incorporated into a season 12 episode of the long-running show. In it, a white working stiff murders a Black CEO in a dispute over a New York City taxicab. When the trial begins, a respected Black psychiatrist takes the stand to present his idea that the defendant suffers from \u201cextreme racism,\u201d a mental illness. His lawyers argue that extreme racism has such a complete hold on the defendant that it mitigates their client\u2019s legal responsibility for the murder. In the final moments, the audience is encouraged to feel that it\u2019s a victory for justice, for law and order, when the jury rejects the psychiatrist\u2019s ideas, Poussaint tells me with a tinge of disdain. [time-brightcove not-tgx=\u201dtrue\u201d] In the real world, Poussaint was that psychiatrist. Sort of. While he never brought his ideas to the witness stand inside the New York City courthouse behind those massive stone steps that Law & Order made famous, in 1999 he shared his theories on the link between mental health and extreme forms of bigotry on the op-ed pages of the New York Times. In doing so, he helped set off a debate that ended with the American psychiatric establishment publicly rejecting the concept\u2014partly on the grounds that so many people are racists. But even now, after nearly a decade during which the number of hate crimes has steadily increased, the question of the relationship between bigotry and mental illness has never fully been resolved. In fact, recent high-profile incidents have made public perception of that dynamic perhaps as muddled as ever. The issue comes up in relation to everything from major mass shootings to pop-culture discourse. The racist attack at a Buffalo, N.Y., supermarket, for which the gunman pleaded guilty this week to state murder and domestic terrorism charges, prompted calls for the country to \u201cget serious about mental health\u201d as well as pleas not to talk about the shooting as a matter of psychiatric illness rather than a racist hate crime. Read more: Anti-Black Violence Has Long Been the Most Common American Hate Crime\u2014And We Still Don\u2019t Know the Full Extent It\u2019s hard to distinguish what psychiatric experts have decided not to define, to separate what Poussaint calls \u201ceveryday racism\u201d\u2014covering the span from systemic discrimination to microaggressions\u2014from the extreme version, which he and others have described as the point at which bigotry so deeply shapes behavior that a person struggles to function and sometimes becomes dangerous. But the question is more than just a thought experiment. If extreme racism were to become accepted as a mental illness per se, more suspects in hate-crime cases could potentially have recourse to mount \u201cinsanity\u201d defenses in court. And given all the mass shootings and disturbing public events in which extreme racism appears to have played some part since Poussaint first described his ideas, it\u2019s also hard not to wonder. Might developing a research-backed extreme-racism diagnosis\u2014and sound treatments\u2014have saved lives? Joshua Bessex\u2014APA memorial outside the Tops Friendly Market after a mass shooting in Buffalo, N.Y., is seen July 14, 2022. Though the FBI typically releases data each fall detailing the prior year\u2019s hate-crimes statistics, the agency has not yet done so in 2022. But social conditions are rife, experts say, for the increase to continue. (In 2020, the most recent year for which FBI data is available, the agency reported 8,263 incidents\u2014an increase of nearly a thousand over the prior year, despite 452 fewer agencies reporting\u2014and most experts believe the real number is higher.) Police have noted that 47 out of 100 people arrested for hate crimes in New York City in early 2022 \u201chave prior documentation of an [emotionally disturbed person] incident.\u201d So the stakes are high for the nation\u2019s courtrooms to respond to the trauma unleashed by that dynamic\u2014and for Americans to decide what constitutes a just outcome. \u201cIt\u2019s complicated,\u201d says Sander Gilman, a historian at Emory University who researches the relationship between health, science, law, and society, and who has long taught a course on extremism. \u201cBut I\u2019m going to start with two things that I call Gilman\u2019s Law: not all racists are crazy, but crazy people can be racists.\u201d Thanks in part to the influence of pop culture\u2014not least those TV police procedurals\u2014many assume that insanity pleas are common. In reality, mental-health defenses are rare, and even more rarely lead to reduced punishment. Mounting that kind of defense requires time and significant resources to gather evidence and expert testimony, so in practice it is not an avenue available to all defendants. In England and the U.S., courts began to reliably consider the mental health of defendants only in the 19th century. The M\u2019Naghten rule, a standard for determining a defendant\u2019s sanity at the time of a crime, was established in 1840s England. It holds that only the sane can be held responsible for their actions. As a result, the question of mental fitness\u2014sufficient sanity to participate meaningfully in one\u2019s own defense\u2014is sometimes evaluated before a trial. (Whether the state has an obligation or right to treat such an illness in order for the person to then stand trial is, Gilman says, a question that goes back as far as the idea of such a defense.) Once a competency decision has been made, the accused who do go to trial have the right to a defense. In some cases, that may include an option for a jury to find the defendant not guilty by reason of mental disorder. In others, ideas about the mental health of the defendant may more informally shape what evidence is presented. But so-called \u201cmental disease or defect\u201d defenses are used in only about 1% of cases, says Michael Boucai, a professor at the State University of New York at Buffalo School of Law and an expert on mental health and other social issues in courtrooms. Those defenses are successful in even fewer cases; in fact, such a tactic often backfires or results in a defendant confined for a longer term inside a hospital than that person would have spent in prison, sometimes with no end date. And even rarer\u2014though not unheard of\u2014is an attempt to use racism or other bigotry as an indicator of mental-health challenges, he says. \u201cI think it would be extremely hard,\u201d says Boucai, \u201cI mean extremely hard, to succeed on the theory that extreme racism per se\u2014particularly subscription to a theory\u2014is a mental illness for the purpose of criminal responsibility. Just because you have a psychologist or psychiatrist saying this person is mentally ill does not mean the law has to [accept] that.\u201d (Nor does the defendant: Dylann Roof, the white man who shot and killed nine Black worshippers inside a Charleston, S.C., church in 2015\u2014whose legal team used words like \u201cdelusional,\u201d \u201cabnormal,\u201d and \u201csuicidal\u201d to describe their client\u2014rejected advice from his lawyers to attempt to avoid the death penalty by allowing them to argue that he was insane or suffering from a mental defect at the time of the shooting.) Stephen B. Morton\u2014APA crowd prays outside the Emanuel AME Church after a memorial service for the nine people killed in a racist attack at the church in Charleston, S.C., June 19, 2015. Some fear that raising mental-health issues in court runs the risk of bolstering inaccurate myths about the mentally ill. In reality, mentally ill people are disproportionately more likely to become the victims of crime, and most do nothing to victimize others. And, as has been observed after so many headlinemaking crimes, suspects from privileged groups are more likely to have their actions described as illness in need of treatment instead of criminal evil meriting punishment. Some experts fear that shifting the conversation to questions of mental health can also draw attention away from hateful ideas embraced by the person accused of the crime\u2014ideas that are today often shared by people, including public figures, whose mental health is not questioned. That\u2019s how important social problems that require the nation\u2019s attention are transformed into one individual\u2019s medical problems, says W. Carson Byrd, a sociologist at the University of Michigan. Column: We Need to Take Action to Address the Mental Health Crisis in This Pandemic That line of thinking is particularly problematic in a culture prone to dismiss the need for systemwide reforms to address inequality, Byrd says. It can foster an emphasis on quick fixes for the world\u2019s long-standing problems with bigotry. (In 2012, for example, a team of British researchers announced that an existing heart and blood-pressure drug appeared to reduce implicit bias after a study involving just 36 subjects.) \u201cWhite supremacy is a very normal part of society,\u201d says Byrd, who is also the faculty director of research initiatives at his university\u2019s National Center for Institutional Diversity. It is not a good or productive part of society, he points out, but a deeply entrenched one. \u201cOne of the detriments of trying to look at racism as a form of psychopathology or mental illness is that it makes that [illness] abhorrent, as if everything else is working in a certain [non-racist] way.\u201d Research has also long shown that bigotry is not an inborn human trait, but rather something learned from our environments, Byrd says. While racism can influence one\u2019s mental health, describing racism itself\u2014even \u201cextreme racism\u201d\u2014as a mental illness implies that bigotry exists beyond our individual and collective control. \u201cBy medicalizing [extreme racism], making it something curable, a mental-health disorder, it pulls away from having those broader conversations about how society is impacting people,\u201d he says. \u201cWe just try to figure out, \u2018How do we fix this one person?\u2019\u201d This problem, Boucai notes, can already be clearly seen in discussions about gun crime, and mass shootings in particular: \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to understand these crimes and the discourse of insanity provides one way to do it,\u201d says Boucai. \u201cBut I think we can see where that sort of language is irresponsible and potentially undermines a just result.\u201d In other words, if a mass shooter is simply insane, then wholesale gun-law reform can, to some, seem unnecessary, even unwise. When bigotry is involved, that supposed insanity might, some who oppose Poussaint\u2019s ideas believe, undermine systemwide efforts toward equity\u2014or at least toward greater safety for those most likely to be targeted. In 1999, when Poussaint wrote his op-ed advocating for increased research into possible psychiatric treatments for extreme racism, he was the author of acclaimed books about the effects of racism on Black mental health and a veteran of public controversy. Years earlier he\u2019d argued publicly that racial pride among Black Americans could be taken to an unhealthy extreme. By the 1990s, he may have been best known for his work with Bill Cosby, consulting on scripts for The Cosby Show in a massively popular effort to disrupt stereotypes. Poussaint first published his ideas about extreme racism weeks after a man named Buford O. Furrow Jr. shot and seriously injured four children and an adult inside a Jewish Community Center in Los Angeles, then shot and killed a nearby Asian-American postal worker. When captured and ultimately convicted, Furrow told investigators his actions had been motivated by hate. Reporters unearthed information indicating that Furrow had close relationships with known white nationalists, and also that he had been evaluated by Washington State\u2019s mental-health system only months before the attack. He\u2019d even told officials after a previous arrest for assault that he\u2019d \u201cfantasized,\u201d about mass murder. To Poussaint, this story signaled a growing threat posed by a failure to recognize that, while highlighting and combating systemic racism is important in preventing discrimination, so is identifying and helping individuals motivated by bigotry who might go so far as to injure or kill others. Read more: 11 People Were Killed in 48 Hours in Mass Shootings Across America. It\u2019s Likely to Get Worse The idea had been brewing for years. In 1993, a Jamaican immigrant named Colin Ferguson had shot and killed six people and injured 19 aboard a New York commuter train after years of personal struggles that he blamed on white and Asian people, whom he referred to as \u201cdevils.\u201d Ferguson had been pinned down by passengers on the train to stop the shooting but, while defending himself at trial, he argued that someone else committed the crime. (Ferguson\u2019s lawyers had planned to argue that he was insane at the time, suffering from something called \u201cBlack rage,\u201d another condition debated but not officially recognized by the American Psychiatric Association and that was the subject of a Law & Order episode.) After the train shootings, Poussaint\u2014a Haitian-American son of immigrants\u2014had noted Ferguson\u2019s trajectory: racist thinking, delusions that had come to dominate his life, then mass violence. This was a textbook case of extreme racism. Alan Raia\u2014Newsday RM/Getty ImagesTrain passengers are treated on the platform after Colin Ferguson opened fire on the train as it arrived at Garden City, N.Y., on December 7, 1993. \u201cExtreme racism crosses the line and is out of control,\u201d he explains. \u201cJust like somebody can have a little bit of anxiety, but if they have anxiety to the point that it is immobilizing, then it is a mental disorder.\u201d Mass shooters behind hate crimes are, as he sees it, in a similar state: \u201c[They] weren\u2019t functioning individuals. They were impaired by their mental pathology.\u201d When the third edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), the guide that mental-health professionals use to make their diagnoses, was published in 1980, clinicians like Poussaint considered racism\u2014not extreme racism, but what he calls everyday racism\u2014a potential symptom of several conditions, from paranoid personality disorder to generalized anxiety disorder. Racism alone is not sufficient to diagnose a patient with one of those conditions, but an extreme racist, Poussaint says, likely suffers from delusions. Such people live with multiple symptoms including paranoia; they are likely to project negative traits or outcomes onto entire groups and sustain those beliefs even in the face of strong countervailing evidence. Many embrace conspiracy theories. Some may grow violent. In fact, Poussaint argued in a 2002 Western Journal of Medicine article, the extreme racist often begins with \u201cverbal expression of antagonism, progresses to avoidance of members of disliked groups, then to active discrimination against them, to physical attack, and finally to extermination (lynchings, massacres, genocide). That fifth point on the scale, the acting out of extermination fantasies, is readily classifiable as delusional behavior.\u201d Poussaint was not the first person to raise the idea that extreme racism is itself a mental illness. But he was among those leading the call for the American Psychiatric Association, publishers of the DSM, to consider putting it in subsequent editions of the manual, which has a long history of evolving, often slowly, in response to research and norms. When his op-ed ran, it seemed to Poussaint, people pounced. Some of his fellow Black psychiatrists argued that such a diagnosis would unleash a wave of legal excuse-making, helping no one but the violent racists themselves. Poussaint counters that other health diagnoses have yet\u2014nearly 200 years after psychological concerns officially entered American courtrooms\u2014to produce rafts of acquittals. And some clinicians and researchers argued that there are other ways of attacking racism besides treating it as an illness\u2014educational programs, diversity initiatives, policy changes. That\u2019s a point Poussaint says he doesn\u2019t oppose, at least when it comes to everyday racism. Those steps can help racists who embrace repugnant ideas while remaining functional parts of society. But those aren\u2019t the people he\u2019s talking about. \u201cRacism negatively impacts public health,\u201d the American Psychiatric Association told TIME in a statement. \u201cThe American Psychiatric Association has been focusing on this in the DSM by identifying and addressing the impact of structural racism on the over- or underdiagnosis of mental disorders in certain ethno-racial groups. From time to time we have received proposals to create a diagnosis of extreme racism but they have not met the criteria identified for creating new disorders.\u201d To this day, Poussaint believes that extreme racism is very likely its own disorder in need of study, possible diagnostic criteria, and evidence-based treatment, he told me in September from his home in Massachusetts. But after retiring about 2\u00bd years ago at the age of 86, he says he\u2019s too far out of the professional mix to continue to push for an extreme racism diagnosis. I ask Poussaint what he thinks might have happened if extreme racism had become its own diagnosable condition listed in the DSM. Extreme racism might have been a topic on talk shows and a more frequent topic of news coverage, he says. With research and public information campaigns, the need for intervention could have been as clear as it is for heart attacks; the steps to do so as well-known as CPR. \u201cWe\u2019d get away from treating it as if [extreme racism] is normative,\u201d Poussaint says, \u201clike a cultural difference because America is a racist country. We have made it normative by not calling it what it is. Even people in general society, friends and relatives and even the afflicted individual, would recognize it as a disorder and say, \u2018I\u2019m not alright.\u2019 People who get swept up by anxiety and can\u2019t function, they don\u2019t think they are normal. They say, \u2018This is taking over my life. I need some help.\u2019 [A diagnosis] clues the family to say, \u2018This person is really troubled and we have to get them some help.\u2019\u201d \u2014with reporting by Solcyre Burga, Mariah Espada and Simmone Shah",

    "content": "Planetary scientists have greatly anticipated using the James Webb Space Telescope\u2019s infrared vision to study Saturn\u2019s enigmatic moon Titan and its atmosphere. The wait is finally over and the results are spectacular. Plus, JWST had a little help from one of its ground-based observatory friends in helping to decode some strange features in the new images. Turns out, JWST had just imaged a rare event on Titan: clouds. In these new images, the white areas near the top of Titan are clouds, likely made from methane. The clouds appear to have formed over Titan\u2019s northern region, known to have lakes made of liquid hydrocarbons. Images of Saturn\u2019s moon Titan, captured by the James Webb Space Telescope\u2019s NIRCam instrument Nov. 4, 2022. Left: Image using F212N, a 2.12-micron filter sensitive to Titan\u2019s lower atmosphere. The bright spots are prominent clouds in the northern hemisphere. Right: Color composite image using a combination of NIRCam filters: Blue=F140M (1.40 microns), Green=F150W (1.50 microns), Red=F200W (1.99 microns), Brightness=F210M (2.09 microns). Several prominent surface features are labeled: Kraken Mare is thought to be a methane sea; Belet is composed of dark-colored sand dunes; Adiri is a bright albedo feature. Image credit: NASA, ESA, CSA, A. Pagan (STScI). Science: Webb Titan GTO Team. Titan\u2019s nitrogen-rich atmosphere covers the moon like a shroud, as it is 50% denser than Earth\u2019s atmosphere and visible light cannot penetrate it. But astronomers have figured out ingenious ways to see through the atmosphere \u2013 using radar, infrared techniques, and other tricks (more on that later), enabling them to see details in Titan\u2019s atmosphere and amazingly, even down to surface to see features like dunes, as well as the hydrocarbon rivers and lakes. While astronomers have been able to detect clouds in Titan\u2019s atmosphere since 1995, according to planetary scientist Sarah H\u00f6rst, it\u2019s rare and Titan can go years and years without detectable clouds. For JWST to see them at its first go at Titan is remarkable \u2013 with maybe a little luck thrown in. JWST imaged Titan on November 4. A NASA blog post details how Sebastien Rodriguez from the Universite Paris Cit\u00e9 was the first to see the new images when the data arrived to Earth, and Rodriguez alerted the rest of the team in an email: \u201cWhat a wake-up this morning (Paris time)! Lots of alerts in my mailbox! I went directly to my computer and started at once to download the data. At first glance, it is simply extraordinary! I think we\u2019re seeing a cloud!\u201d JWST Solar System GTO Project Lead Heidi Hammel, from the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy (AURA), had a similar reaction: \u201cFantastic! Love seeing the cloud and the obvious albedo markings. So looking forward to the spectra! Congrats, all!!! Thank you!\u201d The team quickly called in colleagues at the Keck Telescope on Mauna Kea in Hawai\u2019i to perform follow-up observations. A series of Keck images taken about 30 and 54 hours after JWST\u2019s showed similar clouds \u2014 likely the same ones \u2014 but slightly displaced because of the moon\u2019s rotation relative to Earth. \u201cWe were concerned that the clouds would be gone when we looked at Titan one and two days later with Keck, but to our delight there were clouds at the same positions, looking like they might have changed in shape,\u201d said Imke de Pater, a UC Berkeley Professor of the Graduate School, in a press release. The astronomers cautioned, however, that since clouds are not long-lasting on Titan or Earth, so those seen on November 4 by JWST may not be the same as those seen on November 7 by Keck. Evolution of clouds on Titan over 30 hours between Nov. 4 and Nov. 6, as seen by near-infrared cameras on the James Webb Space Telescope (top) and Keck Telescope. Titan\u2019s trailing hemisphere seen here is rotating from left (dawn) to right (evening) as seen from Earth and the sun. Cloud A appears to be rotating into view, while Cloud B appears to be either dissipating, or moving behind Titan\u2019s limb. Clouds are not long-lasting on Titan or Earth, so those seen on Nov. 4 may not be the same as those seen on Nov. 6. (Image credit: NASA/STScI/Keck Observatory/Judy Schmidt) Titan is the only moon in the Solar System with a dense atmosphere and the only planetary body other than Earth that currently has surface features like rivers, lakes and seas. Unlike Earth, however, the liquid on Titan\u2019s surface is composed of hydrocarbons including methane and ethane, not water. The new and continued observations of Titan from JWST, combined with those from Earth-bound telescopes, will help astronomers understand the weather patterns on Titan. Additionally, the upcoming mission to this moon, scheduled for launch in 2027 called Dragonfly, will also provide more insights. Dragonfly has a multirotor lander and will assess the habitability of Titan\u2019s unique environment. For some additional info on how astronomers use every trick the book to see through Titan\u2019s thick atmosphere \u2014 and how clouds were first seen on that moon \u2014 the Planet Dr, Sarah H\u00f6rst has a great thread on Twitter explaining it all: Anyone want a quick Titan cloud thread?\u2014 Dr./Prof. Sarah H\u00f6rst (@PlanetDr) December 1, 2022 The science team that used JWST to study Titan are still working through their data, and so these observations are still a work in progress, and the team stressed their work has not yet been through the peer-review process.

    "content": "Enlarge / Nvidia's 12VHPWR power cable adapter, as shipped with an RTX 4080. (credit: Andrew Cunningham) Nvidia's new RTX 4090 and 4080 GPUs both use a new connector called 12VHPWR to deliver power as a way to satisfy ever-more power-hungry graphics cards without needing to set aside the physical space required for three or four 8-pin power connectors. But that power connector and its specifications weren't actually created by Nvidia alone\u2014to ensure interoperability, the spec was developed jointly by the PCI Express Special Interest Group (PCI-SIG), a body whose members include Nvidia, AMD, Intel, Arm, IBM, Qualcomm, and others. But the overheating and melting issues experienced by some RTX 4090 owners recently have apparently prompted the PCI-SIG to clarify exactly which parts of the spec it is and is not responsible for. In a statement reported by Tom's Hardware, the group sent its members a reminder that they, not the PCI-SIG, were responsible for safety testing products using connector specs like 12VHPWR. \"Members are reminded that PCI-SIG specifications provide necessary technical information for interoperability and do not attempt to address proper design, manufacturing methods, materials, safety testing, safety tolerances, or workmanship,\" the statement reads. \"When implementing a PCI-SIG specification, Members are responsible for the design, manufacturing, and testing, including safety testing, of their products.\"Read 3 remaining paragraphs | Comments",

    "content": "Following past months of drops, Ripple found support and recovered from the extended bearish circle as it continued to trade above the yearly low. The price crashed to this low during last month\u2019s crash but has significantly bounced back again. Amongst the top cryptocurrencies in the market, XRP technically appeared to have found a bottom at the $0.3 level, where the price broke out in the last bull run. Since the price left this crucial level in January 2021, XRP failed to revisit it until the market crashed in June. After the revisit, XRP continued to advance higher. Despite the November crash that took most top coins to their two-year low, it has held firm and continues to stay above the mentioned bottom price level. The recent recovery shows the bulls\u2019 commitment to the market. Looking at the weekly chart, we can see that XRP formed a perfect double-bottom pattern, which indicates a potential bull run. However, the buying volume is still low. There\u2019s a need for a weekly close above $0.55 to confirm a complete reversal. It traded between $0.32 and $0.41 for the past three weeks. Similarly, the price is trapped in a symmetrical triangle as it primes for a breakout. While a breakdown will send the price to the lower range, a breakup will set a more bullish tone in the market. Ripple Price Analysis (XRPUSDT): 4-Hour Chart Source: Tradingview On the 4-hour chart, Ripple looks bullish following the past two weeks\u2019 increase. If the price breaks the $0.4065 resistance level, we can expect buying towards the $0.44 level and potentially $0.489 in the coming days. Otherwise, a drop from the symmetry triangle could cause the price to fall again. Along the way down, the support to watch is $0.374 and $0.36 before rolling to the lower range of $0.32. The $0.3 and $0.28 levels are also areas to watch out for in case of more dip. Key Resistance Levels: $0.4065, $0.44, $0.487 Key Support Levels: $0.374, $0.36, $0.32 Spot Price: $0.395 Trend: Bullish Volatility: High Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

    "content": "Avalanche (AVAX) and Chainlink (LINK) are two of the cryptocurrency projects badly hit by the crypto world\u2019s instability. The duo have plummeted recently in line with the crypto world\u2019s current depreciation. On the contrary, Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) continues its imperviousness to the bear market as it rises 260% during presale. >>BUY ORBEON TOKENS HERE<< Avalanche (AVAX): Layer One Blockchain Token Loses Value Avalanche is a multifunctional layer-one blockchain platform for custom blockchain networks and decentralized applications. Created to rival Ethereum, Avalanche was created as a blockchain for deploying smart contracts. Despite the lofty aim, Avalanche has also been hit by the depreciation sweeping the cryptocurrency industry. Available information from CoinMarketCap indicates that the Avalanche token has lost a whopping 5.53% of its value within the past 24 hours at the time of writing. Its current price of a little over $12 per Avalanche (AVAX) coin is a far cry from the over $146 it was sold a year ago, indicating its gradual depreciation over the year. As such, many Avalanche investors are disappointed, and are aware that Avalanche has a significant way to go to recover this lost value. ChainLink Falls as the Crypto Market Loses Value Chainlink is \u201ca blockchain abstraction layer that enables universally connected smart contracts.\u201d Its primary purpose is to allow \u201cblockchains to securely interact with external data feeds, events, and payment methods.\u201d Chainlink\u2019s current price is $7, a 1.24% depreciation from its value 24 hours earlier. A peek into its price history shows that it gradually depreciated from a little under $53 a year ago to its current value. >>BUY ORBEON TOKENS HERE<< Orbeon Protocol Unabatedly Appreciates Amidst Global Crypto Dip While most tokens have failed to weather the storm of depreciation convincingly, Orbeon Protocol has once again proven why it\u2019s the most resilient project. For years, startups have been unable to raise capital quickly and efficiently, free of the regulatory red tape that slows fundraising through traditional routes. Meanwhile, everyday investors have been unable to access the venture capital market. This all changes with Orbeon Protocol. Through its NFT-as-Service (NFTsaS) feature, Orbeon protocol assists startups looking to raise capital by allowing them to mint reward and equity-backed NFTs as a form of fundraising. These can be issued to everyday investors, for purchase as low as $1. In this way, the startups can raise capital quicker and from a much wider source, while investors can access the venture capital market. The Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) presale has recently begun and industry experts are impressed by its performance so far. They have predicted that the project\u2019s native ORBN tokens, used for governance rights, staking bonuses and more, will surge by at least 6000% at the end of the presale.

    "content": "Keeping up with the ongoing projects and their respective token values can be a hassle for investors. Early investors in Oryen have already reaped impressive 250% returns, even though the ICO phase is still in its start. While ORY has been successfully surviving the bear market, many other cryptocurrencies, such as Fantom, Elrond, and Decentraland, have not. Oryen (ORY) The price of ORY has increased from $0.05 in the first pre-sale phase to $0.175 in the sixth pre-sale phase. Darryl Boo is an expert on cryptocurrencies and declares that the people who made Oryen made an interesting protocol with good ways to keep the money. He stated that people who make cryptocurrencies are holding on to Oryen because of its skyrocketing price. Below is a table that summarises ORY\u2019s performance and future expectations. Presale Phase Date Price Increase ORY Price Purchase Bonus Presale 5 23 Nov \u2014 02 Dec 200% $0.15 7% Presale 6 02 Dec \u2014 09 Dec 250% $0.175 5% Presale 7 09 Dec \u2014 16 Dec 320% $0.21 5% Presale 8 16 Dec \u2014 23 Dec 400% $0.25 5% Presale 9 23 Dec \u2014 27 Dec 500% $0.3 0% \u00a0 Regarding staking, the Oryen Autostaking Technic (OAT) is the only one of its kind in the cryptocurrency world. It has an automated staking system that is easy to understand and guarantees a constant APY of 90%. SolidProof has gone through and checked each Oryen smart contract. Oryen has a low starting price of $0.35, no vesting, and is airdropped directly to holders\u2019 wallets. It ensures that everyone who contributes to an ICO has the same chance to make money during the presale phase of the token sale. Fantom Blockchain networks like Fantom were developed to serve as Ethereum substitutes by providing decentralized, permissionless, open-source contract platforms for dApps and digital assets. Fantom goes down in the bear market and is not stable. Elrond The cryptocurrency Elrond (EGLD) is built on blockchain technology that can process transactions gradually. Elrond allows for decentralized applications to be made with the help of smart contracts and uses the EGLD token, which is called eGold. In contrast to ORY, whose price has gone up despite the bear market, Elrond is one of the coins that won\u2019t survive the ongoing recession. Because of Oryen\u2019s reliability, many Elrond holders have switched to ORY. Decentraland Decentraland is an application built on Ethereum whose goal is to pay its community of users for managing a centralized online space. In Decentraland, you can buy and sell virtual property, and the platform also lets you meet new people, play games, and go on adventures. When the price of ORY went up amazingly by 250%, Investors of Decentraland became interested in it. FTX severely damaged Decentraland\u2019s stability, and investors, as a result, rejected it and turned to ORY. Closing Thoughts Oryen could develop into a compelling currency. The 250% ROI it provided its early backers proves the network\u2019s success and the value it plans to bring to the industry. ORY is a cryptocurrency worth considering for any investor due to its cutting-edge technology and competent team.

    "content": "The current bearish season in the market has significantly decreased the likelihood of most coins becoming bullish. The best bet, however, tends to be pre-sale tokens with novel use cases like Dash 2 Trade (D2T), as many investors are now shifting their investments there. A little over $8 million has been raised during the active D2T token presale. (D2T) is an integrated analytics platform that provides market-beating intelligence and features to advance your trading career. The presale dashboard beta launch has been delayed due to the addition of more team members. While Polygon is still in an indecisive phase, the bulls might storm the market once the Moving Average flips bullish. Conversely, GMX is in an uptrend, but investors might be entering late as the $55.3700 resistance is very close. However, Dash 2 Trade (D2T) remains promising because it is still in its early stages. Investing in D2T will likely be more profitable than investing in both MATIC and GMX combined. MATIC/USD is now consolidating within a triangle pattern. A breakout from either side of the triangle is impending. A successful breakout from the triangle pattern to the upside might eventually cause more bulls to storm the market until the diagonal resistance is also broken. Instead of waiting for a successful breakout, it is better to invest in (D2T) due to its appealing features and novel use case. After GMX/USD executed buy orders from the discount array of the previous trading range, the price kept expanding upward. The previous trading range was defined by the $36.2750 and $48.1410 price levels. The price is expected to reach the \u201350% Fibonacci retracement level before correcting to the downside. began to fluctuate in price on November 22, 2022, as the bulls built up their buy orders. TAMA/USD is currently expected to execute the buy orders in the bullish order block and then break the diagonal resistance successfully. Everyone can take part in a more sustainable and environmentally friendly world thanks to the Impact Token ( ). Investment in the project is now a great opportunity. About $13.5 million has been made thus far from the ongoing IMPT presale. You can also join their channel.",

Ripple has filed a redacted response to the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s opposition to its motion for summary judgment, as disclosed in a tweet by pro-Ripple lawyer James K. Filan yesterday. #XRPCommunity #SECGov v. #Ripple #XRP BREAKING: Ripple has filed its Redacted Reply to the SEC's Opposition to Ripple's Motion for Summary Judgment. https://t.co/wl99qNTFvL \u2014 James K. Filan \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddea 126k (beware of imposters) (@FilanLaw) December 2, 2022 It is worth noting that it marks the final submission of the blockchain payments company in its legal battle with the SEC. Consequently, all that is left is to wait for Judge Analisa Torres\u2019 ruling. As previously reported , Filan expects this ruling to come on or before the end of March 2023. In the 56-page long document (if you exclude the introductory pages) seen by The Crypto Basic , Ripple argues that the SEC has failed to show that the statutes of Howey\u2019s test apply to Ripple\u2019s sales of XRP from 2013 to 2020. Noting that the burden lies on the SEC to do so, and it has so far failed to do so, it asserts that the SEC is seeking that the court redefines these statutes. \u201cThe SEC\u2019s position boils down to a view that any time someone buys an asset hoping to make money, and the seller\u2019s interests are even partly aligned with the buyer\u2019s, it is a security subject to registration,\u201d Ripple surmises at the end of its opening statement. \u201cThat is not the law, even if the seller uses the sales proceeds to run its business. If Congress wants to expand the securities laws that way, it can do so; but this Court should not.\u201d Ripple has been straight with the court, unlike the SEC, Ripple General Counsel Stuart Alderoty commented on the submission. According to the Ripple lawyer, the team is proud of the defense it has mounted, not just in defense of Ripple but the entire crypto industry. This is our final submission where we ask the court to grant judgment in our favor. After two long years, Ripple is proud of the defense we\u2019ve mounted on behalf of the entire crypto industry. We have always played it straight with the Court. Can\u2019t say the same for our adversary. \u2014 Stuart Alderoty (@s_alderoty) December 2, 2022 Attorney John E. Deaton, who represents thousands of XRP holders in the legal battle as a friend of the court (amicus curiae) while admitting that he is yet to read the document, highlighted that Ripple lawyers cited the XRP holders\u2019 brief four times in the submission. In addition, he also says that the Ripple team twice cited the nearly 3000 affidavits from XRP holders. It bears mentioning that the legal battle between the regulator and the payments firm has spanned nearly two years, causing pain to many XRP holders as the SEC alleges that the crypto is an unregistered security. Moreover, several pundits believe that the case will likely set a precedent that could expand the SEC\u2019s role in crypto regulations to the detriment of the emerging industry if the court rules in favor of the regulator.

We just want to keep it going.\"Pascal Siakam had 24 points and 11 rebounds and O.G. Anunoby added 21 points for the Raptors, losers of two straight games. It was the second consecutive game that Toronto was down by at least 31 points.\"We got punched in the mouth,\" said Fred VanVleet, who added 10 points. \"And waited (until) we were down 30 points to fight back, which was a little too late. That's just part of being professional and being ahead of punching, being more physical and just being more aggressive and on your toes to start the game.\"Brooklyn led by 36 points midway through the second quarter and held a 93-72 advantage at the start of the fourth.The Raptors rattled off 11 straight points to pull within 110-103 after Scottie Barnes' dunk with 37 seconds left.Durant was then fouled on the next possession and hit a pair of free throws. Anunoby missed a 3-pointer and Seth Curry knocked down a pair of free throws to seal the victory.Brooklyn has won all three games against the Raptors this season.Irving and Joe Harris combined for 31 points to help the Nets take a 72-49 lead at halftime. Brooklyn's 72 first-half points were a season high as they shot 28 for 48 from the field and 8 for 17 from long distance.\"We talked about it before, who was going to hit first, and we hit first,\" Nets coach Jacque Vaughn said.Brooklyn raced out to a 41-17 lead in the first quarter. Siakam hit a pair of free throws with 8:01 to play and Irving answered by initiating 15-0 run with a basket before T.J. Warren \u2014 playing for the first time in nearly two years \u2014 capped it with a pullup jumper to extend the lead 32-10 lead with 3:38 remaining. The Raptors missed seven shots and turned over the ball three times during a stretch of five minutes before Thaddeus Young hit a jumper.TIP-INSRaptors: Toronto has lost three straight games on the road. \u2026 Barnes had 15 points and Gary Trent Jr. added 16 off the bench.Nets: Brooklyn's previous high for points in the first half was 69 against New York on Nov. 9. IT'S BEEN A LONG TIMEWarren was back on the court for the first time in two years, coming off the bench in the first quarter with 4:14 left and got his first shot to fall on his first attempt a minute later. The 29-year-old forward had not played in a game since Dec. 29, 2022, while he was with Indiana, due to multiple stress fractures on his left foot.Warren said it took him two to four months to recover following both surgeries, which he said was a \"difficult process dealing\" with.Warren led the Pacers with 19.8 points per game during the 2019-20 season and enjoyed a breakout performance in the NBA bubble, averaging 31 points, including a 53-point outburst. He hopes his addition to the rotation would be a boost to a team that has struggled during the early on this season and entered play Friday night just one game over .500.\"Just effort, my ability to be versatile out there, just be a two-way player, something I took pride in since coming in the NBA, just being able to guard multiple guys and just be able to be that three-level scorer at the same time and just try to feed off guys that just play hard,\" Warren said.Warren had 10 points in 17 minutes.

    "description": "The murder of an Indigenous man in the Amazon shows how the struggle to save the rainforest in Brazil can turn deadly",
    "content": "In the south of the Amazon, just where two dirt roads cross, is a small bar, set back a bit from the highway. There\u2019s no name over the door because it\u2019s part of a house, really, but everyone calls it Guiga\u2019s bar, after its owner. Like many of the bars dotted across the region, Guiga\u2019s is ramshackle and no-frills. There\u2019s a pool table along one side and a few tables and chairs out front, but that\u2019s it. People go to get some shade, grab a beer, and swap local gossip, not for the d\u00e9cor or ambience. The last known whereabouts of Ari Uru-Eu-Wau-Wau was in Guiga\u2019s bar, sometime before midnight on April 18, 2020. Ari was a member of the Uru-Eu-Wau-Wau Indigenous people, and he\u2019d spent that evening drinking in a series of bars scattered along the unpaved roads near the group\u2019s reservation. The next morning his body was found at the side of a road around half an hour away. His head was caked with blood that had dried quickly in the searing heat. His phone was nestled in the grass a few feet away. On the sides of the road were walls of grass, and behind that were fields where the mighty Amazon rain\u202fforest had once stood. [time-brightcove not-tgx=\u201dtrue\u201d] The story of Ari Uru-Eu-Wau-Wau, and the investigation into his murder, is in one way the story of Brazilian Indigenous peoples: their genocide, their daily struggles in a hostile world, and their fight for justice. But it\u2019s also a contemporary tale, of climate change, Brazil, and the influence of Jair Bolsonaro, the recently defeated Brazilian President whose disregard for the Amazon and its inhabitants has led the whole planet to the edge of environmental Armageddon. Indigenous people have been under siege since Bolsonaro took power four years ago, and the Amazon has borne the brunt of his neglect. Deforestation, land grabs, and violence are up; equality, credibility, and empathy are down. People like the Uru-Eu-Wau-Wau have good reason to lament the former army captain\u2019s reign. It was in the 1970s, as the military forged a path into the untouched part of the jungle, that the Uru-Eu-Wau-Wau first came into recorded contact with a Brazil they had never hoped to meet. The Amazon was (and still is) Brazil\u2019s Wild West, and the military dictators of the time saw it as a weak spot, a vast frontier coveted by bigger geopolitical powers and vulnerable to outside invasions. It was also an El Dorado, a treasure trove of metals, jewels, plants, animals, and raw materials ripe for the picking. So the military sent diggers to cut roads into the forest and encouraged people to go down them and plant a flag for the fatherland. In the slogan of the time, they offered \u201ca land without men for men without land,\u201d and millions took them up on it. It spelled disaster for the Uru-Eu-Wau-Wau and hundreds of other Indigenous groups. Today, the Uru-Eu-Wau-Wau number only around 200, most of whom live in six communities scattered around a 1.8\u202fmillion-hectare reservation in Rond\u00f4nia, one of nine Brazilian states that make up the Amazon. The territory is being squeezed on all sides by loggers and ranchers. And it\u2019s that pressure, say the Uru-Eu-Wau-Wau, that led to the death of Ari, a schoolteacher and leader, taken at the age of just 35. Killing Indigenous people got easier in Brazil these past few years. Before taking office, Bolsonaro vowed not to give them \u201cone more centimeter of land,\u201d and he was true to his word. Bolsonaro hollowed out the state agency charged with protecting Indigenous groups, known as FUNAI, and he let environmental agencies rot, starving them of funds and staff, and deliberately creating conditions for loggers, miners, ranchers, and hunters to invade with impunity. Deforestation has gone up every year since he took power, this year hitting a 15-year high. An astonishing 99% of all deforestation in 2021 contained indications of illegality, according to a study by MapBiomas. Violence has soared, and Indigenous people feel under siege. Even though reservations are fenced off\u2014to keep the invaders out, not to keep the native people in\u2014invasions by hunters and prospectors after land, gold, timber, and fish went from 109 in 2018 to 305 last year, according to Cimi, an Indigenous-rights group. The Amazon is now home to all kinds of opportunists, from small farmers grabbing a parcel of land to make a home and plant a few bananas, to international crime syndicates taking advantage of the vacuum. \u201cDrug-trafficking organizations, arms-trafficking organizations, illegal fishing and hunting organizations, they are all operating in the Amazon now,\u201d says Suely Ara\u00fajo, a former head of Ibama, the conservation and sustainable-development arm of the Ministry of the Environment. And yet being in the Amazon is magical. On a river, in absolute silence bar the hum of the motor and the water lapping the sides of the boat; in the undergrowth, surrounded by shafts of yellow light and the pungent smell of wet soil; at night, below skies with so many stars, they seem to light up the ground beneath them. Protecting these wonders became so much harder under Bolsonaro. The whole point of FUNAI, whose forerunner was set up in 1910, is to secure land for the most endangered Indigenous groups and then monitor the reservations to ensure invaders are kept out. Its mission statement is to \u201cprotect and promote the rights of Brazil\u2019s Indigenous peoples.\u201d But when Bolsonaro starved it of funds, the opportunists poured in, often telling anyone who challenged them the President had their backs. It was a shock to people like Ari and Bitat\u00e9, the Uru-Eu-Wau-Wau\u2019s 22-year-old leader, and they instinctively knew they had to react. Now, when they get word of illegal deforestation on their land, they don\u2019t just inform FUNAI. They pack their bags, power up their drones, and set out to resolve the problem. They do so as members of the guardians of the forest, a cross between a patrol and a pressure group. Indigenous people across Brazil have formed similar troupes over the past 10 years as a way to combat encroachment and destruction. Using modern technology to delineate their land, and traditional tools to protect themselves, it is one of the few ways they can actively defend the place they call home. When news of incursions came in, Ari gathered at dawn with other Uru-Eu-Wau-Wau guardians, and together they would hike into the forest, backpacks over one shoulder, bows and arrows over the other. They knew the invaders were dangerous\u2014\u201cWe are always being threatened,\u201d says Bitat\u00e9\u2014but drones helped them see what they were dealing with from afar. If the invaders were alone, or unarmed, they could scare them off or even, in rare cases, hand them over to police. Sometimes they settled for destroying the shacks the invaders holed up in; other times they would make off with their food or stove or, if they were really lucky, with their chain\u202fsaws. Often they needed just to make their presence felt for the invaders to retreat. \u201cAri used to say, \u2018We are survivors. This is our land. This is where we are from,\u2019\u201d Bitat\u00e9 says. \u201cHe wanted to protect it not just for himself but for his children and his grandchildren. When he died, we lost someone who was always on the front lines, someone who said, \u2018We must not bow our heads.\u2019\u201d There are, finally, reasons for optimism. On Oct. 30, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva was elected President, defeating Bolsonaro. The Amazon and climate were two of the recurring themes of the campaign, and Lula has promised to repeat the success from a decade ago when his government reduced deforestation by more than 80%. Most notably for the Uru-Eu-Wau-Wau, Lula has vowed to give Indigenous people more control over their own affairs. \u201cGet ready, Brazil\u2019s Indigenous people, because I am going to create a Ministry for Native Peoples,\u201d he said in August. \u201cGet ready, because FUNAI will no longer be run by a white man with green eyes. It will be run by an Indigenous man or woman.\u201d Downie has been reporting about Brazil and the Amazon for more than 20 years. A TIME Studios documentary about Uru-Eu-Wau-Wau, The Territory, premiered on the National Geographic Channel on Dec. 1 and will stream on Disney+",

The partnerships come as the stakeholders share a common belief to reduce their carbon footprint while helping to ease the climate change crisis. Amazon was among the first to sign up to IMPT project\u2019s , enabling consumers and businesses to acquire to offset their footprint. When you shop using the IMPT web widget or mobile app, your chosen participating retailer will donate a portion of the purchase amount to a vetted green project. IMPT is the native token of revolutionary carbon-offsetting and carbon credits trading platform, IMPT.io. The platform is nearing the end of its pre-sale stage, having recorded one of the most successful results in the history of crypto pre-sales, more than $13.5 million in IMPT tokens sold. As IMPT is an ERC-20 token, it is compliant with the Ethereum blockchain that provides a hub for hundreds of top-quality tokens. In the last run of the pre-sale, the IMPT team has called investors to claim tokens beginning December 12. The initial exchange offering (IEO) is slated for December 14, 2022, leaving interested investors only until December 11, 2022, to buy into the project at a lower price \u2013 . Once the pre-sale is over on December 11, early investors will have just about 48 hours to claim their tokens before the initial exchange offering. Current investors are now looking at one week to buy tokens for $0.023, and given that the tokens have no vesting period, investing $100 will give you 4,347 IMPT tokens. Renowned decentralized exchange (DEX) Uniswap will host IMPT token\u2019s IEO and its listing on centralized exchanges (CEXs) LBank and Changelly Pro on a date scheduled for confirmation. Beginning December 14, however, users can actively trade on the Uniswap DEX. For investors looking to jump in the IMPT project while the pre-sale is still on, this is the time. To buy IMPT token, connect a crypto wallet at IMPT.io and buy IMPT using ETH or Tether stablecoin USDT. However, if you do not have ETH, you can safely buy IMPT token using a card on the IMPT site, and thereafter make your IMPT token purchase. During pre-sale 1, IMPT was selling for $0.018, before the price went up in pre-sale 2 at $0.023 and will be the last price leading to the IEO. Any left-over pre-sale tokens will be burnt, and tokens previously allocated to presale 3 will be locked for the next 12 months. Upon the beginning of the public trading, there is bound to be a robust price surge for the IMPT token, attributed to the uniqueness of the product offering and how it bolsters the biggest investment them in the century, Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG). Accordingly, . IMPT is an innovative and unique project serving to help users acquire carbon credits while shopping. The credits have several use cases, including investing and supporting various environmental projects and charities after vetting and approval. Other use cases include selling or holding carbon credits as an investment asset. Alternatively, a user can retire the credits. According to the project whitepaper, those who burn their credits get unique NFTs in return. At the heart of the IMPT project is to make individuals and businesses more environmentally friendly and conscious. To this end, the project looks to establish a global score to measure their impact on carbon footprint. Read more:",

It\u2019s worth noting that developers on XRP Ledger took a \u201cno smart contract approach\u201d in their NFT implementation. So, this measure reduces the vulnerability of NFTs on the network. It also means that its NFTs are unlikely to cause network congestion, compared to smart contract platforms such as Ethereum and Solana. Moreover, it also allows NFTs to be jointly owned by individuals. With developments such as the , the EVM-compatible sidechain, and the Native AMM, the XRP Ledger is on the cusp of becoming a major decentralized finance (DeFi) competitor, using its security and scalability as an edge.",

    "content": "NEW YORK -- Nine people, mostly firefighters, suffered minor injuries as a 5-alarm fire tore through the top floor and roof of an apartment building overnight in Hamilton Heights.The fire started at around 1:30 a.m., when most people who live there were fast asleep, CBS2's Christina Fan reported Saturday.\u00a0Firefighters spent hours battling heavy flames on top of the 6-story apartment complex on West 141st Street and Broadway. Families grabbed what they could before making a quick escape.\u00a0\"We have a sound machine on when we sleep and so it wasn't until like 20 minutes after everything started. I smelled smoke and I opened the door and saw firefighters running down our hallway, and I got my husband up and got our cats into their carriers, and got our backpacks on and got out,\" one woman said.\u00a0About 200 firefighters and EMTs responded, but the flames quickly spread through the cockloft and reduced the top floors to rubble.\u00a0\"It didn't take that long for it to spread from one side of the building to the other. So I'm assuming probably because it's windy outside and what kind of fire it was probably also factored in as well. But in my whole time living here I've never seen a fire like this before. This was pretty bad,\" said neighbor Jesse Liriano.\u00a0About an hour before the fire started, a neighbor reportedly called 911 to report smoke on the 6th floor. Yahaira Paulina, president of the tenant's association, said the firefighters who responded left without finding the source.\u00a0\"They investigated, they didn't find anything. They didn't break or move anything, they just turned off the breaker,\" said Paulina.\u00a0The FDNY confirmed they received a call just before midnight. The incident was closed out at 12:32 a.m. after a thorough investigation and no visible signs of smoke or fire, officials said.\u00a0\"I think if they had done better due diligence at the first try, then possibly it wouldn't have had an hour to spread the way it spread,\" said Paulina.\u00a0According to the FDNY, seven firefighters and two tenants suffered minor injures. Officials said every floor was likely damaged to some extent.\u00a0\"Fire damage is limited to that top floor but of course we use a lot of water to put out these fires and there will be water damage throughout,\" said FDNY Chief of Department John Hodgens.\u00a0Displaced families said the Red Cross is helping them find temporary accommodations. As for the building, inspectors are checking to see if it is still structurally sound.\u00a0The cause of the fire is under investigation.\u00a0",

    "content": "BEIJING \u2014 Chinese authorities on Saturday announced a further easing of COVID-19 curbs with major cities such as Shenzhen and Beijing no longer requiring negative tests to take public transport. The slight relaxation of testing requirements comes even as daily virus infections reach near-record highs, and follows weekend protests across the country by residents frustrated by the rigid enforcement of anti-virus restrictions that are now entering their fourth year, even as the rest of the world has opened up. The southern technological manufacturing center of Shenzhen said Saturday that commuters no longer need to show a negative COVID-19 test result to use public transport or when entering pharmacies, parks and tourist attractions. [time-brightcove not-tgx=\u201dtrue\u201d] Meanwhile, the capital Beijing said Friday that negative test results are also no longer required for public transport from Monday. However, a negative result obtained within the past 48 hours is still required to enter venues like shopping malls, which have gradually reopened with many restaurants and eateries providing takeout services. The requirement has led to complaints from some Beijing residents that even though the city has shut many testing stations, most public venues still require COVID-19 tests. Despite easing measures, authorities said that the \u201czero-COVID\u201d strategy \u2014 which aims to isolate every infected person \u2014 is still in place. On Saturday, Beijing authorities said that because the current round of COVID-19 was spreading fast, it is necessary to \u201cunswervingly continue to implement normalized social prevention and control measures.\u201d The government reported 33,018 domestic infections in the past 24 hours, including 29,085 with no symptoms. As the rest of the world has learned to live with the virus, China remains the only major nation still sticking to a \u201czero-COVID\u201d strategy. The policy, which has been in place since the pandemic started, led to snap lockdowns and mass testing across the country. China still imposes mandatory quarantine for incoming travelers even as its infection numbers are low compared to its 1.4 billion population. The recent demonstrations, the largest and most widely spread in decades, erupted Nov. 25 after a fire in an apartment building in the northwestern city of Urumqi killed at least 10 people. That set off angry questions online about whether firefighters or victims trying to escape were blocked by locked doors or other anti-virus controls. Authorities denied that, but the deaths became a focus of public frustration. The country saw several days of protests across cities including Shanghai and Beijing, with protesters demanding an easing of COVID-19 curbs. Some demanded Chinese President Xi Jinping step down, an extraordinary show of public dissent in a society over which the ruling Communist Party exercises near total control. Xi\u2019s government has promised to reduce the cost and disruption of controls but says it will stick with \u201czero COVID.\u201d Health experts and economists expect it to stay in place at least until mid-2023 and possibly into 2024 while millions of older people are vaccinated in preparation for lifting controls that keep most visitors out of China. While the government has conceded some mistakes, blamed mainly on overzealous officials, criticism of government policies can result in punishment. Former NBA star Jeremy Lin, who plays for a Chinese team, was recently fined 10,000 yuan ($1,400) for criticizing conditions in team quarantine facilities, according to local media reports. On Friday, World Health Organization emergencies director Dr. Michael Ryan said that the U.N. agency was \u201cpleased\u201d to see China loosening some of its coronavirus restrictions, saying \u201cit\u2019s really important that governments listen to their people when the people are in pain.\u201d",

    "content": "The casino industry is as pompous as it gets. With billions of dollars worth of transactions made daily across the globe, it isn\u2019t surprising that the industry has been thriving. This sector has been around for centuries and seems to only grow further in the last couple of years. Infact, people have now found newer, safer, and more comfortable avenues to bet and win great rewards potentially. At the helm of innovations in this sector, is undoubtedly , which were embraced right after they were introduced to the world. From being extremely easy to access, to rewards of high amounts and attractive bonuses, crypto casinos have it all, which is mostly why enthusiasts as well as traditional casino fans seem to be so interested in the concept. Players can simply download apps or visit the website, finish a quick sign-up process and connect their wallet to win at games and make money. This kind of accessibility has become so popular, that crypto casinos keep popping up on a regular basis now. However, there is a major problem that is now being addressed by the wider casino community on several social media platforms. Crypto Casinos that aren\u2019t properly regulated or feature strong and reputed companies behind them scam people of their money, or use fraudulent software to ensure that players don\u2019t win. Despite several attempts to stop this, the problem can still persist, as more such casinos get introduced when some are cracked down. This has a very simple solution. Players just need to find casinos that can be trusted, have a good history of catering to the audience and are strictly secure. Naturally, there are several such casinos that can be enjoyed by the masses. However, some casinos cannot operate in certain geographical locations or countries. Despite casinos being legal, some top casinos may be unable to operate or may not be available to enjoy in certain countries. But this too can be worked around and is a method that many casino players have now been enjoying. The trick is to find excellent casinos that are VPN friendly. VPN or Virtual Private Network essentially manages to change your server location to a place of your desire. Now, since cryptocurrencies do not have geographical limitations when it comes to transactions, finding such VPN-friendly casinos can be a great idea to trade safely and win. At the moment, there are two crypto casinos that can be played from anywhere using VPN. They are highly reputed platforms and have a wide user base already. Launched recently, is arguably one of the best casinos available in the space currently. It is founded by the Lucky Block Foundation, which already has a cryptocurrency project of its own too with a native token called . The company has been around for several years and has positioned itself as one of the best brands to be a part of when being involved with or lottery systems. Lucky Block boasts a game library of more than 2700 by some of the most well-known game providers around. It does not require a KYC, which makes it an easy platform to access and get started. Lucky Block also hosts a sportsbook, where you can bet on popular competitions and events. A huge number of players have been flocking to enjoy betting on the ongoing using Lucky Block. Lucky Block doesn\u2019t essentially feature a bonus, which is one of the most important factors a player looks at before choosing a crypto casino. However, the two main offers it provides it\u2019s more than enough to compensate for any bonuses; which again are something that may be introduced in the future. These two things consist of a highly attractive 15% cashback, with basically no upper limit for the first seven days. This means that users can simply deposit any amount and enjoy the platform for the first seven days, and then get a 15% cash back on the money spent. Another is a 10K giveaway, which is why thousands of casino fans have been lining up to be a part of Lucky Block. This giveaway has a very simple requirement, which is to sign up and play on the Lucky Block Casino. Naturally, this has tempted a huge number of players to become a part of the platform. Surprisingly, this marketing technique by Lucky Block seems to be working great, since players get hooked to the excellent product by the casino while checking out the platform, compelling them to stay. It is a very VPN-Friendly Casino and can be played using a good VPN in countries like the US and UK without any hitches. Anyone familiar with the top crypto casinos would be aware of his platform. is an extremely popular crypto casino which has won several awards for its excellent service and features like the Crypto Casino of the Year Sigma Award in Curacao and AIBC Blockchain Gaming platform of the Year.

    "content": "The New London-Spicer football team's motto \"All Gas, No Brakes\" is a misnomer wrapped inside a misspelling. A tremendous break of their own making brought the Wildcats an improbable touchdown with no time remaining Saturday afternoon. New London-Spicer escaped with a 27-26 victory in the Class 3A Prep Bowl against Dilworth-Glyndon-Felton at U.S. Bank Stadium. Quarterback Blake Schultz threw 34 yards to junior Grant Paffrath, who caught the ball, then lateralled it to trailing senior teammate Brycen Christensen to complete a 48-yard scoring play. Paffrath and Christensen said their exchange was reactionary, not designed. \"I saw he was getting tackled, so I called his name,\" Christensen said. \"I didn't even see the end of the play,\" Paffrath said. \"I just heard everyone yelling.\" \"What I want to know is why you were behind him,\" Wildcats coach Chad Gustafson said to Christensen. \"Because I thought you were faster than him.\" A more somber Dilworth-Glyndon-Felton coach Anthony Soderberg and standout senior Jordan Summers lamented losing their grip on the outcome. On their final drive, the Rebels executed a 95-yard march and went ahead 26-21 as Summers scored with 24 seconds remaining. But second-ranked Dilworth-Glyndon-Felton (12-1) had its hopes for a first Prep Bowl title dashed. \"You're going to lose sometimes,\" said Summers, who was the deep safety on the game's final play but was unable to get to Christensen in time. \"But it's a hard one to choke down because you feel like you have it. Then you just don't.\" No. 9 New London-Spicer (11-2) failed to score on two trips inside the Rebels 10-yard line. The second one came on a loss of downs, opening the door for a Rebels rally. Summers, nagged by an injury that kept him from practicing until Friday, completed the drive and day with 33 carries for 169 yards and two touchdowns. Those miscues failed to rattle New London-Spicer. The Wildcats allowed opponents to score first in four playoff games this season. Finishing strong became an expectation. The Paffrath-to-Christensen connection, though, provided a welcome bonus. \"All these kids fought hard,\" Gustafson said. \"Those two made just one heck of a heads-up play.\"",

    "content": "(To receive weekly emails of conversations with the world\u2019s top CEOs and business decisionmakers, click here.) Fifty years ago, journalist Bob Woodward descended into a dark underground parking lot in Arlington, Virginia, for a rendezvous far too sensitive to be carried out over the phone. His covert meetings with a government source\u2014later immortalized as \u201cDeep Throat\u201d in the film All the President\u2019s Men\u2014eventually helped Woodward and his colleague Carl Bernstein blow open the Watergate scandal that would change the course of American history. In our interconnected world, underground car park meetings may appear antiquated. But together with the internet\u2019s revolution in connectivity has come an increase in surveillance \u2013 from spyware targeting journalists and activists, to governments pressuring technology corporations to hand over users\u2019 personal data. [time-brightcove not-tgx=\u201dtrue\u201d] In this new online world, the safest way to communicate is still in-person, without electronic devices. (When whistleblower Edward Snowden met with lawyers in a Hong Kong safe house in 2013, he urged them to put their cell phones in a refrigerator in a different room to prevent digital eavesdropping.) But since the latter half of the 2010s, apps marrying the convenience of digital communication with the security of an underground car-park meeting have exploded in popularity. These apps use end-to-end encryption \u2013 a mathematical way of scrambling data that makes it very easy for the sender and recipient of a message to decode it, but extremely difficult, if not impossible, for an eavesdropper to decipher. Chiefly responsible for this trend is Signal \u2013 the private messaging app employed by hundreds of millions of users. Its gold-standard encryption technology lies behind WhatsApp, used by more than 2 billion people worldwide. Unlike WhatsApp, Signal encrypts data from your contacts, whom you\u2019re messaging, when, and how often, meaning this crucial metadata \u2013 oftentimes more sensitive than the contents of messages themselves \u2013 is equally safe. As a journalist, Signal has long been one of the most important tools in my toolbox. When I can\u2019t meet my source in person, it\u2019s the next-best option for a sensitive conversation. When I last wrote about Signal, in 2020, the non-profit that runs the app was riding high. After a year of political and social instability, many dissidents and protesters had begun using Signal, amid a growing tech backlash that was also leading others to question the security of their personal data, and seek alternatives to Big Tech. I wanted to revisit Signal today, not only because it seems so much about the internet is in flux. It was also an excuse to speak with Meredith Whittaker\u2014one of the sharpest critics of Big Tech\u2014who earlier this year was appointed Signal\u2019s President. Whittaker has a storied career, from leading protests inside Google against the firm\u2019s work on military contracts to, most recently, advising FTC chair Lina Khan on the dangers of artificial intelligence. Now, Whittaker is helping lead Signal, one of the tech industry\u2019s most promising outsiders, toward long-term financial stability. At the same time, she\u2019s increasingly getting the recognition she\u2019s due as torchbearer for a radical vision: not only for an internet where the surveillance business model is recognized as inherently dangerous, but one where alternatives are abundant and easy to use. In this wide-ranging conversation, Whittaker spoke to TIME about the state of the tech landscape, where Signal is going next\u2014and don\u2019t miss her choice words about the crypto meltdown. This conversation has been condensed and edited for clarity. The internet as a whole is in a period of what seems like significant flux. Elon Musk has acquired Twitter and seems to be rewriting the rules about who can have access to large platforms. Companies like Meta are laying off large segments of their workforces. At a time where authoritarians around the globe are leveraging technology to strengthen social control, it appears Silicon Valley is turning away from the safeguards it belatedly erected to prevent these kinds of abuses. I\u2019m curious as to what you think of the environment right now. I think we are getting a really clear lesson that is bringing into stark relief the fact that what we think of as \u201ctech\u201d is a collection of companies, and they are controlled by people who have specific incentives: generally profit and growth. We have become, over the past couple of decades, dependent in pretty profound ways on computational infrastructures that are run at the whim of these companies that are, as a rule, predicated on mass surveillance. We don\u2019t have any control over it in any meaningful sense. Ultimately, they can call it a town square, all these corporate slogans that paint these products and services as socially beneficial. But I think we need to question the narrative that access to U.S. technology is inherently liberatory. We need to recognize that most of these technology companies conduct surveillance, and can be pushed by governments to turn over very, very sensitive information. We saw Apple turn off AirDrop in China recently, right before a wave of significant protests broke out. We saw Google pull the Navalny voting app from the Russian Google Play Store. Fifteen or so years ago we had the case in China where Yahoo! turned over sensitive information about dissidents that led to real personal harm \u2013 that\u2019s one of the few cases where we have all the information so we can draw that connection. I think we have to recognize that these tools are often collecting sensitive data, and that whether by interception or by coercing these companies directly, authoritarian governments can gain access to this data. What is Signal doing differently? Signal is working to provide the most widely used private messaging service on the planet. To do that, we need to invest in research and development; we also need to structure our organization differently. We don\u2019t think privacy is safe under shareholder driven corporations. So we are structured as a nonprofit. That means we don\u2019t have equity, we don\u2019t have a board breathing down our neck to increase profits and growth and we\u2019re safer from the \u2018founders take an unethical buyout\u2019 possibility than we would be otherwise. So we\u2019re not going to just sell Signal to a crypto exchange and go live on a yacht. That\u2019s not actually a possibility, even if I decided to become evil. Frankly, our operational revenue is different. We are funded by donations. And the premise there is that we are accountable to the people who rely on Signal for privacy, not to advertisers, not to customers behind the scenes who are paying for access to our users. We are directly accountable to our users. Is it sustainable? Do you have enough donations to keep yourselves going? We are just experimenting with and developing our donor-funded model. So at this point, we\u2019re fully funded by donations, but part of those donations include a 0% interest long term loan from [executive chairman of the Signal Foundation] Brian Acton. We have that generous contribution from Brian that\u2019s allowing us the room to do that. We have some large donors, and then we are ramping up the pipeline of small donors. Our focus on small donors is because we want to be directly accountable to the people who rely on Signal. And given that providing robust privacy challenges those in power, we also want sources of funding that are as hard as possible to quickly disrupt. So we don\u2019t want a single point of failure. Millions of people donating a little bit is the ideal model for us. You recently said on Twitter that Signal will be launching usernames soon. How\u2019s that going? Usernames are a feature we\u2019ve had requests for, for a long time. They\u2019re a difficult feature to build in accordance with our strict privacy promises, but we\u2019re working on them. And, you know, we\u2019re hopeful that they\u2019ll launch in the first half of 2023. What they\u2019ll do is allow people to use Signal without giving anyone else their phone number. So you can give someone your username, and someone can connect with you on Signal via your username without ever knowing your phone number. It\u2019s another layer of privacy preservation. We\u2019ve heard, particularly from journalists, or folks who use Signal in a professional or maybe more public capacity, that they want to be able to broadcast their Signal information without broadcasting their phone number. So this allows that. When I interviewed Signal\u2019s executive chairman Brian Acton in 2020, we spoke about the multi-year effort to make the app more user-friendly so that privacy doesn\u2019t require a sacrifice on the part of the user. Signal recently released Stories, the feature pioneered by Snapchat and since copied by Instagram, WhatsApp and many others. Why was it important for you to bring Stories to Signal, and have they had the uptake you\u2019d hoped for? Stories are ephemeral, ambient messages that don\u2019t demand a response, that let people share their day with folks visually. They are really, really popular, particularly in Southeast Asia and South America. And we\u2019d heard from those folks that there\u2019s a real desire; that they\u2019re a make or break feature. So we built them. We\u2019re not in the business of prescribing the tools people prefer to communicate. We\u2019re in the business of making those tools private, so people who actually use them can benefit from privacy without having to be an ascetic staring at a command line. People are using Signal Stories. We don\u2019t collect any data about people, but we can see that the feature is being used. We can\u2019t see anything about the accounts that are using it or anything that would be able to connect it back with individuals. Our goal is that everyone in the world can pick up their device, and without thinking twice about it, or even having an ideological commitment to privacy, use Signal to communicate with anyone they want. We\u2019re not growth hacking, we\u2019re not trying to optimize for engagement. We\u2019re not trying to get clicks. But we want to create that network effect of encryption, because privacy only works if the people you\u2019re talking to use it. If you don\u2019t use the app, it doesn\u2019t matter how much I care about privacy, I\u2019m not going to be able to have a private communication with you. So we really need to take a hugely expansive view and put what people actually do, what they actually want, at the center of that. We\u2019re not in the business of educating people until, browbeaten, they understand that privacy is important. We\u2019re in the business of putting something in their hands they can use intuitively, that will genuinely protect their privacy, whether or not they believe it is important. For so many years, the network effect has been one of the key dynamics keeping power in the hands of the giant tech corporations. If all your friends are on Facebook and Instagram it\u2019s very hard to quit those services, even if you disagree with the business model or wish for better online spaces. I love the idea of subverting that dynamic and using it for privacy-protecting purposes. But on the other hand \u2013 and I don\u2019t know if these ideas are slightly contradictory or not \u2013 the research you guys are doing is open source. Even as you\u2019re building your own network effect, you\u2019re not digging a moat to keep out competitors. You\u2019re building an architecture that other people can take and freely integrate into their own services. Yeah, absolutely. The Signal Protocol is the canonical example. It is the gold standard for messaging encryption. It was a significant and groundbreaking contribution to the field of cryptography. And it\u2019s what WhatsApp uses, it\u2019s what Google has used to encrypt their own messaging systems. We also developed methods for group chats, that means we don\u2019t know who\u2019s sending a message to whom. That metadata protection deserves almost more emphasis than the encryption of the messages themselves. Our goal is to know as little as possible, and we\u2019re constantly pushing the boundaries of how little is possible. As a general rule we open source our code, and we have a wonderful and robust community of people who are like, scrutinizing it, or validating it, who are finding issues and raising them in a ticket on our GitHub. So a key element there is that you don\u2019t have to take our word for it. The lack of trade secrecy and a lack of obscurity means that it\u2019s actually validated. Curveball question here: quantum computing seems to be advancing very fast. And one of the risks of that is that at some point in the future, it will become possible for quantum computers to easily decrypt even material that is currently very strongly encrypted under current state-of-the-art protocols. No one knows when, so there\u2019s quite a lot of uncertainty. How is Signal thinking about that risk? We are investing in research to update the Signal protocol for post-quantum. It\u2019s long term, slow burn research work that isn\u2019t always publicized, but that we continue to do. But post quantum robustness for the protocol and the other encryption methods we use is definitely something we\u2019re working on. The hope and the plan is to roll that out before it\u2019s necessary, so there\u2019s no gaps. I\u2019m not a cryptographer, and I don\u2019t spend all my time in the literature here. But I think the answer of \u2018when\u2019 is very much up in the air, based on what I do understand. There is a tech hype cycle playing fast and loose with terms like quantum computing, even as it\u2019s very true that quantum is progressing, and we do need to be responsible and make the required investment to ensure we\u2019re prepared. Signal is currently beta-testing a way to transfer MobileCoin, a type of cryptocurrency that allows for anonymous payments, within the Signal app. But with the whole FTX collapse, and the increased scrutiny on crypto\u2019s use case as a vehicle for money laundering, and for increasing the wealth of the wealthiest at the expense of some of the poorest in society \u2013 is crypto still something that Signal wants to connect its name and its reputation to? I mean, look, crypto is a vehicle for extremely risky securities trading. Most of the money goes through centralized exchanges. A lot of these exchanges don\u2019t seem to be capitalized. This is a moment in crypto where I think it\u2019s becoming clear that a lot of what was valorized as technical innovation is more akin to securities fraud. Crypto is a shitshow right now. But the goal of enabling people who are unbanked, or outside of traditional economies, to make payments securely is one that I do agree with. We\u2019ve seen folks be deplatformed from major credit card platforms. The technological mechanisms that are centralizing surveillance around financial transactions, have been used to deplatform sex workers or others, and render them unable to live. So I believe that cash and other forms of anonymous payments need to exist, because the coercive power of financial surveillance at the level that we\u2019re seeing is dangerous and can lead to forms of social control that can be extremely dangerous. But I think we\u2019re watching crypto at a moment where a lot of the mask is off. Signal is not MobileCoin. Signal is a separate organization. Mobile coin is a very, very experimental integration [into Signal]. But again, I will say, you know, Signal\u2019s core focus is private messaging. I think anonymous payments are a necessary service. But currently crypto is a shit show that we are observing carefully.",

Portia connects with Jack (Leo Woodall), an easygoing English lad whose uncle Quentin (Tom Hollander) is weaving a similar spell on Tanya. For his part, Albie finds comfort in the arms of Lucia (Simona Tabasco), at first unaware (then unconcerned) that she is a sex worker who slept with his dad a few days earlier.</p> <p>Richardson strongly believes the relationship would only get worse if they tried to make it happen. \u201cI do think that in another world, Albie could be so great for Portia in so many ways, but she would also just ruin him,\u201d the actor said. \u201cThere would be so much resentment there.\u201d\u00a0</p> <h2 id=\"h-what-s-next-for-portia-and-albie\">What\u2019s next for Portia and Albie?</h2> <figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\"> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\"I felt like there is a part of her that sees how safe and nice this could be.\" <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/TheWhiteLotus?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#TheWhiteLotus</a> star Haley Lu Richardson felt \"emotional\" as Portia watching Albie with Lucia: <a href=\"https://t.co/Vd2pNFnpWz\">https://t.co/Vd2pNFnpWz</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/kvwJSTfyZ0\">pic.twitter.com/kvwJSTfyZ0</a></p>\u2014 Decider (@decider) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/decider/status/1594700004027170818?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 21, 2022</a></blockquote><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script> </div></figure> <p>Portia and Albie\u2019s bliss with their new partners did not last very long.</p> <p>Portia travels to Palermo to spend more time with Jack in Quentin\u2019s mansion. What starts as a passionate day trip takes a turn for the weird when Jack forces them to skip out on a meal, saying he forgot his wallet. Then, Jack drops her off at her room at the end of the night, saying that he has to \u201cdo something for his uncle.\u201d That something is the big revelation of the episode. Tanya walks through the manor late at night and walks in on Jack and Quentin having sex. Suffice it to say, Portia likely isn\u2019t aware.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Albie realizes what Lucia\u2019s profession is and remains enthralled with her vibe. But knowing the business side of their relationship doesn\u2019t make things any less murky. Lucia tells him about a man named Alessio who is shaking her down for money and the fact that Cameron (Theo James) owes her cash from their previous night. Is she being vulnerable with him because she views Albie as a potential meal ticket? Or do they have a real emotional connection to each other? Considering the show, it\u2019s probably a mixture of both.\u00a0</p> <p>This season of\u00a0<em>The White Lotus\u00a0</em>began with dead bodies being fished out of the ocean and most of the cast remains a plausible suspect (or <a href=\"https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/3-characters-most-likely-die-white-lotus-season-2.html/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">victim</a>) of the crime.

The technical signal we have described in our previous articles is considered one of the strongest indicators of an upcoming trend reversal. Even though Dogecoin is not the most stable asset on the market, the cross between the 200- and the 50-day moving averages might become fuel for the market independently. As the long-term reversal sign occurs, more investors and whales might want to get more exposure to the meme coin and fuel further growth of the asset. Unfortunately, the trading volume does not suggest a spike in buying activities, but it might be a matter of time. window.coinzilla_display = window.coinzilla_display || []; var c_display_preferences = {}; c_display_preferences.zone = \"5335d7792eb489ae565\"; c_display_preferences.width = \"300\"; c_display_preferences.height = \"250\"; coinzilla_display.push(c_display_preferences); Ads window.coinzilla_display = window.coinzilla_display || []; var c_display_preferences = {}; c_display_preferences.zone = \"5335d7792eb489ae565\"; c_display_preferences.width = \"300\"; c_display_preferences.height = \"250\"; coinzilla_display.push(c_display_preferences); Ads The recovery of the market based on the Fed's dovish talk could become another reason behind DOGE's growth, but, at the same time, the unpredictable nature of the crypto market at this point should be considered a major risk factor that may cause Dogecoin's place to change in a matter of days or even hours. Related Elon Musk Reaffirms Support for Dogecoin, DOGE Price Rallies Profitability around 60% is also a healthy factor for Dogecoin's price, as it is the middle ground between the oversold and overbought states of the meme coin. Up until 80% profitability, DOGE will have enough room for growth and will not face any issues from a holder composition perspective. At press time, Dogecoin is trading at the $0.1 price threshold and has gained 4.6% to its value in the last 24 hours.",

    "content": "Since November 10 in the , when the bull market was rejected at $6691 and fell below the resistance, neither the demand line nor the supply line could make any progress as both sides became evenly matched. But towards the end of November, the bull market began to gain momentum. And within the first three days of December, the bullish price came above the major resistance level which is $6691. But so far, the bull market is not doing well above the $6691 price level. The bullish price is facing immense pressure after breaking the resistance level. And because of that, we may not regard the market to have broken out of the deadlock yet. The RSI line continues to measure the momentum of the market in the midrange as the bullish price remains stagnant due to the pressure. However, because of the slight upper hand that the bulls are having, the Bollinger indicator appears to be moving slightly to the upside as it, yet, continues to maintain a narrow price channel. The bulls seem to be succumbing to the bearish resistance. However, the forces of demand behind the price movement prevent the sellers from taking the price too far. With a new higher support level and an unmovable resistance level like this one, the bull market may be weakening. And a bearish price breakout may be imminent. Most traders did not like it when the market ranges for a long time (such as what is happening in the YFI market) because of the difficult liquidity of assets. But, with recent experience in the crypto market, innovators are devising systems that will help traders get the most out of the market.

    "content": "Amsterdam, Netherlands, 5th December, 2022, Chainwire Pioneering startup The Fabricant has gone live with its boundary-pushing digital fashion storytelling project Wholeland, with a trailer that sets the scene for a provocative world that splices digital couture, mythology and the rave scene. The ambitious move is designed to raise the bar for the wider digital fashion industry, and lead a shift in focus away from the bear market to building Web3 experiences that create long-term, high-value engagement.

    "content": "The post Bitcoin and Ethereum On-Chain Data Has Some Good News for Traders appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News A number of cryptocurrencies are currently trading in the red and Bitcoin (BTC) recently hit a two-year low.\u00a0 In such an exceptional bear market situation, the FTX crisis has only acted as fuel to fire and caused widespread distrust among the crypto participants, making them wary of investing any longer. Bitcoin is getting closer to a critical threshold, which might determine the market\u2019s short-term direction. Despite some bullish signals on the technical charts, it is still too early to say whether a new bullish phase is approaching. Active Addresses Surge A highly reliable analytics company\u2013 IntoTheBlock- has noticed a stabilization in the number of BTC and ETH active addresses, which suggests that more people are using the top two cryptocurrencies now.\u00a0 According to IntoTheBlock, one important metric is flashing a bullish signal for Ethereum and Bitcoin. After assets marked their ATH in May 2021, there was a decline in daily addresses for Ethereum and Bitcoin. The active addresses have now quickly stabilized and maintained constant levels ever since. \u201cWe see around a 36% increase in active addresses for Ethereum (327,000 addresses on March 8th, 2020 compared to 514,000 addresses on December 1st, 2022). Bitcoin has seen more modest gains with about [a] 20.6% increase in active addresses (826,000 on March 9th, 2022 compared to 1.04 million on December 1st, 2022).\u201d The market intelligence company keeps track of daily active addresses, which counts the number of wallets that have completed at least one transaction each day. According to them, wider adoption is indicated by more active addresses. The analytics company also stated that despite the unsettling macroeconomic situations, the number of active addresses for BTC and ETH has remained stable. Miner\u2019s Holdings Reduce However, Glassnode data shows that miners\u2019 BTC reserves have dropped by 13K BTC over the past several months; it is now at 1,818,280.032 BTCs, a 14-month low. In October of last year, the price reached a 14-month low of 1,818,778.794. Moreover, due to a reduction in mining activity, Bitcoin\u2019s hash rate has been decreasing as well. 10,050 #BTC (171,613,338 USD) transferred from unknown wallet to #Coinbenehttps://t.co/spzou46zNP\u2014 Whale Alert (@whale_alert) December 1, 2022 According to on-chain data on short-term inflows and outflows from Miners\u2019 wallets, there were a lot of outflows in November. It can result in a decrease in price or a rise in volatility. Miners sold over 6,000 Bitcoins the previous week and 10,000 this week.",

You can view it here https://t.co/mXEPTAvzrS\u2014 Stuart Alderoty (@s_alderoty) December 2, 2022 In a recent tweet, Ripple\u2019s general counsel- Stuart Alderoty- said that the company had submitted the paperwork for the final application. He also noted that he is glad to be working in Ripple Labs\u2019 defense because he felt the firm was working for the good of the cryptocurrency sector. Ripple Labs has further requested the SEC\u2019s grant and the judgment in its favor in this filing, in addition to other things. CEO Brad Garlinghouse wrote on Twitter, \u201cI said it on day 1, we will aggressively fight to get clear rules for the entire industry in the U.S. Congrats to all of Team Ripple for getting us to this point. Ripple stood strong and withstood the SEC\u2019s onslaught. I look forward to being on the right side of justice.\u201d SEC Fails to Identify Common Enterprise According to reports, the SEC has failed to establish the existence of an investment contract in the redacted court document from December 2. The company said that the two founders of Ripple were qualified for summary judgment over their choice to trade on foreign markets. The SEC was unable to present any relevant evidence to the contrary.\u00a0 Ripple wrote, \u201cAfter nearly two years of pleadings, discovery, and motion practice, the SEC still cannot identify the alleged \u201ccommon enterprise,\u201d cannot explain how XRP holders can meaningfully expect profits from Ripple\u2019sefforts, and cannot respond to the point that many XRP recipients invested no money at all.\u201d Ripple Labs has been able to continue this battle against the SEC, thanks to the significant support of the crypto community.",

    "description": "<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Apple\u2019s decision to remove the most popular forex and contract for difference (CFD) trading platforms from its App Store, unknowingly contributed to potentially severe changes to the retail trading industry, which has been growing for over a decade. </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">While the iconic duo of MetaTrader4 and MetaTrader5 is no longer available for iOS devices, brokers and traders are wondering what\u2019s next for the industry. Finance Magnates covers the topic in the <a href=\"https://www.financemagnates.com/intelligence/products/qir/q32022/\">latest edition of the Quarterly Industry Report</a>.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">In the long term, the inability to use the MetaQuotes app on Apple mobile devices will make brokers decide to change the platforms they offer. According to some experts, this could provide a breath of fresh air in an industry dominated by MetaTrader solutions and increase the market share of competitors.</p><p>Spotware, X Open Hub, Match-Trade and Leverate. 4 Main Alternatives</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Finance Magnates Intelligence conducted a survey, which showed that, according to traders and brokers, there are four main alternatives available in the market. Among them were platforms and white-label solutions from Spotware Systems, Match-Trade Technologies, Leverate and X Open Hub.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Finance Magnates spoke with representatives of the four companies mentioned, and all presented similar opinions. First of all, they agreed that their platforms could be the best alternative for brokers and their clients. Moreover, they do not believe the situation will negatively affect the popularity of the CFD industry among retail clients and will not increase the popularity of zero-fee trading platforms such as Robinhood.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201ccTrader is the ideal choice for brokers because it is the only complete offering in the market. Additionally, cTrader is undoubtedly the most feature-rich platform out there, offering advantages to both brokers and traders,\u201d Aris Christoforou, the Head of Marketing at Spotware Systems, said.</p><p>Your Options as a Broker</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Having MetaTrader platforms on offer still seems to be a \u2018duty\u2019 of a retail broker. Indeed, Apple\u2019s ban will not make the market share of these tools disappear entirely. However, it is worth preparing for those customers who can no longer use the MetaQuotes app on their iOS mobile devices.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Appropriate, white-label solutions are not everything. Traders, their assets and all open positions are important. When choosing a new partner as a broker, it is worth ensuring the fastest and least painful migration process to keep clients and traders unaffected.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Our interviewees repeatedly mentioned \u201cnew opportunities,\u201d \u201ca breath of fresh air,\u201d and a \u201cmix-up\u201d in the industry. As an incumbent and emerging broker, you should consider basing your offering not only on MetaQuotes platforms but also complementing it with one of the popular alternatives offered in a white-label format.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">To get the full article and the bigger picture on the future of the MetaTrader after Apple\u2019s ban, get our <a href=\"https://www.financemagnates.com/intelligence/products/qir/q32022/\">Latest Quarterly Intelligence Report</a></p> This article was written by Damian Chmiel at www.financemagnates.com.",

    "content": "According to a member of the VeChain board, Renato Grottola, the partnership allows VeChain to become the possible destination for global brands seeking to come up with digital sustainability initiatives. Grottola further explained that VeChain wants all stakeholders to contribute to common goals regarding sustainability. At the Nitto ATP Finals held between November 13 and November 20, VeChain Foundation disclosed that it is securing a multi-year partnership with the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) until 2025. This will ensure that its brand awareness is promoted in addition to the development of sustainability initiatives in Europe. ATP has a large annual viewership of an audience of over 1 billion individuals. This means VeChain can take advantage of the ATP\u2019s global reach as it seeks to expand within the continent. According to a member of the VeChain board, Renato Grottola, the partnership will allow VeChain to become the possible destination for global brands seeking to come up with digital sustainability initiatives. VeChain recognizes this sponsorship as a global platform to share evolving and fresh ideas of developments within the blockchain realm alongside pioneers, business leaders, and universities in Italy and beyond. The company announced its earlier partnership with ATP on October 18 after revealing a feature at the Nitto ATP Finals week in the Italian city of Turin. As part of its effort, the team has decided to provide the needed publicity for the VET project and also make available an appropriate marketing opportunity. After that partnership, the VeChain x Nitto ATP Finals digital collectibles collection called VeBounce was unveiled. This was in collaboration with World of V, and ExPlus. The event oversaw the minting of additional Digital Collectible prizes. This included 20 \u2018phygital\u2019 (physical-digital) prizes with CEO Sunny Lu and ex-professional Tennis star, Flavia Pennetta, signing physical tennis balls with QR codes linking to a blockchain-based NFT. VeChain wants stakeholders to contribute to sustainability On top of the upgrade, the company at the Nitto ATP Finals finished the mainnet upgrade at block 13815000 on November 17, 8:10 (UTC). This was said to be accompanied by their Proof of Authority 2.0 (PoA2.0) implementation. The seamless upgrade introduced a critical mechanic for the future of VeChain and its sustainability objectives by ensuring absolute finality and, thus, data quality assurance. According to the team, the latest network upgrade would help the VeChainThor network to comply with the upcoming data-related regulatory guidelines. This would be done while it provides proper scalability and security to fulfill the blockchain architecture technique. The strength of both blockchains would be leveraged while their respective weaknesses were eliminated. Grottola further explained that VeChain wants all stakeholders to contribute to common goals regarding sustainability. This is why VeChain wants to be the reference platform for all those who want to implement sustainability-oriented digital solutions based on blockchain. In this context, partnerships with important sports realities allow us to speak to a different target, and thus bring the issue of sustainability connected to the blockchain to the attention of ordinary people as well. VET is currently trading at $0.019 and would take a lot of effort for the price to hit $1 despite this development.

    "content": "Today, the bull market gains massive momentum to push the price from $6.8 to $8.4. This bullish move can end the down-trending market, only if buyers can manage to sustain the trend. Looking at the market over the space of two months, has been trending downwards. The bullish activities in the market were only strong enough to reduce the steep fall of the price. However, with today\u2019s bullish move, the direction of the market should change to the upside. The bandwidth of the Bollinger band began to contract as the struggle between demand and supply peaks. The Bollinger indicator illustrates the increasing proximity between the resistance level and the support level before the breakout of today\u2019s market. Today\u2019s market is very bullish, but a source of major concern is if the bulls will be able to conserve the price, as it is most likely that the bear market may respond to the bullish move in the next sessions. Looking at all the sessions that we have had so far for today, they have all been dominated by buyers. But as the bullish price approaches the $8.79 resistance level, it seems like the bull market is losing momentum. The last candle on the chart portrays the bulls holding ground against aggressive bearish resistance as they conserve an amount of the price for the fourth session of the day. The next trading session will confirm the buyers\u2019 capability to sustain the trend. With such market performance as this, it is important for investors to be ten steps ahead of events in the market so that they can make profit-yielding decisions.

    "content": "Users can receive cryptocurrency rewards through staking by either contributing assets to a pool or a contract, similar to how depositors get interest on their savings in conventional banks. (deployads = window.deployads || []).push({}); Utilizing this concept, the new DeFi startup Oryen (ORY) is generating customers an incredible passive income through its Initial Coin Offering (ICO). The price of the Oryen ICO token increased from $0.05 to $0.175 since its debut. With these next-level yields, more investors are taking note and may soon switch to ORY. Synthetix (SNX) A revolutionary derivatives trading platform called Synthetix offers members in the DeFi sector genuine investment opportunities. Synthetix (SNX) intends to be the hub of DeFi\u2019s derivatives trading and is currently making progress toward that end. (deployads = window.deployads || []).push({}); SNX has exhibited tremendous endurance during the bear run, despite being down from all-time highs of a few months or so ago. Due to its role in bringing DeFi trading prospects in line with those accessible in the mainstream financial industry and beyond, analysts believe the future is bright for SNX. GMX (GMX) GMX (GMX) offers cheap swapping costs and transactions with no price impact on its users. The GMX token serves as a governance and utility token. Additionally, GMX has a special multi-asset pool that enables liquidity providers to profit from several DeFi services, like swapping costs and leverage trading. (deployads = window.deployads || []).push({}); Avalanche and Arbitrum networks provide access to GMX (GMX). As a result, holders of GMX tokens can profit in various ways on either network. Oryen (ORY) Oryen offers a different kind of passive income. Unlike its counterparts, the Oryen Autostaking Technic (OAT) does not require ORY holders to be professionals in order to engage in staking. With a fixed annual percentage yield (APY) of 90% and a daily Return on Investment (ROI) of 0.177%, the OAT streamlines the staking procedure with ease. The Oryen Auto-staking System is the quickest cryptocurrency auto-staking protocol, transferring payouts every 60 minutes. Oryen has a launch price of $0.35, has no vesting, and is automatically airdropped to holder wallets, giving all ICO buyers an equal chance to capture pre-sale profits. Early investors in the Oryen Network, which is presently in its sixth presale round, are already making a 250% profit. These incredible advantages have made Oryen one of the best cryptocurrencies to acquire right now. (deployads = window.deployads || []).push({}); Conclusion Both beginners and seasoned cryptocurrency investors can benefit from Oryen\u2019s lifelong solution. Through automated tools that let users buy, hold, and profit from ORY\u2019s native token, investors receive market-leading incentives. In contrast to its competitors, Oryen\u2019s ICO has had consistent growth and continues to draw more GMX and SNX holders.

There are some good reasons blockchain experts and investors speculate that these two projects have a powerful potential to fetch high ROI in 2023.

Cosmos is a forward-thinking blockchain project that aims to help users use (ATOM) as more of a utility token to achieve maximum scalability and interoperability between different blockchain networks. In addition, the project is designed to offer blockchain developers the ability to build PoS (Proof-of-Stake) protocols on different blockchains.

In addition, crypto analysts also speculate that ATOM will continue to experience a consistent climb in value in the coming years, especially in 2023, thanks to its cutting-edge portfolio and use cases. (deployads = window.deployads || []).push({}); How BudBlockz is Primed for Continued Success and Why You Should Jump On The $BLUNT Bandwagon There is no question the global market for legal marijuana and cannabis products is exponentially growing. And experts claim that the CBD market will reach the $27 billion mark towards the start of 2023. Why? Well, this is mainly because a lot of countries are now embracing the use of both recreational and medicinal marijuana. And many governments will likely legalize cannabis in the coming year. BudBlockz has proven to massively capitalize on this opportunity as the platform aims to unite cannabis users and businesses by bringing them to one interoperable, transparent, and DeFi platform. In addition, BudBlockz will offer businesses and users powerful opportunities to conduct seamless transactions, allowing users to access global marijuana markets to buy and sell top-quality cannabis products. BudBlockz Will Help $BLUNT Owners Navigate the Marijuana Industry Another reason why BudBlockz is getting so popular is because the company is helping users be more informed on how the CBD industry works.

    "content": "The post Litecoin (LTC) And Dogecoin (DOGE) Struggle To Yield Profit As Snowfall Protocol (SNW) Announce 100% Bonus On Investment appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Crypto investors are becoming concerned following the collapse of the renowned crypto exchange platform FTX and the subsequent failure of Binance\u2019s takeover of FTX. Coin prices have plummeted overnight, with well-known coins such as Litecoin (LTC) and Dogecoin (DOGE) among the victims. However, the Snowfall Protocol (SNW) presale has generated so much interest recently, given its successful first round of presale. In fact, the Snowfall Protocol (SNW) team announced a 100% bonus on investment before the token\u2019s price surge next week.\u00a0\u00a0 Let\u2019s look into why crypto specialists predict the Snowfall Protocol (SNW) will be at the top of the rankings in 2023. Litecoin (LTC) Finds It Difficult To Reach Former Glory Litecoin (LTC) was designed to overcome the problems associated with expensive and time-consuming transactions. Hence, it was established as a cheaper platform for miners to work on. Litecoin (LTC) debuted at $3, but it quickly acquired value, increasing by 140% in 2020. By the end of 2021, Litecoin (LTC) was worth more than $146. However, the volatility of the bear market has affected most of crypto\u2019s big names, the price has plunged to $76.76 and doesn\u2019t appear to rise any time soon. In dire times like these, smart investors are attracted to projects like Snowfall Protocol (SNW) for their solid foundation and enormous potential to thrive in bear market conditions.\u00a0 Dogecoin (DOGE) To Witness Drastic Slumps Following the prolonged crypto winter, experts predicted a bearish movement for Dogecoin (DOGE), with a 2023 price projection of $0.000016. Dogecoin has dipped far from its peak price of $0.731578, indicating an 88.10% loss at its current price of $0.1. Dogecoin (DOGE) investors continue to sell their holdings because the meme coin\u2019s lack of utility is a drawback under harsh market situations. Meanwhile, Snowfall Protocol (SNW) has soared to unprecedented heights barely a month after its presale release, propelled by its real-world applicability to exchange fungible and non-fungible tokens. Snowfall Protocol (SNW) Offers Investors Huge Returns\u00a0 Let\u2019s start with the Snowfall Protocol (SNW) announcement which drove the crypto community into a frenzy. Snowfall Protocol has announced that all new investments will receive a 100% bonus. The announcement has had such a favorable influence on the token that it has piqued the interest of Dogecoin (DOGE) and Litecoin (LTC) investors. The Snowfall Protocol (SNW) presale\u2019s first round swiftly sold out, selling out a day early a total of 100 million tokens. The second round is bound to do the same with the team announcing they\u2019ve just raised $3 million during phase 2 presale. Many industry insiders predict that Snowfall Protocol (SNW) is about to witness a massive surge of 1000% from its current price of\u00a0 $0.075 after its second presale round. Given that Snowfall Protocol\u2019s (SNW) presale phases are well-positioned for success, now is a great time to invest in the project. Buy Snowfall Protocol (SNW) today!

    "content": "Just as expected, Apecoin sustained November\u2019s recovery up to $4.48, retested a crucial resistance, and dropped due to rejection. The break and retest successfully played out. It now primes for a fresh decrease. The bulls are exhausted, and it appears the bears are slowly stepping back into the market. After Apecoin found support in the past month, it made a U-turn and closed the month on a bearish following a break and retest pattern. The market is set for another meltdown. It is trading below the crucial resistance level of $4.2, where the orange demand-turned-supply area lies. A massive sell-off is expected in the coming weeks. Another angle to this setup is the lower low and lower high formation, which nicely respects the dynamic resistance trend line forming on the daily chart. A new lower low is in play. However, if the price fails to fall and Apecoin climbs above the descending resistance line, we should expect a quick change in trend to bullish as huge gains lies ahead. Even though it is looking bullish on the daily chart, the long bearish trajectory remains valid. The asset still holds a 12.6% gain over the past week. This gain is likely to wash away as soon as the price starts to drop significantly. It is changing hands at around $3.96 at press time. APE Price Analysis (APEUSDT): Daily Chart Source: Tradingview The big picture of the potential bearish action is becoming clearer in the lower time frame. Considering the fresh lower low, the closest support level, for now, is $3.52. After this, the next support level to keep an eye on is $3.1 and potentially $2.62 \u2013 the November support. We can consider $2 and $1.5 as the next levels to keep in mind if these support breaks. In case of a positive move, the $4.2 resistance level remains an important level for a breakout. The following resistance to keep in mind is $4.73. There\u2019s also a resistance level at $5.25. A push above this resistance would trigger huge buying pressure in the market. Key Resistance Levels: $4.2, $4.73, $5.25 Key Support Levels: $3.52, $3.1, $2.62 Spot Price: $3.96 Trend: Bullish Volatility: Low Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

    "content": "The post Ethereum Price Holds Steady At $1,300, Altcoin Toon Finance Token Soars Along With Ethereum appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Ethereum\u2019s price has been holding steady at around $1,300 in the past week. This is a significant development for the cryptocurrency, which has seen its value fluctuate wildly in recent months. Ethereum is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, and its stability is seen as a positive sign for the wider industry.\u00a0 While Ethereum\u2019s price is still far below its all-time high of over $4,000, it has recovered significantly from its low point of just $400 in July 2017. The past week has also seen a general increase in demand for cryptocurrencies, with Bitcoin and other major coins seeing their prices rise. This suggests that confidence in the cryptocurrency market is growing, and that Ethereum\u2019s recent price stability may be the start of a more sustained recovery. At the same time, altcoins have also been making gains. One of the most notable is Toon Finance Token (TFT), which has seen its price surge from basically 0 at the start of October 2022 to over $0.30 as of the last week of October.\u00a0 The project is a decentralized finance protocol built on Ethereum, and it\u2019s one of many projects that are taking advantage of the current DeFi boom. With Ethereum enjoying relative stability and increasing demand for DeFi protocols, it looks like Toon Finance Token could continue to see its price rise in the coming weeks and months.\u00a0 All in all, investors seem confident in the potential of Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies right now particularly in this case, Toon Finance. This bodes well for both Ethereum and Toon Finance as increasing prices that remain stable is always a welcome news. With this recent stability, this good news will spread to new investors making the prices rise even more and hopefully starting the bull market cycle which everyone has been waiting for. This is a good sign for the Ethereum cryptocurrency, as it indicates that investors are confident in its future Ethereum surged to a new all-time high on Wednesday within the bear market after FTX collapsed, propelled by a wave of investor and buyer confidence along with speculation for increase prices in December 2022.\u00a0 The digital currency rose to as much as $2,151.77, surpassing its previous record of $2,146.56 set on January 19. The surge comes amid a broad rally in the cryptocurrency markets, with Bitcoin also climbing to new highs. Ethereum has now gained more than 1,700 percent since the beginning of the years, far outpacing Bitcoin\u2019s gains.\u00a0 While Ethereum\u2019s rally may seem speculative, it is backed by strong fundamentals. Ethereum is one of the few altcoins with actual use and demand making the token inherently valuable apart from the fact that it is a popular token that\u2019s one of the first to attract investors both new and old to the crypto space. The Ethereum network is home to some of the most popular decentralized applications, and its native token, Ether, is used by developers to build and launch new applications. This fuels further growth as more and more use cases are found for Ethereum ETH.\u00a0 With usage and demand for Ethereum applications growing, investors are betting that the digital currency will continue to rise in value. Although there are still strong sentiments of a market bottom yet to occur, investors believe Ethereum is yet to see its new all time high (ATH). Ethereum has many advantages over other cryptocurrencies, including faster transaction times and lower fees As the world of cryptocurrency continues to evolve, Ethereum has emerged as one of the most popular platforms for digital transactions. Ethereum is very popular unlike other altcoins that\u2019s why it has a massive fan base and a lot of supporters that accept it as currency. There are also multiple platforms that use Ethereum exclusively as payment for products or services.\u00a0 Unlike Bitcoin, which strictly focuses on financial transactions, Ethereum is a more versatile system that can be used for a variety of purposes. For example, Ethereum\u2019s faster transaction times and lower fees make it ideal for small purchases, such as coffee or groceries. In addition, Ethereum is also being used more and more for larger transactions, such as real estate deals. As Ethereum grows in popularity, it is likely that even more businesses will begin to accept it as a form of payment. Consequently, Ethereum could soon become the preferred choice for digital transactions worldwide as it is not as expensive as Bitcoin which most people keep in order to wait for its price to rise. Some experts believe that Toon Finance Tokens could also become like Ethereum At the moment, the market is bombarded with new cryptocurrencies every day. Some are good, some are great and some disappear as quickly as they came. However, every once in a while, a cryptocurrency comes along that has the potential to change the game. Toon Finance Tokens could be one of those cryptocurrencies.\u00a0 While it is still early days, some experts believe that Toon Finance Tokens could also become like Ethereum, providing a platform for other digital assets and applications. Toon Finance has a platform called Toon Swap which is a decentralized exchange similar to Uniswap, Biswap, 1inch, and Pancake Swap. It will be accepting numerous token pairs such as Tether USDT, and BUSC stable coin along with other more popular coins such as Bitcoin BTC, Ethereum ETH, Cardano ADA, Polygon Matic, and Dogecoin DOGE.\u00a0 Only time will tell if Toon Finance Tokens can live up to the hype, but if it does, it could well become the next big thing in the world of cryptocurrency. This is due to the fact that decentralized exchanges are not only getting better, lessening the gap between centralized and decentralized exchanges. It is also becoming more user-friendly, thereby making it easier for people to buy and sell tokens without the need of middlemen.\u00a0 Whether Toon Finance Tokens will become a major player in the world of cryptocurrency remains to be seen. However, with its potential to revolutionize digital asset trading using its Space Bridge protocol that will allow multi-chain participation, it is certainly worth keeping an eye on this new token.\u00a0 With its growing fan base and increasing demand, there is a good chance that Toon Finance could one day become as big as Ethereum as the patterns match for the two tokens. Time will tell whether this happens or not but it is worth keeping in mind that Ethereum is currently playing around $1,300 right now and if Toon Finance Token even reaches half of this goal then it will still be a gigantic win for the investors.. Conclusion: Ethereum has established itself as one of the most popular blockchain platforms today due to its flexibility and use cases for various types of applications. While Toon Finance\u2019s Toon Swap is a result of partnership between the Ethereum blockchain and Toon Finance developers. Toon Swap decentralized exchange causes Toon Finance Tokens to soar Toon Swap is the answer to the inherent vulnerabilities of centralized exchanges that has proven time and again that its current place in the hearts of crypto investors is undeserved.\u00a0 Centralized exchanges encourage theft by allowing self-regulation when it comes to the aspect of liquidity. Centralized exchanges like Binance and FTX would rather use their users\u2019 funds that actually leave it alone. Due to the collapse of FTX, Toon Finance had a surge of interest similar to Trust Wallet who got it\u2019s all time high after FTX stole their users\u2019 money. Toon Swap is in the eye of multitudes of investors and it\u2019s all because of Space Battlegrounds. Space Battlegrounds will allow Toon Swap users to bet on the results of play to earn p2e games. This encourages large volumes of token movement in the exchange causing people to trade here more often as there will always be a buyer here. Disclaimer: This is a press release post.

Additionally, finding a currency with growth potential requires much effort considering the everyday debut of currencies. However, a novice presently has the cryptocurrency limelight. And Flasko is that coin. Flasko has drawn interest from investors in known cryptocurrencies like The Graph (GRT) and Aave (AAVE). The Graph (GRT): Not A Good Long-Term Investment Yaniv Tal created a protocol called The Graph (GRT) to make it easier for users to search for and analyze information from the blockchain. Although useful, many individuals find The Graph (GRT) very complex and don\u2019t want to take the time to grasp the minute nuances. As a result, The Graph (GRT) \u2018s attraction to the public is constrained. The Graph (GRT) won\u2019t have long-term improvements due to this. And with a current price of $0.06469, a 23.73% fall from just a month ago, The Graph (GRT) is not a good investment option.\u00a0 Aave (AAVE) Sees A Downward Swing With Aave (AAVE), investors contribute funds to the market in exchange for earnings, while borrowers can borrow with excessive or insufficient assets. This use case helped Aave (AAVE) reach its peak of $638 in 2021. Unfortunately, it has all gone down for Aave (AAVE) since then.\u00a0 Aave (AAVE) is currently worth $64.92, a dramatic 89% decrease from its peak. Experts are pessimistic about Aave (AAVE), stating that it would inevitably fade away in the unstable cryptocurrency market. Flasko (FLSK) May Top The Charts In 2023 Flasko seeks to merge the NFT sector with the wine, champagne, and whiskey industry. Both industries have been growing unprecedentedly, offering 28% yearly returns. Lovers of digital currencies can purchase fractionalized NFTs secured by rare wines, classic champagne, and deluxe whiskey with the aid of this project. With a complete NFT purchase, some investors may even get the asset delivered to an address of their choosing! Flasko will collaborate with luxurious beverage start-ups to help them reach a new audience while providing early investors with discounts and first access to brand-new products! The Flasko team will be locking team tokens for three years with a three-year vesting period to follow and freeze the token liquidity for 33 years! These measures make a very safe investment. Not to mention that Solid Proof has completed its audit of Flasko. With a price of just $0.099, now is the right time to buy into a future top 10 coin! As most crypto experts predict a $4 price point in June 2023, investing now will bring you a great profit! Disclaimer: This is a press release post.

On Tuesday, the court in charge of Celsius\u2019 bankruptcy case approved an extension on the lender\u2019s exclusivity period until 2023. The exclusivity period represents the time when the lender has the court-backed right to file a reorganization plan, in accordance with Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings.\u00a0 According to the court extension, the troubled lender has until February 15, 2023.\u00a0 Celsius participated in two hearings today and continued to advance the dialogue on key matters with important stakeholders in our cases.\u2014 Celsius (@CelsiusNetwork) December 6, 2022 The crypto company tweeted informing users of plans to leverage the extension toward finding liquidity and making customers whole again. Tuesday\u2019s announcement tweet said the company intended to \u201cexplore all value-maximizing opportunities\u201d for the benefit of customers and creditors.\u00a0 Furthermore, the lender disclosed another motion filed in court in a bid to tackle liquidity constraints. A decision from the court was expected next week at press time.\u00a0 This morning, we discussed our motion requesting approval to permit the sale of stablecoin, aimed at providing liquidity for our continued operations as we work to maximize value for all stakeholders. The Judge has indicated that he will share his decision soon, likely next week. Celsius Filed For Bankruptcy The once-premium crypto lender filed for bankruptcy after Terra imploded and shaved off over $40 billion from the markets. In the following weeks and months, so-called centralized entities like Celsius, BlockFi, Three Arrows Capital, and Voyager Digital all fell into ruin. Following the chapter 11 filing, CEO Alex Mashinsky resigned in September amid rumors of malpractice at the company. An early October court filing revealed 14,000 pages of Celsius user transaction history, including Mashinsky\u2019s trades as well as other top-ranking executives.\u00a0 The filing showed that Mashinsky, CTO Nuke Goldstein, and former CSO Daniel Leon all withdrew millions from the company\u2019s custody accounts sometime between May and June 2022, around the time of Terra\u2019s failure. Ex-CEO Alex Mashinsky CTO Nuke Goldstein Ex-CSO Daniel Leon Galaxy Digital Eyes Celsius Assets The crypto lender auctioned off assets following chapter 11 bankruptcy. One of the company\u2019s assets, a crypto custodian called GK8, caught the eye of Mike Novogratz\u2019s Galaxy Digital. The crypto-focused company reportedly won the bid for the asset and will help GK8 to build crypto trading facilities for institutional investors",

Meanwhile, a rejection from here may land the popular altcoin within a firm bearish influence, but a rebound is expected to be underway. In a recent tweet, the IOHK stated that more than 100 projects have been launched on the Cardano blockchain over the past week. Moreover, the number of projects in development also witnessed significant growth at the same time. This consistent rise in the network led to a massive rise in the development activity which clearly indicates that the Cardano team had grown significantly over the period as a rise in development has led to a notable surge in the ADA price. Along with the rise in development activity, the Cardano blockchain also performed well in the NFT market. In the past week, the volume of the NFTs sold over the network rose by 6.44% as per the data procured from opencnft. Woefully despite the rise, the sales on the Cardano network slumped by nearly 9% in the same time frame. Further, in DeFi, Cardano\u2019s Total Value Locked (TVL) displayed significant improvements over time. The TVL raised by more than 10,000% in the past 12 months, while the present rise accounts for $61.62 million with a rise of more than 2.15% in the past 24 hours. Woefully, the revenue generated by Cardano continued to tank down as it plummeted by more than 25% in the past month.\u00a0 Besides, the volume over the Cardano chain also plummeted heavily from over $898 million to as low as $182 million over the last month. The daily active address also witnessed a major drop at the same time. Overall the Cardano (ADA) price is trading at $0.3166 with a drop of over 3.12% in the past 24 hours.",

She also starred in the 1980 film about student life at New York\u2019s High School of Performing Arts, where Cara played the lead role of Coco Hernandez alongside Debbie Allen, Anne Meara, Judd Nelson, and Barry Miller. Her performance on the soundtrack led to a Grammy nomination for Best New Artist and Best Pop Performance of the film\u2019s title song, \u201cFame.\u201d</p> <p>Three years after <em>Fame</em>, Cara was tapped to sing the theme song from the 1983 film <em>Flashdance</em>, starring Jennifer Beals. Cara won an Academy Award for Best Original Song for \u201cFlashdance\u2026What A Feeling,\u201d along with songwriters Giorgio Moroder and Keith Forsey. The song also won two Grammy awards.

    "content": "Wednesday's special episode of The Masked Singer will pay tribute to Kirstie Alley, who died at age 71 on December 5th after a private battle with colon cancer. The Cheers and Look Who's Talking actress made her final television appearance on Fox's reality singing competition earlier this year, participating in Season 7, The Masked Singer: The Good, The Bad, and The Cuddly. In Season 7 Episode 8, which aired on April 27th, Alley performed \"The Shoop Shoop Song (It's in His Kiss)\" by Cher and \"Me Too\" by Meghan Trainor before she was eliminated and unmasked as Team Cuddly's Baby Mammoth mascot. Following the November 30th Masked Singer Season 8 finale, the series will air its Masked Singer Seasonal Sing-A-Long Spectacular! in its usual timeslot on Wednesday, December 7th, at 9 p.m. on FOX. The recently announced special will now include a card paying tribute to Alley, according to Deadline. The November 9th episode of The Masked Singer Season 8 similarly aired a 30-second tribute video and card dedicated to the memory of Soft Serve performer and guest panelist Leslie Jordan, who died in October. \"I came on Masked Singer because about 10 years ago, I realized I always had to keep mixing my career, mixing my life up, or it was going to get really mundane. It was going to get really boring, fast,\" the Golden Globe and two-time Emmy-winning Alley said in a post-elimination interview that aired after her Baby Mammoth unmasking. \"I guess I finally got up the nerve to do it.\" Below, watch what is believed to be Alley's final TV interview. Alley's family confirmed her death in a post published to her social media on Monday, saying in a statement, \"We are sad to inform you that our incredible, fierce and loving mother has passed away after a battle with cancer, only recently discovered.\" {replyCount}commentsThe statement continued, \"She was surrounded by her closest family and fought with great strength, leaving us with a certainty of her never-ending joy of living and whatever adventures lie ahead. As iconic as she was on screen, she was an even more amazing mother and grandmother. We are grateful to the incredible team of doctors and nurses at the Moffitt Cancer Center for their care. Our mother's zest and passion for life, her children, grandchildren and her many animals, not to mention her eternal joy of creating, were unparalleled and leave us inspired to live life to the fullest just as she did. We thank you for your love and prayers and ask that you respect our privacy at this difficult time.\"John Travolta, who starred with Alley in the 1993 comedy Look Who's Talking and its two sequels, paid tribute to his co-star with a post on Instagram, remembering Alley as \"one of the most special relationships I've ever had.\" More of Alley's co-stars -- including cast members of Cheers and Scream Queens -- took to social media to mourn the actress.",

As part of a promotion to celebrate the 10th anniversary of The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, the rental app has announced that the original Hobbiton film set, as seen in The Lord of the Rings trilogy and The Hobbit film franchise, will be available to rent. There's a catch though, this isn't a contest and will require you to not only be in New Zealand to take part in your stay, plus you'll need to beat out the other Tolkien fans that are trying to book a vacation too. The good news however is that the cost for a two-night say is just $6 a night!Booking for the property will open at 10 AM New Zealand time (4 PM ET), with just three sets of dates available for booking including: March 2-4, March 9-11, and March 16-18. In addition to an overnight stay in \"The Millhouse,\" a two-bedroom Hobbit-inspired home, attendees will have special access to 44 permanently constructed Hobbit Holes and other beloved locations in The Shire.

In addition to the show being set a few hundred years before the events of The Lord of the Rings, meaning The Shire and Hobbits aren't technically a thing, it's being produced by entirely different studios.Earlier this year it was reported that the film and gaming rights to The Lord of the Rings franchise would be going up for auction, something that Warner Bros. disputed at the time. Months later however it was announced that Embracer Group had acquired the rights to the IPs for The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit, and claim to own worldwide rights to motion pictures. Warner Bros. and New Line Cinema have an animated movie set in Middle-earth that is scheduled for release in 2024, The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim.",

    "content": "Para Nick Carter, enterarse de que su hermano menor, Aaron, hab\u00eda fallecido, fue un golpe muy fuerte. A pesar de la distancia que lleg\u00f3 a haber entre ellos, el amor fraternal fue un lazo que jam\u00e1s se rompi\u00f3.

In addition, as revealed by the Terra Rebels, the requirement to have the Terra Classic chain supported on Interchain Station involves an uphill task that has yet to be attempted. Notably, TFL required the Terra Classic network to change its wallet prefix, which it shares with LUNAv2, and carry out other chain upgrades before December 15. However, all of these will take at least six months, as disclosed by the Terra Rebels. Consequently, the Terra Rebels proposed a transition to the Rebel Station until the network decides to carry out these upgrades, allowing users to interact with their tokens and continue governance and delegation as usual.

    "content": "The depths of a bear market may not be the best time to raise funds but that is exactly what Blockstream is doing. The crypto infrastructure firm is seeking fresh funding, but at a much lower valuation than previous rounds, according to a Dec. 7 Bloomberg report. Blockstream was valued at $3.2 billion when it held its last Series B funding round raising $210 million in August 2021. Today that valuation may have fallen almost 70% to below $1 billion according to the report . The company, founded in 2014, has raised a total of $299 million in funding over four rounds, according to CrunchBase . Blockstream CEO and cryptographer Adam Back did not share details of the latest funding round but did reveal that the capital will be invested into expanding the firm\u2019s mining capacity. The firm is working with Jack Dorsey\u2019s Block (formerly Square) to develop a solar-powered Bitcoin mining facility . The mining farm will have 3.8 megawatts (MW) of electrical capacity using Tesla\u2019s solar technology and its Lithium-ion 12 MWh \u2018Megapack\u2019, as reported by Cointelegraph in April. Back acknowledged that BTC prices and mining profi tability were down but added \u201chosting rates have risen over the last quarters and our mining services are a rapidly expanding, high-margin enterprise business for us.\u201d Bitcoin miners are currently suffering a triple whammy of high hash rates and difficulty, high energy prices, and low BTC prices. This has caused profitability, or hash price, to fall to near-record lows of around $0.064 per TH/s per day, according to Hashrate Index . Related: Blockstream CEO Adam Back talks Bitcoin over a game of Jenga In its monthly newsletter on Dec. 5, Blockstream revealed that its Blockstream Mining Note (BMN) token has earned around 5.37 BTC cumulatively in returns nearly halfway into its three-year term.

    "content": "Experts in the cryptocurrency industry have predicted that Flasko will be a popular crypto in your portfolio in 2023. Forecasts suggest that by 2023, Flasko will have outperformed even more prominent cryptocurrencies like Fantom (FTM) and Aave (AAVE). Fantom (FTM) is another unsuccessful coin in 2022, among many famous ones. This blockchain serves as a decentralized software and digital asset platform with open-source contracts. But Fantom (FTM) is having difficulty gaining stability in the crypto market. Since June of this year, the value of Fantom (FTM) has been steadily declining. For the same reason, investors prefer Flasko investments over those in the failed Fantom (FTM) coin. Due to its explosive popularity on social media, Aave (AAVE) has attracted heavy investment. It hasn\u2019t recovered from an intraday low of $64.70 to close at $63.56 today. This means that with a total value locked (TVL) of $5.27 billion, Aave (AAVE) is the fourth most valuable decentralized finance (DeFi) technology. However, experts remained cautious towards the DeFi currency, stating that it might ultimately lose pace amid the shifting crypto market. The current valuation of Aave (AAVE) on the market is $1.05 billion, down 75.00% from a year ago. This is why Aave (AAVE), much like Fantom (FTM) investors, are eyeing Flasko, a seemingly more profitable coin. Despite being an upcoming project in the cryptocurrency market, Flasko is believed to have the potential to become a cryptocurrency leader. Flasko is an upcoming platform where users may invest in fractionalized NFTs backed by real-world rare, costly, and vintage whiskey, wine, and champagne bottles. By backing the NFTs with these real-time luxury drinks, Flasko provides investment options for crypto aficionados and wine collectors. Investors are racing to get in on the Flasko presale because of the high hopes that it would outperform more established cryptocurrencies. Top crypto experts anticipate that Flasko (FLSK) will climb by over 4,000% by March 2023 consequently establishing its spot among the fastest-growing cryptos of 2023. With a current price of only $0.099, this is a perfect opportunity to purchase Flasko presale tokens.",

    "description": "Iran\u2019s plan to freeze bank accounts reinforces the need for decentralized currencies to exist in tandem with cash and CBDCs.",
    "content": "A member of the Iranian parliament has told local media the government plans to impose new punishments on women who do not wear a hijab in public, with individuals who refuse to comply after two warnings possibly having their bank accounts frozen. Hossein Jalali, a member of the Cultural Commission of the Islamic Consultative Assembly, told Iranian media on Dec. 6 that \u201cunveiled persons\u201d would be sent an SMS urging them to respect the law and wear a hijab before entering a \u201cwarning phase\u201d and finally having their bank account potentially frozen. Similar actions taken by governments in the past have seen protestors and dissidents turn to cryptocurrencies to continue accessing financial instruments. Jalali did not detail what the \u201cwarning stage\u201d entailed, he suggested there should not be \u201cmorality police\" enforcing compliance with the law and other key figures have noted cameras may be used in combination with artificial intelligence to identify offenders. Ongoing protests have occurred in Iran since Sep. 17, when an Iranian woman named Mahsa Amini was arrested by the morality police for not wearing a hijab and died in suspicious circumstances at a hospital in Tehran. Many women are now setting fire to their hijab or refusing to wear them amidst a broader push to force the government to back down on its compulsory hijab requirements. The threat to freeze the bank accounts of protestors parallels events in Canada earlier this year where the country's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau invoked the Emergencies Act on Feb. 15 enabling regulators to freeze the bank accounts of members partaking in the \"Freedom Convoy\" protests Some convoy protestors turned to crypto as a way to fund the movement after the fundraising platform GoFundMe removed the campaign from its website. Iran, which has been using crypto in international trade deals since Aug. 9, has been developing its own Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) called the crypto rial . Related: Kraken settles with US Treasury's OFAC for 'apparent' sanctions violations The threat from Iranian officials to freeze bank accounts to enforce compliance again highlights the risks of CBDCs and the transition to cashless economies . Nigeria on Dec. 6 banned ATM withdrawals of more than $45 a day in an attempt to force the population to use its unpopular CBDC. Transactions of decentralized cryptocurrencies by contrast are similar to cash in that they can not be censored by government officials. CBDC critic and host of the popular YouTube channel Wall Street Silver noted in a Dec. 6 tweet that governments having absolute power over your money is a scary idea. Sounds like another revolution in the making. Imagine a government having a CBDC and the ability to delete your money if you don\u2019t behave. pic.twitter.com/75ZN5hAZCr",

    "content": "India just started rolling out 5G networks after much anticipation and years-long delay. Service operators expect to bring next-generation cellular connectivity to every town in the world\u2019s second-largest wireless market by as early as the end of 2023. But while the rollout is currently at its initial phase, New Delhi last week directed telecom operators to not set up 5G infrastructure around areas close to airports to avoid interference with flight operations. The Department of Telecommunications (DoT), the government body that handles telecom operations in the South Asian nation, in its recent order to telecom operators Reliance Jio, Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea, directed them to restrict their infrastructure enabling C-Band 5G networks (between 3.3-3.67GHz) from over 1.3 miles (2.1 kilometers) away from runway endpoints at all airports in the country. It also ordered all three operators to limit the power emission of their equipment installed after the given range. The restrictions were enforced in response to concerns raised by the Indian Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA). In September, the aviation department suspected that 5G networks operating on the C-Band spectrum would interfere with flight altimeters \u2014 the instrument that helps pilots maintain the required altitude during flight. The airline industry in the U.S. raised similar concerns in January when AT&T and Verizon activated their C-Band 5G networks. In June, the Federal Aviation Administration said that stakeholders in aviation and wireless industries identified steps to protect commercial flights from disruption by 5G interference and permitted AT&T and Verizon to continue to enhance their service at certain airports with the least risk of disrupting flight schedules. Shortly after the network disruption concerns arose in the U.S., the Indian telecom minister Ashwini Vaishnaw in February assured the industry that the South Asian country would not face any such issues. \u201cIn the U.S., especially in older airplanes, the altimeter frequency is close to the one being used to render 5G services,\u201d he said in a press conference, adding that the frequency used by flight altimeters in India was far away from the frequencies designated for 5G services. P D Vaghela, chairman of the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India, made a similar statement in an interview with the English daily Times of India in January. \u201cIndia will have no problems. Prima facie, there are no problems for the aviation industry within India over 5G spectrum rollout,\u201d he had said. C-Band frequencies \u2014 a part of the mid-band spectrum \u2014 range between 4-8GHz. Telecom operators in the U.S. have the C-Band comprising a 3.7-3.98GHz frequency range, which is possible to intercept the altimeter range between 4.2-4.4GHz in some cases. However, the Indian government auctioned the mid-band spectrum in the 3.3-3.6GHz range. Peeyush Vaish, a partner and telecom sector leader at Deloitte, said that Indian operators have a distinct separation of 530MHz from the international altimeter band. There has been no reported interference between 5G and aircraft frequencies in Europe, South Korea and Japan \u2014 all of which have launched 5G services based on 5G bands similar to those assigned in India, he said. Nonetheless, due to the direction from the telecom department, telcos in the country are evaluating a series of steps, multiple sources aware of the development told TechCrunch. Airtel so far deployed its infrastructure to enable 5G connectivity at four airports in the country, while Jio also planned to make a similar move in the coming days. Due to the restrictions, Airtel and Jio need to re-evaluate their plans. The former also needs to switch off its radios for the time being. The DoT director general and the independent body for Indian telcos, the Cellular Operators Association of India, did not respond to requests for comment. Experts believe that consumers in the proximity of airports are not likely to get 5G on their compatible devices. The directive indicates that a user in Aerocity in New Delhi or one in Mumbai\u2019s Santacruz may not get 5G for now, a source working at a telecom operator who requested not to be named told TechCrunch. The impact would, however, be less in cities including Bengaluru, where airports are miles away from local residencies, they said. Vaish of Deloitte stated that while the current network infrastructure is not likely to be affected due to the restrictions, new tower construction near urban airports might be delayed for the time being. Even though the directions are limited to the specific C-Band network frequencies, the impact seems significant as telcos consider the particular band for widespread 5G connectivity across various devices. Amitoj Arya, a partner at EY, said that since the interference issue does not impact all airlines and is limited to a specific type of aircrafts, 5G can be rolled out in a phased manner while retrofitting affected aircrafts with interference-resistant altimeters. He also suggested that telcos could be directed to run 5G services around airports with reduced power levels and technology interventions on 5G antennas. \u201c5G has the potential to alleviate several of airports\u2019 and airlines\u2019 pain points, such as aircraft data analytics and predictive maintenance, autonomous apron operations, automated baggage handling, AI-based passenger monitoring and screening, etc. Hence, it is critical to identify ways to allow 5G technology near the airports while not compromising the safety and security of the passengers,\u201d he said. The DGCA is exploring the replacement of aircraft radio altimeter filters to overcome the roadblock for telcos. However, it would take months for all flights to get the upgraded systems. India\u2019s nationwide 5G rollout plan could hit turbulence due to aircraft interference concerns by Jagmeet Singh originally published on TechCrunch",

    "content": "The new policy is a win for advocates who have long warned of the dangers of foul balls. Andy Barron/RGJ/USA TODAY Sports Network Major League Baseball will require all of its affiliated minor league ballparks to have protective netting extended down each foul line by no later than the start of the 2025 season, the league and Senator Dick Durbin (D\u2013Ill.) announced in a statement Wednesday. The new policy is a victory for advocates who have long warned of the dangers of foul balls\u2014especially in the age of cell phone distraction\u2014though it does not affect major league ballparks.\u201cMinor League Baseball is an exciting option for families to spend time together and experience professional baseball in an up close and personal way,\u201d said MLB deputy commissioner Dan Halem in a statement. Referring to the affiliated clubs by their new designation since MLB\u2019s 2021 restructuring of the minors, the Professional Development League, he continued, \u201cBy taking this action, our PDL Clubs have underscored their commitment to ensuring the safety of fans remains a top priority.\u201dThe announcement comes after the MLB Player Development League Executive Board voted unanimously to pass the initiative earlier this week. Clubs will have access to a consultant who specializes in stadium architecture and protective netting to help them comply with the initiative, which according to the announcement requires netting from foul pole to foul pole \u201cunless the configuration of the ballpark makes such coverage unnecessary.\u201d There also will be a mandatory height for the netting behind home plate that runs to the end of the dugouts.\u201cI'm just gratified that finally after seven years of pushing them to do the right thing, and after so many people have gotten hurt along the way, they finally have taken some steps to make these ballparks much safer,\u201d says Andy Zlotnick, a Manhattan real estate executive and lawyer who was hit in the face at Yankee Stadium in 2011. \u201cI'm thankful that the league figured it out.\u201dAn NBC News investigation from October 2019 found that more than 800 fans reported being injured by baseballs at MLB games from \u201912 to \u201919, though these figures do not include injuries at minor league parks.Zlotnick has been one of the most vocal fan safety advocates in the country. Over the last seven years, he has formed a coalition of fans who were injured at baseball games, and together, they have shared their stories and called on MLB to do more to protect them. In doing so, they swayed public opinion and caught the attention of Durbin, the Senate Democratic Whip, who leveraged his position as the second-highest ranking member in the chamber to put pressure on the league and push others to support additional netting at ballparks.SI Daily Cover: Crying Foul Over Ballpark InjuriesMLB and its teams in recent years have taken some measures to make their parks safer. At the 2019 winter meetings, commissioner Rob Manfred announced that all 30 MLB teams would extend the netting at their stadiums before the start of the next season, though there was little specificity for how far the netting had to go. As of August \u201921, only six big-league parks had fully extended netting, from foul pole to foul pole, while 22 parks had nets that extended to the elbows, the area where the side wall changes direction and angles away from the field. The remaining two\u2014Great American Ballpark in Cincinnati and Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg, Fla.\u2014had extended it past the dugouts but short of the elbows. Still, fans attending MLB games were protected more than they ever had been before.The same could not be said for minor league ballparks. Previously, the decision to install netting was left to the individual minor league clubs, many of which lack resources to pay for adequate netting. It would cost approximately $120,000 to extend the netting 300 feet down both lines at a typical stadium, according to Nathaniel Grow, an associate professor of business law and ethics at Indiana University\u2019s Kelley School of Business who has written about fan safety at ballparks. Now, there is a uniform policy that all 120 affiliated minor league teams must follow, though it is still unclear how they will cover the costs. When asked, MLB declined to say who would pay for the netting at PDL parks.",

While Huobi Token (HT) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) have witnessed a rise in their price after going down for a long time, a new project, Orbeon Protocol (ORBN), has splashed the overall market with a mammoth pre-sale success. Huobi Token (HT) Lessens Monthly Loss Huobi is one of the largest crypto exchanges in the world by trading volume. Huobi Token (HT) runs the Huobi exchange.

Last week\u2019s growth of Huobi Token (HT) has managed to minimize the project\u2019s loss. The price of Huobi Token (HT) has seen a rise of 55% in the past week. Consequently, Huobi Token\u2019s (HT) monthly price performance has been able to cover some losses. Last month, Huobi Token\u2019s (HT) price fell by 24%.

    "content": "China\u2019s leading political party recognizes VeChain\u2019s potential for use in tracking carbon sustainability efforts in the beer industry. VeChain has been getting other commendations for its energy efficiency and could be poised for a price surge. The VeChain blockchain mission to provide sustainable carbon management solutions to a wide array of real-world industries has just been given a massive acknowledgment by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China for its role in revolutionizing the beer brewing industry. In a report shared on Twitter by popular VeChain influencer \u2018eisenreich\u2019 titled \u201cThe road to green transformation of the beer industry,\u201d the committee gave its opinion on how the local beer industry can completely, accurately, and comprehensively implement carbon neutralization before 2030. \"For the #lowcarbon transformation of the #beer brewing industry, VeChain's #sustainable carbon management solution can quantify the environmental protection behavior of each link in the production line and calculate the #carbon footprint of the product's entire life cycle.\" \ud83c\udf7a pic.twitter.com/JfXtIAJsA3 \u2014 eisenreich (@eisenreich) December 8, 2022 In the report, the committee noted that VeChain sustainable carbon management solution can quantify the environmental protection behavior of each stage of the beer production chain. The lightweight network can also calculate the carbon footprint of the entire life cycle of beer in great detail. The report stated. For the low-carbon transformation of the beer brewing industry, VeChain\u2019s sustainable carbon management solution can quantify the environmental protection behavior of each link in the production line, calculate the carbon footprint of the product\u2019s entire life cycle, and integrate the concept of \u2018green production\u2019 into the product, According to the committee, this will go a long way to complement efforts that brewers are already taking to make beer production in China environmentally friendly. Some of these efforts have been championed by breweries like Budweiser who have launched the first gas-powered and hence renewable energy brewery in the country. Following the lead of Budweiser, other beer giants like Snowflake, Tsingtao, and Yanjing have also started replacing their coal-powered boilers with gas-powered ones. In addition, the brewers have been working with both upstream and downstream partners including farmers, transporters, and distributors to make sure the entire industry reduces its carbon footprint amid the high demand for beer in the country. VeChain\u2019s sustainably increasing VET adoption This is not the first time sustainability is earning VeChain accolades. Previously, the blockchain received a nod from Alexandrs Pavlovics, a senior inspector at the Maritime Administration of Latvia, for being one of the distributed ledger networks that could revolutionize the maritime industry. VeChain was also commended by top Asian intergovernmental blockchain expert Andy Lian for using less energy than the Bitcoin network uses to mine 1 BTC. The growing acceptance of the network by sustainably enthusiasts could see VET the native token skyrocket to new price highs. At the time of writing, the token was trading at $0.018, up 0.11% in the last 24 hours.

The DLC includes 14 Castlevania weapons and items, including the Vampire Killer, Cross and Holy Water. They've all been reworked to fit in with the fast-paced combat of Dead Cells.The DLC includes two new biomes, including Dracula's Castle. You'll get to fight Death and Dracula as you make your way toward \"Dead Cells\u2019 most epic and ambitious boss battle yet,\" according to a press release. On top of all that, the soundtrack features 51 original Castlevania tracks.

There aren't many details of what's new at this stage, but it's safe to presume there will be plenty of visual splendor like in the PS5 release.Apart from its graphics, Returnal is best known for its merciless third-person action. You're not only going to face seemingly impossible odds, you're practically expected to die frequently (as you do in many roguelites). It's integral to the story \u2014 you play Selene, a woman stranded on an alien planet trying to find answers every time she comes back to life. While the difficulty is at times frustrating, the mechanics are solid enough that you might enjoy repeating an extra-challenging segment.With graphics that\u2019ll make your jaw drop, here is our 4th world premiere, coming to PC in 2023 this is Returnal! #TheGameAwardspic.twitter.com/Mb49WSULAo\u2014 The Game Awards (@thegameawards) December 9, 2022We'd expect some technical features to carry over from the PS5 edition, such as 4K ray-traced graphics and 3D audio. It's not clear if features like the DualSense-oriented haptic feedback will make the cut. However, there's little doubt that Returnal will shine on a sufficiently powerful PC.",

    "description": "You'll have to wait a while longer to give Street Fighter 6 a spin. Capcom revealed at The Game Awards that its modernized brawler will be available June 2nd, 2023 for PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X/S and PC (via Steam). Pre-orders are available now.The new title includes favorite series characters like Ryu and Chun-Li as well as relative newcomers like Luke, a DLC addition from Street Fighter 5 who's a \"key player\" in the expanding storyline. SF6 will add new modes like World Tour and Battle Hub, and promises to be more accessible to newcomers with a \"modern\" control mode. You can expect new mechanics like the Drive Gauge, and real-time commentary from experts in the fighting game scene to help explain what's happening in matches.Just announced, @StreetFighter 6 launches on June 2, 2023! Watch the trailer for more glimpses at World Tour and a first look at Dee Jay, Manon, Marisa, and JP.Pre-order now - https://t.co/XZhD5yNySipic.twitter.com/kqPJuCKX6a\u2014 The Game Awards (@thegameawards) December 9, 2022It's too soon to say if SF6 will please hardcore fighting game fans. However, it's clear that Capcom is eager to court players who've felt intimidated by the sometimes steep learning curve of fighting games. In theory, you'll enjoy yourself enough to stick around for the long term.",

    "content": "Starbucks Odyssey Web3-based rewards program built on Polygon has launched for beta testing. The launch pushes Polygon further into becoming one of the top choice blockchain networks for Web 3 adoption among mainstream brands. The partnership between Ethereum layer two scaling protocol, Polygon, and American multinational chain of coffeehouses, Starbucks, is finally coming to fruition. Polygon announced that the Starbucks Odyssey is now live on the protocol for beta testing by a limited number of waitlist members. The waitlist is also open for new participants to join the announcement added. Polygon and Starbucks first revealed their partnership back in September. The Starbucks Odyssey platform is billed to be a Web3-powered extension of the Starbucks Rewards loyalty program that unlocks access to exciting new benefits and experiences for members. On the beta currently, Starbucks Odyssey members can participate in a number of interactive activities called \u2018Journeys\u2019 to earn digital collectibles termed \u2018Journey Stamps\u2019 and bonus points that unlock these benefits. By early next year, members can alternatively also purchase \u2018limited-edition stamps\u2019 through a built-in marketplace within the Starbucks Odyssey web app experience according to Polygon. Meanwhile, all the digital collectibles feature artworks designed by Starbucks partners/employees that integrate visual elements of the company\u2019s past, present, and future. To unlock the benefits & experiences, members can immerse themselves in a series of interactive activities called \u2018Journeys\u2019 \ud83e\udd13 to earn digital collectible, \u2018Journey Stamps\u2019 & bonus points.\ud83e\uded8 Sip Sip, Hooray \ud83c\udf89 \u2014 Polygon \u2013 MATIC \ud83d\udc9c (@0xPolygon) December 8, 2022 The benefits that Starbucks has revealed to come with the experience range from; virtual espresso martini-making class or access to unique merchandise and artist collaborations, access to events hosted at Starbucks Reserve Roasteries, or even sponsored trips to the Starbucks Hacienda Alsacia coffee farm in Costa Rica. Polygon partnerships promoting MATIC adoption With the latest launch of the Starbucks Odyssey platform, Polygon is rapidly becoming one of the biggest on-ramps for traditional brands looking to deploy Web 3 and metaverse technology adoption strategies. Starbucks and other Polygon partners that include Reddit, Meta, Adobe, Stripe, and Nike have all cited the protocol\u2019s low transaction fees, high throughput, and environmental friendliness as their reasons for choosing Polygon. Polygon wrote about these strides, saying: \u201cStarbucks Odyssey members can enjoy a peace of mind knowing that their Web3 experiences are powered by one of the greenest blockchains in existence\u2026 The network\u2019s technical capabilities, a thriving ecosystem and the team\u2019s commitment to sustainability made Polygon a hub for some of the most important Web3 projects.\u201d The adoption Polygon is seeing has had a markedly positive impact on the price of its native currency MATIC. The crypto token closed Q3 of 2022 with 62.3 percent gains and is up another 18.9 percent so far in Q4. At the time of writing, MATIC was trading at around $0.92, up 3.27 percent in the last 24 hours. The underlying bullish narratives around the network could see the price of MATIC skyrocket when the crypto market returns to bull season.

    "content": "One of the top Shiba Inu influencers identified as ShibPP has disclosed that the metaverse was built on Unreal Engine 5.1. In July, Shiba Inu lead developer Shytoshi Kusama hinted on The Metaverse on Discord that the project would look \u201cUnreal\u201d without sharing additional details of how unreal the project will look. In the early hours of today, the metaverse team of Shiba Inu caught the participants of the Ryo Plaza Fireside chat by surprise after dropping the first official look of the WAGMI Temple instead of the expected first concept of Ryo Plaza. This is quite interesting as the first concept of the WAGMI Temple hub was shared in September. It was observed that three cities including Beijing\u2019s Temple of Heaven motivated the architectural design of the digital location. Within the space of three months, the team has been able to make a reality out of the concept. This beautiful design has been applauded by the SHIB community. Brandie Konopasek, an entertainment veteran, commented on the development. Official photo release of Wagmi! It\u2019s been incredible to bring this from concept to reality. These are direct pulls from the environment from within the Shib metaverse. One of the top Shiba Inu influencers identified as ShibPP has disclosed that the metaverse was built on Unreal Engine 5.1. Shiba Inu update on the entire ecosystem In July, Shiba Inu lead developer Shytoshi Kusama hinted on The Metaverse on Discord that the project would look \u201cUnreal\u201d without sharing additional details. After announcing a partnership with development studio The Third Floor, the team revealed its Unreal Engine experience. TTF\u2019s rapid prototyping, powered by real-time processing and creative iteration in Unreal Engine, will take ideas and looks from concepts into 3D prototypes. It is worth noting that Unreal Engine 5.1 is an iteration of the Unreal Engine. According to the developers, it was designed with an interesting feature set in UE5. This enables creators in different industries to work in a more versatile, efficient, and robust ecosystem. Recently, Shiba Inu developer \u201cShib trophias\u201d disclosed that version one of a project was being completed without further information on its name. He further disclosed that the project would be launched in phases to enable the content flow. The Shib community earlier thought the project was Shibarium, however, it turned out to be the entire ecosystem. The metaverse industry has been estimated to value at around $1.3 trillion by 2030. During the forecast period of 2022 to 2030, the registered CAGR (Growth Rate) is estimated to be around 44.5 percent. In 2021, the metaverse industry was valued at around $51.69 billion. This growth is expected to be driven by an increase in investment. The likes of Microsoft and NVIDIA have produced software and hardware to help power the metaverse. Around $70 billion was spent by Microsoft on metaverse-based interests. Shiba Inu is currently trading at $0.000009 with a 1.66 percent surge in the last 24 hours. From the current price, it does not look like Shib can hit $2 in the short term. However, there could be a mini-rally.

    "description": "If you missed out on securing a pre-order for Sony's PlayStation VR2 headset, you're in luck. The PlayStation Direct store no longer requires an invitation to place a PS VR2 pre-order.You won't necessarily have to wait for months to get your hands on the next-gen PS5 headset either, as The Verge points out. As things stand, Sony expects to deliver the device between its February 22nd launch date and February 28th.The initial wave of pre-orders required would-be PS VR2 owners to register their interest and hope they got an invitation from Sony. Now, you can reserve one and at least give yourself the option picking up the headset in February, especially given that it's unclear how much stock Sony will have at launch. You could always cancel a pre-order if you change your mind.You'll have to dig deep into your pocket to actually buy a PS VR2. The headset costs $550 and you'll need a PS5 to actually use the thing. Games from the original PS VR aren't compatible with the latest model either, so you'll need to build a fresh library of games or hope developers offer free PS VR2 upgrades. Polyarc just confirmed that it's bringing Moss and Moss: Book II to PS VR2, while Sony's positioning Guerrilla Games' Horizon Call of the Mountain, a Horizon Zero Dawn and Forbidden West VR spin-off, as the flagship launch title.",

    "content": "Magomed Ankalaev punching Anthony Smith at UFC 277 | Jerome Miron-USA TODAY Sports Dig into the main event of UFC 282, where former light heavyweight kingpin Jan Blachowicz will look to regain the vacant crown against the streaking Magomed Ankalaev. While the main event of UFC 282 was changed just a couple of weeks ago due to an injury to Jiri Prochazka, that doesn\u2019t mean the top of the card has taken a huge hit in terms of quality. I\u2019m not saying losing the always exciting Prochazka isn\u2019t going to have an impact on the entertainment factor; Prochazka has proven himself to be one of the more consistently dynamic fighters on the roster. But in terms of a pair of fighters looking to prove themselves worthy of being the best in their respective divisions? Well, if Proch\u00e1zka is going to be out for a while, there aren\u2019t many potential contests that fill that role better than Jan Blachowicz and Magomed Ankalaev. Unlike Prochazka, both men have proven they can turn in real snoozers. However, amidst those cures for insomnia, they also have several highlight reel KO\u2019s of their own. I wouldn\u2019t predict a barnburner in this fight to crown a new kingpin at 205, but I don\u2019t think there would be much shock to see a sudden and violent ending to the contest from either combatant. For the early prelims preview, click here. For the televised prelims, click here. For the rest of the main card, click here. For an audio preview, click here. Jan Blachowicz vs. Magomed Ankalaev, Light Heavyweight I don\u2019t know how many of y\u2019all can remember when Blachowicz was sitting at 2-4 in the UFC, but the list of people who believed he would ever claim UFC gold at that point was shorter than those who have walked on the moon. Now that the Pole has accomplished that feat, he\u2019s on the verge of becoming a two-time light heavyweight champion. Only Randy Couture and Jon Jones can make that claim. Not Tito Ortiz. Not Chuck Liddell. Not Daniel Cormier. Anyone else get the feeling we have underestimated this man? There are two reasons Blachowicz\u2019s UFC career got off to such a poor start: poor takedown defense and an inconsistent gas tank. Blachowicz addressed those issues well enough that no one questions his gas tank anymore and he recently had a stretch of five fights where his opponents were unable to take him down. Of course, Glover Teixeira was able to claim the light heavyweight title from him by taking him down, so it\u2019s safe to say he isn\u2019t impervious to being put on his back, but it isn\u2019t the surety to happen it once was. Regardless, it\u2019s hard to believe his number one goal won\u2019t be to keep Ankalaev from putting him on his back. The methodical Russian could very well be the best wrestler in the division. If that isn\u2019t the case, he\u2019s at least the most technically sound. It\u2019s easy to forget given Ankalaev spends most of his time engaging his opponent on the feet, but Ankalaev has been very particular with his game plans. If he feels like the most direct path to victory is taking care of business standing, he\u2019ll do that. However, against the likes of the dynamic Nikita Krylov, Ankalaev took the fight to the mat. If anything, an argument could be made Ankalaev doesn\u2019t take the fight to the mat enough. That isn\u2019t to say his fight IQ is questionable; far from it. However, given his best feature may be his top control and GnP, it\u2019s a bit of a surprise he doesn\u2019t look to take that route more often. Perhaps he has flashes of Paul Craig etched into his memory \u2013 his lone career loss was a triangle submission to the slick Scotsman \u2013 but there won\u2019t be any danger of Blachowicz attacking him from off his back. The battle on the feet is difficult to determine. Though neither is considered to be much for flash, power is not in short supply for either man. Ankalaev is the more dynamic of the two, offering the occasional head kick in addition to his tight boxing. Blachowicz tends to work all three levels with greater consistency, but Ankalaev has no issue working over whatever hole he can exploit. Unfortunately, there\u2019s a big key to this contest that has many worried it will be a terrible staring contest: both prefer to fight on the counter. Ankalaev\u2019s desire to get a read on his opponent ensures that he is going to have some real snoozers. He will occasionally attack aggressively, but only after he\u2019s made his reads within the course of the fight. Blachowicz has a more natural feel to fighting, no surprise given he\u2019s got nearly 40 fights underneath his belt. Teixeira proved he can be flustered if he\u2019s consistently taken down, which is why it feels like a surety Ankalaev will be looking for takedowns. However, there is one other factor that could put a wrench into that thought process: Thiago Santos proved a dynamic athlete and striker can put Blachowicz away. There\u2019s no doubt Ankalaev is the better athlete, especially now as Blachowicz is a few months away from his 40th birthday. If Ankalaev wants more than just the money that comes with being the champion, he could look to secure the title with a highlight reel KO. He could very well do that, but he would also be giving Blachowicz his best chance to secure his second title reign if that is the case. If I believed Ankalaev was more concerned about money than being champion, I might believe he\u2019d be willing to play with fire. Perhaps that could come down the road if Ankalaev has a long title reign, but he\u2019s never let being a boring fighter get in his way before. Now that he\u2019s so close to securing championship gold, I don\u2019t see him doing anything other than taking the most direct route. Perhaps being in the spotlight gets to him as he has never headlined a PPV before. Perhaps Blachowicz makes the perfect read and puts Ankalaev away. He\u2019s got the power to make that a distinct possibility, but the most likely outcome is Ankalaev playing it safe and taking the crown. Ankalaev via TKO of RD4",

    "description": "Chevrolet has inadvertently offered a peek at its first electrified Corvette. Fans on CorvetteBlogger, Corvette Forum and elsewhere discovered that GM briefly made the 2024 Corvette E-Ray hybrid available through Chevy's online visualizer tool. The design mates the wide body of the C8 Z06 with the regular model's exhaust pipes, and introduces minor cosmetic tweaks like new colors (Cacti green, anyone?) and model-specific wheels. The biggest changes, as you might guess, sit inside.Images of the engine bay suggest the E-Ray will use the regular C8 Corvette's LT2 V8 engine. As Jalopnikexplains, past reports have suggested this Vette will use an electric motor on the front axle to provide all-wheel drive. It might offer a combined 605HP. The absence of a charging port suggests this is a conventional hybrid rather than a plug-in, although a glimpse of the interior shows a button to control regenerative braking. You'd also see adaptive cruise control in the lineup for the first time.C8 Corvette E-Ray, a new hybrid version with an expected total of 605 combined hp (490 engine, 115 electric) expected to be released in the next few months.. thoughts? pic.twitter.com/8l4Wnxwgq3\u2014 Aaron (@aaron_g04xx) December 9, 2022The slip-up hasn't revealed much about options. A ZER Performance Package will add Michelin Pilot Sport 4S tires, underside strakes and possibly carbon-ceramic brakes. You'll have your choices of aluminum and carbon fiber wheels, at least.Chevy briefly confirmed the E-Ray's existence to CorvetteBlogger, noting in a statement that \"the holidays came early\" and asking enthusiasts to stay tuned. There's no mention of pricing, but the visualizer said the hybrid would arrive in summer 2023. The brand previously said to expect the semi-electric Corvette next year, but didn't narrow the timeframe.This is just the start of Chevy's plans to electrify its iconic sports car. A full Corvette EV is in development, and future hybrids are rumored to include the 800HP ZR1 in 2024 and 1,000HP Zora in 2025. Like it or not, the American status symbol won't be exclusively piston-powered for much longer \u2014 not that GM has much choice when numerous states plan to ban gas car sales by 2035.",

    "content": "Market analysts are optimistic that BTC could regain $19k price levels. Whale accumulation and on-chain activity point to the possibility of the BTC market entering a full-on reversal to new highs. The price of Bitcoin (BTC) has been holding strong in the $17,000 range, currently changing hands at around $17,200, up 2.60% in the last 24 hours. The price which is near its one-month high price of around $17,980, has sparked speculation that BTC could be on the road to regaining $19,000 price levels. One analyst that has expressed the view is pseudonymous crypto analyst \u2018CredibleCrypto.\u2019 The crypto market pundit noted that traders on Binance were showing up to support BTC price in the mid $16k range. He added that the price could drop one more time to around $16.4 to $16.5k and proceed from there to around $18-$19k. In a follow-up tweet in response to analyst OtsukimiCrypto, CredibleCrypto stated that while many observers expect the current rally to be a \u201cdead cat bounce,\u201d he expects that BTC will go on to enter a \u201cfull-on reversal to new highs\u201d and will soon surpass $30k. Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe, founder and CEO of trading firm Eight, seemed to share a similar stance, stating in a tweet that he is \u201cexpecting continuation for Bitcoin as long as we stay above $17K.\u201d He likened the overnight move to the BTC breakout from the end of November. Along with this, the surge in the price of BTC has also seen short traders in the derivatives market suffer massive liquidity. Per data from Coinglass, BTC futures market liquidations reached $36.77 million, with 88.33% of the figure contributed by short traders. Market commentator, OnChainCollege, pointed out that over $5 million of the BTC short liquidations happened during a 15 price upsurge. Related: Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) Keep Falling as Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) Becomes a Blue Chip Option in Presale What has been driving the BTC price surge? Meanwhile, crypto market analytics and social metrics monitoring platform, Santiment, has gone on to point out what has been driving the marginally sustained price surge. Santiment shared that due to accumulation, both BTC and Ether (ETH) are seeing their respective supplies on exchanges go lower. The two cryptocurrencies have now reached 4-year lows, implying lower sell-off risks. The percentage of all BTC held by exchanges has fallen to 6.32% while ETH fell to 12.06% of the circulating supply held by the trading venues. This is in contrast to the exchange supply of the leading dollar-pegged stablecoin Tether (USDT) which has spiked implying greater real-time buying power. \ud83e\uddd0 #Bitcoin and #Ethereum continue seeing their available respective supplies go lower & lower. They have now both breached 4-year lows, implying a lower sell-off risk. #Tether, meanwhile, has high exchange supply, implying greater real-time buying power. https://t.co/vbKVRG7WF0 pic.twitter.com/1xAICvUqva \u2014 Santiment (@santimentfeed) December 8, 2022 The BTC market first started showing strength following encouraging remarks made by Jerome Powell, the chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank, earlier this month. Powell noted that the Fed could possibly announce a lower-than-usual interest rate hike during its FOMC meeting later this month.

The main event here is Jan Blachowicz vs. Magomed Ankalaev for the vacant UFC light heavyweight title. That belt has just been vacated by the injured Jiri Prochazka (who was due to defend the belt against Glover Teixeira at this event). The co-main event for this one is the surging, and ever popular, Paddy Pimblett versus Jared Gordon. Also on the main card is Darren Till vs. Dricus Du Plessis, Santiago Ponzinibbio against Alex Morono (who is coming in for Robbie Lawler) and Bryce Mitchell versus Ilia Topuria. The prelims feature teenager Raul Rosas Jr. getting his proper UFC debut. He meets Jay Perrin. Past headliners Jairzinho Rozenstruik and Chris Daukaus will also fight on the prelims. There are early prelims for us tomorrow, too, headlined by Billy Quarantillo vs. Alexander Hernandez. Before these fights can happen, though, we gotta hit the scales.

The song is also commonly subtitled as \u201cChestnuts Roasting on an Open Fire,\u201d due to its opening lyrics. Multiple arrangements of the song have been recorded throughout the years, but the most notable version has to be Cole\u2019s, which includes the warm sounds of a small string section. The lyrics are filled with warm Christmas feelings and sweet holiday imagery, including: \u201cEverybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe/ Help to make the season bright\u2026Yuletide carols being sung by a choir/ And folks dressed up like Eskimos.\u201d The popular Christmas song has been covered by many artists, including Christina Aguilera for her 2000 album, My Kind of Christmas, and Michael Bubl\u00e9 on his Let it Snow EP. Check out the full lyrics below to get in the Christmas spirit.

    "content": "With the crypto market facing more obstacles than ever, it\u2019s hard to determine which crypto will be the next winner. Many investors look to tried and tested options such as Monero and Cardano, however with an annual decrease in value of 48.38% and 83.57% respectively, these investments aren\u2019t very appealing. As the year comes to a close, new options such as Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) are looking like much better alternatives, with proven gains of 655% even through the bear market. >>BUY ORBEON TOKENS HERE<< Orbeon Protocol Doubles In Price Amid Market Declines Orbeon Protocol is a new DeFi launchpad that lets retail investors buy shares in startups. They aim to level the playing field, as in the current investment lore, startups are only supposed to be accessible to venture capitalists. Through the Orbeon Protocol, startups can sell shares of their business equity in the form of NFTs fractionalized by the platform. These fractions allow retail investors to get in on the ground floor of a startup for as little as $1 a share. Orbeon Protocol keeps investors protected throughout the investment process with a security mechanism called \u201cFill or Kill\u201d. This mechanism automatically refunds an investor if the startup they\u2019ve invested in fails to meet its funding targets. The Orbeon team also pre-checks any startup looking for funds to ensure the highest quality businesses are on the launchpad. On top of an exciting new launchpad, the Orbeon Protocol ecosystem will also consist of: Given the turbulent nature of the DeFi market, Orbeon Protocol gives investors peace of mind by locking liquidity for ten years. All team tokens are also locked for 12 months and will be released quarterly from the 13th month. The Orbeon Protocol ecosystem will run on $ORBN, which automatically rewards holders. Holders are given exclusive access to investor groups, and receive discounts on trading fees, staking bonuses, voting rights, and early access to funding rounds. Out of ORBN\u2019s total supply of 888,000,000, 40% will be sold to the public during the presale. During stage one of this presale, the value of ORBN increased from $0.004 to $0.0144, with experts predicting a further increase to $0.24 by the end of the year. With plans for Orbeon Protocol to be integrated with popular exchanges, it\u2019s likely the value of ORBN will continue to surge as the year comes to an end, making it a great investment alternative to Monero and Cardano. Monero (XMR) Doubles Down On Crypto Anonymity Monero (XMR) is a peer-to-peer digital currency that focuses on anonymity. Transactions cant be traced to real-world identities, as each Monero is the same. This makes Monero hard to regulate, though very popular amongst crypto enthusiasts for this very reason. Over the past 12 months, Monero has decreased from over $250 to $132.78, losing 48.38% of its value. Despite this decrease, Monero has remained a popular investment option. Monero (XMR) has seen further issues with exchanges begin to delist the currency as the fight privacy coins. Cardano (ADA) Cardano (ADA) is a blockchain platform that uses a proof-of-stake algorithm to validate transactions. Cardano (ADA) has a large following and is the 8th biggest cryptocurrency on the planet. Despite currently being worth $0.3066, analysts suggest Cardano (ADA) price could rise to over $1, which would make Cardano (ADA) a strong investment as the year ends. Cardano (ADA) didn\u2019t feel the effects of FTX\u2019s collapse the same as the rest of the market as they had little to no exposure, making cardano a somewhat safe haven for investors looking to diversify their portfolio.

    "content": "WBTC is currently, without any doubt, one of the best cryptocurrency projects you can venture in as the year closes. From its previous seed round success, there is a high probability of sales to drive its presale. More than anyone could have anticipated, the WBTC network protocol launched its ICO after finishing the seed round. Interestingly, the WTC is at the beginning of a real boom once all the structures are in place. The WBTC Chain network is a decentralized scaling platform that provides developers with a safe and low-cost means of making user-friendly dApps. Due to the widespread skepticism in the bitcoin industry, each success seen by a cryptocurrency project is a cause for celebration. As with any complex project, it might be difficult for newcomers to appreciate the WBTC initiative. The most important thing is that WBTC is helping to bridge the gap between DeFi (decentralized financial) and the widespread use of crypto. The signs show that its value will rise significantly when listed on cryptocurrency exchanges. The first platforms to list the coin on their exchanges will be gate.io and KuCoin. The token will have a $1 listing price. The stage 2 initial coin offering, which is still active and has a fixed price of $0.1, is open to all investors. From your wallet, you can make purchases using or . Based on what has happened in the past, analysts think that investors will make a huge profit as the presale goes on. Investors can then use their wallets to claim their WBTC tokens. Join the second round of the ICO to protect your future with the $WBTC token and watch your investment grow over the next few days. The success of any team is based on the team. The WBTC network protocol is made up of a group of experts led by Nermin El Kadi, who is called the CEO.

    "description": "<p> According to Glassdoor (which collates salary data submitted anonymously), the average base salary for an <a href=\"https://www.financemagnates.com/tag/fx-trading/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"follow\">FX trader</a> in the UK in November 2022 was \u00a369,182 and additional cash compensation, including bonuses and commission, averaged \u00a386,851. The equivalent figures for an FX analyst were \u00a340,207 and \u00a34,102, respectively.</p><p>The most in-demand roles within the institutional space are sales professionals that have a genuine transferable book of clients, followed by trade support roles, such as solutions and operations, observed Reece Pawsey, the Director FinTop Consulting. \u201cWithin the retail space the greatest demand is for multilingual sales and business development professionals, which typically consists of retention and conversion,\u201d he said.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, there are insufficient numbers of candidates who meet the institutional profile, which has led to some brokers extending their search beyond individuals who bring business with them to those with experience but no transferable book of clients, or even more junior candidates. In the retail space, many candidates fit into either the retention or conversation category but lack the experience to generate new business.</p><p>According to Pawsey, brokers in the institutional space are now offering significantly higher base salaries than they were 12 months ago, unlike their retail counterparts, where salaries have remained largely the same. \u201cAs more new players enter the market it will become increasingly competitive with brokers competing for experienced candidates with a book of clients,\u201d he said. \u201cThat being said, the suitability of these clients also depends on the spreads, products and additional solutions offered by the broker.\u201d </p><p>Rebalancing of Roles </p><p>Michael Williams Associates has seen a consistent demand for both sales and trading roles explained the Managing Partner, Neil Price. \u201cFollowing the transition of selected staff from London to the EU in line with the post-Brexit regulatory requirement over the last two years, we are now seeing firms rebalance \u2013 essentially moving from the establishment of new desks to expansion and upgrading,\u201d he said.</p><p>The move towards digitisation of the FX business continues to drive the need for technical and quantitative experience, particularly in trading, which means that demand can outweigh the supply for specific skills, added Price.</p><p>In Cyprus, there is strong demand for MT4/MT5 administrators, experienced traders/dealers who are willing to work rotational shifts to cover all markets, and IT development profiles said Hayley Buckle, the Director of Recruitment at GRS Recruitment. </p><p>\u201cNot only is the supply of talent looking for work very limited \u2013 the needs of the individuals have changed,\u201d she explained. \u201cOver the past few years with the implementation of hybrid and remote working, more people are looking for positions that will allow them to work from home. With wellbeing at the top of most individuals\u2019 lists when job hunting, the benefits that companies offer have also changed to include gym memberships and on site massages, for example.\u201d</p><p>Georgia Michaelides, a Senior Recruiter at Emerald Zebra refers to an ongoing requirement for <a href=\"https://www.financemagnates.com/terms/c/compliance/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"569f58ee-534c-44f0-a7cd-f55b0f9a2b2a_1\" class=\"terms__main-term\">compliance</a>/AML, technology (specifically software development), business development and account management, <a href=\"https://www.financemagnates.com/terms/m/marketing/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"48d4594c-de24-47ac-9f1b-aa2e0da8374a_1\" class=\"terms__secondary-term\">marketing</a>, and dealer roles. </p><p>\u201cCompliance/AML candidates are particularly highly sought after,\u201d she said. \u201cGiven <a href=\"https://www.financemagnates.com/tag/cysec/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"follow\">CySEC\u2019s</a> stricter controls and fines, and what is happening in the financial world in general, companies are assessing their compliance programmes and enhancing them in order to meet regulatory guidelines.\u201d</p><p>Crypto Cannibalism?</p><p>As we have <a href=\"https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/top-talent-from-traditional-finance-is-shifting-to-crypto/\" target=\"_blank\">previously reported</a> high-profile figures have made the transition from FX to crypto in recent times, including the former Head of Electronic FX trading at Lloyds Bank.

    "content": "According to Glassdoor (which collates salary data submitted anonymously), the average base salary for an in the UK in November 2022 was \u00a369,182 and additional cash compensation, including bonuses and commission, averaged \u00a386,851. The equivalent figures for an FX analyst were \u00a340,207 and \u00a34,102, respectively. The most in-demand roles within the institutional space are sales professionals that have a genuine transferable book of clients, followed by trade support roles, such as solutions and operations, observed Reece Pawsey, the Director FinTop Consulting. \u201cWithin the retail space the greatest demand is for multilingual sales and business development professionals, which typically consists of retention and conversion,\u201d he said. Unsurprisingly, there are insufficient numbers of candidates who meet the institutional profile, which has led to some brokers extending their search beyond individuals who bring business with them to those with experience but no transferable book of clients, or even more junior candidates. In the retail space, many candidates fit into either the retention or conversation category but lack the experience to generate new business. According to Pawsey, brokers in the institutional space are now offering significantly higher base salaries than they were 12 months ago, unlike their retail counterparts, where salaries have remained largely the same. \u201cAs more new players enter the market it will become increasingly competitive with brokers competing for experienced candidates with a book of clients,\u201d he said. \u201cThat being said, the suitability of these clients also depends on the spreads, products and additional solutions offered by the broker.\u201d Michael Williams Associates has seen a consistent demand for both sales and trading roles explained the Managing Partner, Neil Price. \u201cFollowing the transition of selected staff from London to the EU in line with the post-Brexit regulatory requirement over the last two years, we are now seeing firms rebalance \u2013 essentially moving from the establishment of new desks to expansion and upgrading,\u201d he said. The move towards digitisation of the FX business continues to drive the need for technical and quantitative experience, particularly in trading, which means that demand can outweigh the supply for specific skills, added Price. In Cyprus, there is strong demand for MT4/MT5 administrators, experienced traders/dealers who are willing to work rotational shifts to cover all markets, and IT development profiles said Hayley Buckle, the Director of Recruitment at GRS Recruitment. \u201cNot only is the supply of talent looking for work very limited \u2013 the needs of the individuals have changed,\u201d she explained. \u201cOver the past few years with the implementation of hybrid and remote working, more people are looking for positions that will allow them to work from home. With wellbeing at the top of most individuals\u2019 lists when job hunting, the benefits that companies offer have also changed to include gym memberships and on site massages, for example.\u201d Georgia Michaelides, a Senior Recruiter at Emerald Zebra refers to an ongoing requirement for /AML, technology (specifically software development), business development and account management, , and dealer roles. \u201cCompliance/AML candidates are particularly highly sought after,\u201d she said. \u201cGiven stricter controls and fines, and what is happening in the financial world in general, companies are assessing their compliance programmes and enhancing them in order to meet regulatory guidelines.\u201d As we have high-profile figures have made the transition from FX to crypto in recent times, including the former Head of Electronic FX trading at Lloyds Bank. One of the was made earlier this year by the Managing Director and Global Head of FX prime brokerage at Jefferies and the investment bank\u2019s Global Head of FXPB distribution, who set up execution-only crypto ECN Crossover Markets. \u201cThe attractiveness of working at a crypto company gives them an edge when competing for candidates within the FX talent pool,\u201d said Donna Stephenson. \u201cWe have spoken to candidates that are actively seeking opportunities within the crypto space, from software engineers to executive directors that want to head up a CySEC licensed crypto asset service provider.\u201d Comparing average salaries and incentives for similar positions in FX and crypto is not easy.

Earlier this year, the Cypriot government introduced new tax incentive schemes, third-country work visas and spousal work visas to assist companies to attract candidates to relocate to Cyprus. Katerina Andreou, the CEO of HR Innovate, which sees the greatest demand for affiliate roles, sales and retention, observed that staff turnover makes the recruitment process even more challenging.

Yet, there are critical elements that impact the price of the coin. These include: All coins are impacted by supply and demand. Generally speaking, almost all new coins struggle with surplus supply due to a limitless supply of coins. D2T has a fixed supply of 1 billion coins for its customers and users.

    "content": "Authorities across the globe are fighting against time to bring justice to the millions of people impacted by the financial frauds committed by FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried . As part of the ongoing investigations, attorneys representing the Securities Commission of the Bahamas seek access to FTX\u2019s database with international customer information. The Bahamian attorneys filed an emergency motion with a Delaware bankruptcy judge requesting access to FTX\u2019s customer database to aid their ongoing investigations. The motion highlighted previous failed attempts to access the defunct crypto exchange\u2019s database. As a result, the lawyers claimed that FTX employees and counsel prevented authorities from getting critical financial information. The database in question is reportedly stored on Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud Portal databases, which include personal information such as wallet addresses, customer balances, deposit and withdrawal records, trades and accounting data. According to the lawyers, the U.S. bankruptcy proceedings will \"suffer no harm or hardship if this relief is granted.\" While AWS was used to store customer information, FTX used Google services as an analytics platform for data of users residing outside of the United States. According to the filing sourced by CNBC: The latest domino effect of FTX fraud was felt by media outlet The Block, which had failed to disclose funding from Alameda Research. The Block CEO Mike McCaffrey stepped down from his position after failing to disclose $27 million loans from FTX 's sister firm Alameda Research. Related: CZ and SBF duke it out on Twitter over failed FTX/Binance deal On Dec. 7, the new management team of FTX reportedly hired a team of financial forensic investigators to track down the missing customer funds exceeding $450 million in cryptocurrencies. As previously reported by Cointelegraph, the forensics firm is tasked with conducting \u201casset-tracing\u201d to identify and recover the missing digital assets and will complement the restructuring work being undertaken by FTX.",

    "content": "Dogecoin wicked above $0.10 in the middle of last week, leading crypto watchers to believe maybe an uptrend is on the way. All the speculations were thrown out of the window after the DOGE price dropped below its $0.10 support and back into the $0.09 zones. But the latest chart shows the memecoin getting close to the $0.10 mark \u2014 will DOGE be back to $0.12 by Christmas? performed in extremely volatile zones last week. As Elon Musk\u2019s decision to fire the ex-FBI General counselor in light of the suppression of the information about Biden Hunter\u2019s laptop went public, the DOGE community responded by rallying Dogecoin above the $0.10 mark to $0.11. Like always, however, the drop later was swift. But the community wasn\u2019t ready to give up on its rallying cry that easily, and the coin\u2019s value rose from $0.10 to $0.102. But that didn\u2019t last, as all it took was one red candle to push Dogecoin back below its $0.10 support. While there is some attempt to boost its value back, nothing of value is coming up so far. Dogecoin\u2019s intra-day hourly trading chart shows that the token performs in zones divided between volatility and stability. After the last long green, the DOGE price accumulated around $0.98, where the bulls and bears held equal ground. The bears soon overtook the market dropping Dogecoin\u2019s value to $0.096. The good news is all Dogecoin has to do create support at 0.786 fibs ($0.99) to retest the $1.10. But to return to $0.12 by Christmas, Dogecoin has to punch above the $0.11 mark, something that we can\u2019t see this token hitting in the next few hours. Dogecoin peaked at nearly $0.15 at the beginning of November, but the FTX-triggered crash pushed its value just above $0.070. The community tried to rally behind this token, but it was a vain effort since another pushback dropped DOGE\u2019s value further. However, Elon Musk\u2019s incessant comments about free speech on Twitter and some slight jabs at the \u201cmainstream\u201d media have continued to be the source of entertainment for people, and for the DOGE community, they are just another reason to rally the price. Does that mean the DOGE price will hit $0.12 by Christmas? Well, with the way things are going right now, anything can happen. That said, Dogecoin shouldn\u2019t be seen as anything more than a short-term investment. With no use cases associated and the disastrous level of dependence on Elon Musk\u2019s tweets, Dogecoin is not something that long-term holders would recommend. 2022 has seen two bear markets. And the second one almost led many on the verge of stopping trusting crypto altogether. The good news is amidst these turbulent times, utility-based cryptocurrencies have emerged that cater to the exact needs of the modern crypto space \u2013 offering use cases that can increase more people to adopt blockchain technology. Dash 2 Trade is a crypto intel platform designed to bring highly sophisticated market analytics tools to crypto traders of all levels.

Kavvathas declared that he would continue to serve as the MENA company's adviser.Since its founding in 2017, Amber has offered several services to institutional clients, including yield products and trading and liquidity services. With the launch of its wealth management platform, WhaleFin, it has lately entered the consumer market. Even though the financial reports weren't audited, the company reported a 25% revenue increase during the first half of this year compared with the previous year.According to Annabelle Huang, managing partner of Amber, \"Amber will continue to serve our global HNW [high net worth] and institutional clients. Asia has always been our key market because it is where our home base is and where we have the most resources.\"Headcounts in the Single Digits!Not only have these prominent employees left, but the bear market in cryptocurrency has been made worse by the failure of the cryptocurrency exchange FTX in November. According to a person acquainted with the company's operations, managers in Singapore began to announce in June that some overseas firms would be shutting down. As a result, Amber's U.S. and European offices now have a workforce in the single digits. The insider claimed that management didn't provide any justification for the choice.According to Huang, \"those deprioritized regions did experience considerable headcount losses. Europe headcount indeed declined from the high of 30 to 40 to single digits.\"In anticipation of weakening investment mood, \"we started scaling down in non-core regions, especially on the retail consumer side, since Q3,\" she continued. \"The FTX event, however, was unexpected, so we have decided to be more aggressive in scaling down those non-profitable efforts,\" the statement continued.Sports Sponsorships will EndAdditionally, the organization has been rearranging its sponsorships and international marketing goals.Amber had signed sponsorship agreements with Chelsea and Atletico Madrid, two soccer teams with annual values of around $44 million & $25 million, respectively. According to a source familiar with the corporation, the firm is attempting to renegotiate both obligations.According to a Friday Bloomberg article (2), Amber wants to end its contract with Chelsea. Amber choose not to respond.Job CutsIn September of this year, Amber began to reduce its workforce by 5% to 10%. Huang clarified that these reductions were a routine component of the company's quarterly business strategy. Huang said, \"We wanted to remain sensible and focus on the essential areas of the core operations.\" Therefore, we had to make some difficult decisions, which was regrettable.Bloomberg stated (3) that job losses have continued this week despite anticipation that they would be finished in November.According to business requirements and other operational factors, Huang added, \"We modify headcounts and team compositions.\" Quarterly, however, we typically examine our internal structure and team makeup.Huang estimated that Amber's population peaked at 1,100. According to a story published by Bloomberg on Friday, that number has now decreased to about 400.Amber's issues were made worse when Tiantian Kullander, also known as T.T., one of the company's co-founders, passed away in his sleep on November 23 at the age of 30. Additionally, it owes (4) Darshan Bathija, the CEO of the problematic cryptocurrency lender Vauld, around $130 million.",

    "content": "Orbeon Protocol\u2019s successful presale phase has caused a huge influx of buyers, resulting in the platform\u2019s website crashing. Orbeon Protocol is out to revolutionize and change the way investors think of venture capital forever. The high demand for Orbeon Protocol\u2019s native token, ORBN, has caused its value to increase by 655%, from $0.004 to $0.302. Orbeon Protocol recently entered its third presale phase after investors rushed for the token and bought out the second phase. BUY ORBEON TOKENS HERE Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) is a decentralized launchpad and investing platform disrupting the crowdfunding industry by connecting investors with promising startups. Orbeon Protocol does this by allowing people to invest in fractionalized NFTs based on equity. Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) offers a more transparent and efficient fundraising process. These equity-backed NFTs can be sold for as little as $1 by startups that need money. For the average investor, finding new and promising startups to invest in can be a challenge. Traditional venture capital funding is often reserved for large firms and high-net-worth individuals, leaving the average investor out of the loop. Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) changes this by allowing anyone to invest in fractionalized NFTs based on equity, giving investors more options and freedom in their investments. ORBN is the native token of the Orbeon Protocol, which makes the Orbeon ecosystem work. By staking their ORBN tokens, owners can earn a passive income, vote on new projects and important decisions, get access to upcoming funding rounds, and even join exclusive investor groups like the Winner\u2019s Circle. To ensure the ecosystem\u2019s and investor\u2019s security, Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) has implemented a \u201cFill or Kill\u201d mechanism, which refunds investors money if a project doesn\u2019t reach its funding goal. The ecosystem also includes several useful features, such as the Orbeon Wallet, Orbeon Swap, and Orbeon Exchange, which offer users a convenient and secure way to buy, sell, and trade cryptocurrencies and NFTs. The interest in ORBNs presale was so massive that investors managed to crash the Orbeon Protocol\u2019s website. The price went from a low of $0.004 to a high of $0.0302. A massive 655% increase . Analysts expect ORBN to grow by more than 6000% during its presale.

    "content": "Ripple vs SEC is one of the most talked stories within the crypto space which appear to be approaching its destiny. Hence the investor\u2019s interest is also swelling as they are constantly accumulating a huge number of tokens in recent times. This indicates that the majority of investors continue to believe in the potential of XRP, despite the SEC\u2019s lawsuit against Ripple. As the SEC believes the crypto XRP is a security and hence Ripple has been selling it illegally all over the years. Soon after a formal lawsuit was imposed, some of the US-based crypto exchanges delisted XRP, and many of the investors took XRP out of their portfolios, which negatively impacted the entire crypto space, including . However, the summary judgement of the lawsuit is yet to be produced which has been dragged on for more than 20 months now! In the meantime, the big investors are accumulating XRP and adding up in their wallets. Firstly, the investors may be having a perception of Ripple winning the case against the SEC as the advancements in the case point towards the company being victorious. Moreover, Hinman\u2019s documents which were largely discussed are said to be responsible for the beginning of the case against Ripple. In addition, Ripple\u2019s general counsel also hinted at lawsuit and also suggested that the in its own web soon. In a recent update, both parties have filed their respective amicus briefs and are requesting Judge Torress set a deadline of January 4, 2023, for the . Secondly, many countries are now focusing more on central bank digital currency (CBDC), and XRP will be a major highlight in this area. However, Ripple\u2019s main focus has always been working with the government and maintaining the integrity of the company\u2019s technology.",

Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView followed BTC/USD as it traded sideways after the close of trading on Wall Street.

    "content": "(To receive weekly emails of conversations with the world\u2019s top CEOs and business decisionmakers, click here.) During the early years of the Cold War, an array of underwater microphones monitoring for sounds of Russian submarines captured something otherworldly in the depths of the North Atlantic. The haunting sounds came not from enemy craft, nor aliens, but humpback whales, a species that, at the time, humans had hunted almost to the brink of extinction. Years later, when environmentalist Roger Payne obtained the recordings from U.S. Navy storage and listened to them, he was deeply moved. The whale songs seemed to reveal majestic creatures that could communicate with one another in complex ways. If only the world could hear these sounds, Payne reasoned, the humpback whale might just be saved from extinction. [time-brightcove not-tgx=\u201dtrue\u201d] When Payne released the recordings in 1970 as the album Songs of the Humpback Whale, he was proved right. The album went multi-platinum. It was played at the U.N. general assembly, and it inspired Congress to pass the 1973 endangered species act. By 1986, commercial whaling was banned under international law. Global humpback whale populations have risen from a low of around 5,000 individuals in the 1960s to 135,000 today. For Aza Raskin, the story is a sign of just how much can change when humanity experiences a moment of connection with the natural world. \u201cIt\u2019s this powerful moment that can wake us up and power a movement,\u201d Raskin tells TIME. Raskin\u2019s focus on animals comes from a very human place. A former Silicon Valley wunderkind himself, in 2006 he was first to invent the infinite scroll, the feature that became a mainstay of so many social media apps. He founded a streaming startup called Songza that was eventually acquired by Google. But Raskin gradually soured on the industry after realizing that technology, which had such capacity to influence human behavior for the better, was mostly being leveraged to keep people addicted to their devices and spending money on unnecessary products. In 2018, he co-founded the Center for Humane Technology with his friend and former Google engineer Tristan Harris, as part of an effort to ensure tech companies were shaped to benefit humanity, rather than the other way around. He is perhaps best known for, alongside scholar Ren\u00e9e DiResta, coining the phrase \u201cfreedom of speech is not freedom of reach.\u201d The phrase became a helpful way for responsible technologists, lawmakers and political commentators to distinguish between the constitutional freedom for users to say whatever they like, and the privilege of having it amplified by social media megaphones. Raskin is talking about whale song because he is also the co-founder and President of the Earth Species Project, an artificial intelligence (AI) nonprofit that is attempting to decode the speech of animals \u2014from humpback whales, to great apes, to crows. The jury is out on whether it would ever truly be possible to accurately \u201ctranslate\u201d animal communication into anything resembling human language. Meaning is socially constructed, and animal societies are very different to ours. But Raskin is optimistic that the attempt is worthwhile, given that connection with animals can be a force strong enough to galvanize humans into protecting the natural world at such a critical juncture in the fight against climate change. The Earth Species Project is applying natural language processing\u2014the AI technique behind human translation software and chatbots like OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT\u2014to recordings of animals. While they haven\u2019t succeeded in \u201cdecoding\u201d any animal speech yet, computer scientists at the nonprofit recently designed an algorithm that is able to isolate the sounds from a single individual animal (the algorithm works well on bats and dolphins, and is not bad at elephants,) in a recording of multiple \u201cspeakers.\u201d Raskin says solving this issue\u2014known as the \u201ccocktail party problem\u201d since it is comparable with the difficulty of focusing on one person speaking in a crowded room\u2014is a first step toward decoding the mysteries of the animal kingdom. Read More: AI Chatbots Are Getting Better. But an Interview With ChatGPT Reveals Their Limits Although fixing the ills of social media and decoding animal speech may seem worlds apart, Raskin sees them as part of a holistic mission. The Earth Species Project and the Center for Humane Technology are both \u201cexperiments into how you shift trillion dollar industries,\u201d Raskin says. They share the same goal: changing society for the better, not through the traditional Silicon Valley route of building an app or cornering a business model, but by changing culture. TIME spoke with Raskin this summer. In this wide-ranging conversation, we discuss not just animal translation, but the state of social media, applying those lessons to the rapid rise of artificial intelligence, and how\u2014amid everything\u2014to secure a place for both humanity and nature in a fast-changing world. This interview has been condensed and edited for clarity. Before we get onto talking about the Earth Species Project, I want to talk about your life up to now. Your father was Jef Raskin, the famous expert in human-computer interaction at Apple who left a huge mark on that company. You yourself were a Silicon Valley founder who worked on subtly changing people\u2019s behaviors through technology. Then you gave that all up to sound the alarm on social media. Now you\u2019re trying to talk to animals through AI. Talk me through your trajectory. My mother worked in a palliative care hospice. From her, I learned what it is like to care for someone with dignity. My father created the Macintosh project at Apple. And he also came with a very humanistic sense of care, at a moment in Silicon Valley before it had been captured by engagement and the attention industrial machine. You could still ask these questions: what is technology even for? One of the things that makes humanity unique is not that we use tools\u2014lots of species use tools\u2014but the extent to which our tools remake us. There is no such thing as to be human without using some form of technology. Whether that\u2019s language, whether that\u2019s fire, or anything that came after. One of the things that people miss is the extent to which our technology changes our social structures and our culture. Just look at the plough. It changed how we lived, it created surplus food that let us move into cities, which changed the nature of family and relationships. If you\u2019re going to use animals to plough your field, it\u2019s not compatible with animistic traditions anymore, so it changes religion. Growing up, especially with my father, I was given this lens of how fundamental technology is to what humans become. We have a choice about what we do with technology, and what\u2019s at stake is our identity and how we interrelate with the rest of the world. My father was really interested in the idea of ergonomics: how human beings bend and fold. If you don\u2019t understand and study ergonomics, you end up designing things like chairs that really hurt us. There\u2019s also an ergonomics of relationships, of communities, of societies\u2014a way that we bend and fold. If we\u2019re blind to ergonomics, we break ourselves. If capitalism isn\u2019t ergonomic to our biosphere, we break the container that we live in. And this is the through-line. For almost all my work, I ask: how do we create things that understand the ergonomics of how we as human beings work, how our biosphere works, how our technosphere works, so that we can create things that help us thrive as a whole? You\u2019ve done a lot of work around making technology more humane. But decoding animal speech seems out of left-field. How are the two connected? Civilization can\u2019t exist without the accumulated culture and knowledge that comes from language. It\u2019s right there at the core of human identity. The more you look, the more you realize human identities tied up with language, and that tells you that there\u2019s something really important there for us to examine. Because even if we\u2019re able to draw down all the carbon from the atmosphere tomorrow, which we should do, that wouldn\u2019t fix the core problem, which is human ego. We need to change the way that we view ourselves, the way we relate to ourselves, and hence the rest of the world. That\u2019s the connection with technology. Once we can change that identity, that creates the opportunity for entirely new patterns of behavior and for solving these problems. The big hope is that there are these moments in time, when we get a shift in perspective. And that shift in perspective changes everything. Humans have been speaking vocally and passing down culture for somewhere between 100,000 and 300,000 years. For whales and dolphins, it\u2019s 34 million years. Generally the things that are wisest will have lasted longest. Imagine what kind of wisdom there can be in cultures that have been going on for 34 million years. It just gives me goosebumps. Do you have in mind what you want people\u2019s perspective to be shifted toward? Yeah. I think it\u2019s a stance of interdependence. If, generally speaking, you can empathize and you see someone else, or some other being as less than other, then suddenly, you\u2019re more connected than you were before and your sphere of care expands. Many linguists understand human language to be tied up in our own brain structure and life experiences. Obviously both of those things are very different when we talk about animals. Maybe there are whale concepts that humans couldn\u2019t possibly understand. Do you think it is actually possible to have a conversation with a whale? Or is it more like you would need to interpret what the whale is saying in a much more abstract way? I think it\u2019s really important to hold these two poles. On one side, there\u2019s being too anthropomorphic. Where you think, we have these feelings, therefore the animals do. On the other side, there\u2019s human exceptionalism where we think we are so special that we don\u2019t share anything with other animals. And of course, the truth is going to be somewhere in between. I think there are going to be some things that we\u2019re going to find a similarity with, that we can directly communicate about, and then there are going to be the things that we don\u2019t share. And therefore, that part will be a much more metaphorical kind of communication. And I don\u2019t know, actually, which one is going to be more exciting. Will it be the parts that we can directly translate into human experience or the ones that we can\u2019t? But I think what people often forget is this, this shared set of experiences is large. [Raskin shares his screen.] Here is a pilot whale who has been carrying her dead calf for three weeks. Grief is clearly some kind of really profound shared experience. Here is a chimp who is browsing Instagram, who is able to use it, and actually uses it often to follow other chimps. So there\u2019s something here that is truly conserved. The answer is, of course, we don\u2019t know because we\u2019re doing science. This is a journey into the unknown. But we should keep a very open mind, not to fall into human exceptionalism. Just like we shouldn\u2019t fall into anthropomorphism. I want to shift gears and talk about social media. You helped coin the term \u201cfreedom of speech is not freedom of reach.\u201d To what extent do you feel like that concept has had an impact? And to what extent do you think that there\u2019s still more to be done? I think it\u2019s been a really helpful concept to get out in the world. Ren\u00e9e DiResta, who ended up penning the article that got that concept out into the world, has done a fantastic job. It clearly has done good work but needs to do more, because we are constantly trapped in the false dichotomy of saying, either we have content moderation, censorship, or we have free speech. But that phrase is pointing at a bigger thing, which is that we need to be thinking as a society as a whole. Facebook\u2019s stock price has dropped by half, which I don\u2019t think is just us, of course. But while we\u2019ve had success, the stakes are even higher now, because we are still the commodity. Just like a tree is worth more as lumber than as a living tree, and a whale is worth more dead than alive, we are going to be worth more as polarized, distracted, narcissistic, tribalistic people, than we are as full, whole individuals. Shoshana Zuboff points out that capitalism takes things that are outside of the market and pulls them into the market. And once they\u2019re in the market, then you can extract, abstract, deplete and pollute. And that\u2019s what\u2019s happened with human attention and engagement. It was outside of the market, it\u2019s now inside the market. We need to think about the next layer up. We know that if you let markets run without any guardrails, they will always grow to break the thing they\u2019re growing inside of. If your liver starts to grow, not listening to anything else, it\u2019ll eventually take over your body and you die. That\u2019s how cancer works. And so markets always need to come with guardrails, to keep them safe for the body they\u2019re growing within. We\u2019ve done that for capital markets. We do it for things like human organs. We have never done it with human attention or engagement. That\u2019s a market that needs guardrails, otherwise, you\u2019re constantly going to have like the race to the bottom of the brainstem. When I think about it at an even higher level, there\u2019s this fundamental equation. Technology plus autocracy equals stronger autocracy. But technology plus democracy equals worse democracy. And if we do not solve that problem, then the values that we care most about will not have a seat in the future. Powerful machine learning systems are rapidly becoming accessible to businesses and members of the public. Some can generate realistic images. Others can generate realistic text. It took 10 years for technologists to force through a coherent set of guidelines for social media, and social media destabilized our world in the meantime. Now we\u2019re seeing a very similar revolution at its earliest stages in terms of accessible generative AI. What do you think a few ethical red lines should be for technologies like GPT-3 and Dall-E? Who knew that AI was going to come first for art, story and relationships? The story has always been that it takes our jobs first. But actually it\u2019s coming for things that we think are very core to human identity. And we have not yet grappled with all of that. I think there are some simple things that work across social media and AI. And that is: the scale of impact needs to scale with the kinds of guardrails you\u2019re within. That is, if you\u2019re touching a million people, versus touching 500 million or a billion people, you should probably have different standards that you\u2019re operating to, compared to if you\u2019re only touching 50 people. The next one is, you\u2019re going to have to move to a world where we know that when something is posted online, it\u2019s posted by a human. And that\u2019s scary for a whole bunch of reasons. All of a sudden, it means you need to have stronger identity protections on the internet, which, if you don\u2019t do it right, opens up a whole bunch of authoritarian surveillance stuff. But the flip side is, if we don\u2019t do any of that, then we are witnessing the end of video and photographic evidence as a medium that we trust. That\u2019s a neutron bomb for trust on the internet. So we\u2019re gonna have to thread that needle between privacy, individual safety, ability to speak and express, and also society\u2019s ability to hear and make sense. We\u2019re going have to balance those things. And the last one is, I think one of the biggest lessons that Silicon Valley has not yet learned is that \u201cdemocratize\u201d does not equal \u201cdemocracy.\u201d If you put James Bond supervillain weapons in everyone\u2019s hands, something bad is going to happen. The way I\u2019ve been thinking about it is, even the phrase \u201cchatbots\u201d is the wrong phrase to use. Because that puts your mind back to the 1990s. Every time you say \u201cchatbot,\u201d replace it with \u201csynthetic relationship.\u201d Recently there was the Google engineer who was fired for believing his language model was sentient. And the takeaway is not whether it\u2019s sentient or not. That\u2019s the wrong question to ask. The right question to ask is, if he believes that he\u2019s in a relationship with this language model that\u2019s so profound that he\u2019s willing to stand up and get fired, that means a lot of people are going to feel that the language models they encounter are sentient. Suddenly you get this realization that relationships are the most transformative technology human beings have. So that means loneliness is about to become one of the largest national security threats. Just as an example, there are relationship scams, where people go on Tinder, and they start a relationship, and then they end up getting scammed and asked for money. We should expect this harnessing of people\u2019s lack of cohesion, lack of meaning, lack of belonging to a group or community. So we need to get in front of this. Read More: Fun AI Apps Are Everywhere Right Now. But a Safety \u2018Reckoning\u2019 Is Coming How do you suggest we do that? First we need to have an actual honest conversation about these things. Because right now we\u2019re stuck in the conversation about how this is a neat piece of technology. Versus what does this mean? What are the asymmetric powers that are about to be deployed? For lawyers, who have an asymmetric power over their clients, they have a duty to act in the client\u2019s best interest. We need to recategorize technology of this power as being in a fiduciary relationship. The paradox of technology is that it gives us the power to serve and protect at the exact same time as it gives us the power to exploit. So we are either entering into our darkest night, if we\u2019re continually trapped by perverse incentives, or our most golden era. It\u2019s going to be a touch-and-go relay race, from utopia to dystopia, until the final act. And I think of both the Center for Humane Technology and the Earth Species Project as trying to bend that arc systemically towards the golden era versus our darkest night.",

    "content": "Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen believes inflation should continue to recede over the next year unless there are some unexpected shocks to the global economy, according to a CBS report. Yellen does believe there is a risk of recession. \u201cBut it certainly isn't, in my view, something that is necessary to bring inflation down,\" Yellen told 60 Minutes correspondent Norah O'Donnell . Also Read: How To Invest In Startups \"Economic growth is slowing substantially. And businesses see that. Look, we had a very rapid recovery from the pandemic. Economic growth was very high. And there was a surge in hiring, put people back to work. We got people back to work. We closed that gap. We have a healthy labor market. To bring down inflation, and because almost everybody who wants a job has a job, growth has to slow,\" Yellen said. The Treasury Secretary also pointed out the United States is at or beyond full employment. \u201cAnd so it is not necessary for the economy to grow as rapidly as it has been growing to put people back to work,\" she said. Price Action: Major Wall Street indices closed in the red on Friday following the release of a higher-than-expected producers' price index reading. All attention turned towards the consumer price inflation set to be released on Tuesday and the crucial FOMC meeting where the Fed is expected to hike its policy rates by 50 basis points on Wednesday.

And, well, we\u2019ll have to wait and see what the outcome is; either way, it may be disastrous for the market.\u201d FOX Business reporter Eleanor Terrett, though, tweeted back, \u201cIt\u2019s not true.\u201d According to a follow-up tweet, the reporter confirmed that her sources had advised her there was no truth to the story.\u00a0 Hoskinson\u2019s rumor has impacted the crypto sector and altcoin pricing negatively and has left the XRP community fuming. Widespread Disruption Crypto whales trade over 392 million XRP in one day as reports of a settlement in the case between Ripple and the SEC spread.\u00a0 Recent days have seen information concerning significant XRP moves being shared by Whale Alert, a cryptocurrency whale tracking service. According to the most recent transactions, the whales are moving huge sums of XRP to and from exchanges. According to Whale Alert, these high-net-worth cryptocurrency investors have moved a staggering 392,764,221 (392.76M) XRP tokens in the last 24 hours.\u00a0 The significant XRP movement coincides with the spread of reports regarding a potential resolution to the current legal dispute between Ripple and the SEC. XRP Whale Transfer According to the information provided by the crypto whale tracking service, the most recent transaction occurred on December 12 \u2013 a withdrawal of 38,893,182 (38.89M) XRP worth $14.4M by an unnamed whale. 38,893,182 #XRP (14,445,395 USD) transferred from #Binance to unknown wallethttps://t.co/ARa6oyDx2j\u2014 Whale Alert (@whale_alert) December 12, 2022 In addition, two anonymous whales shuffled 188.5M XRP worth $72.83M. Unknown whale withdrew 30M XRP ($11.67M) from Bitso. 188,500,000 #XRP (72,837,378 USD) transferred from unknown wallet to unknown wallethttps://t.co/Xg4e7FG22f\u2014 Whale Alert (@whale_alert) December 12, 2022 Another Binance user withdrew 37,371,039 XRP tokens ($14.14M) to an unknown address. XRP whales have flipped huge amounts of cryptocurrency since the news spread.\u00a0 How Will XRP Be Impacted? Our next move is to sit tight and watch. While this is going on, there is a lot of conjecture regarding the case\u2019s outcome in the surrounding community. As the verdict draws closer, we can anticipate a direct effect on the XRP prices. Traders need to move cautiously because of the market\u2019s potential volatility. In theory, XRP\u2019s price may rise between 50 and 60 cents. Conversely, pumps and dumps could happen in response to such news, leading to a significant decline in the XRP price. For blockchain, this will be the next major disaster. If the claims are true, XRP might be directly impacted by a high-profile legal ruling, which is difficult to foresee.",

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission charged FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried with defrauding equity investors and customers of the bankruptcy cryptocurrency exchange. SBF was also arrested in the Bahamas after authorities received formal confirmation of criminal charges against Bankman-Fried in the United States. Southern District of New York prosecutors charged Sam Bankman-Fried with wire fraud, securities fraud, and money laundering, per the New York Times. USA Damian Williams: Earlier this evening, Bahamian authorities arrested Samuel Bankman-Fried at the request of the U.S. Government, based on a sealed indictment filed by the SDNY. We expect to move to unseal the indictment in the morning and will have more to say at that time.\u2014 US Attorney SDNY (@SDNYnews) December 12, 2022 SEC vs Sam Bankman-Fried According to the SECs filing, SBF deceived equity investors of FTX Trading Ltd while also defrauding retail customers as well. The commission noted that Bankman-Fried raised over $1.8 billion from investors between May 2019 and November 2022. The SEC said SBF branded himself as a \u201cresponsible leader of the crypto community\u201d while \u201corchestrating a massive, years-long fraud\u201d.\u00a0 Customers around the world believed his lies, and sent billions of dollars to FTX, believing their assets were secure on the FTX trading platform. But from the start, Bankman-Fried improperly diverted customer assets to his privately-held crypto hedge fund, Alameda Research LLC (\u201cAlameda\u201d), and then used those customer funds to make undisclosed venture investments, lavish real estate purchases, and large political donations. Tuesday\u2019s filing noted that Bankman-Fried continued funding Alameda with FTX customer deposits when his trading giant was unable to meet loan obligations after the crypto crash in May 2022.\u00a0 The SECs filing argued that Alameda was bolstered with FTX customer assets in order to keep up appearances and maintain access to cash injections from investors and lenders. Also, the charges confirmed that company assets were used to fund personal loans to SBF and other top FTX executives. But Bankman-Fried did not stop there. Even as it was increasingly clear that Alameda and FTX could not make customers whole, Bankman-Fried continued to misappropriate FTX customer funds. Through the summer of 2022, he directed hundreds of millions more in FTX customer funds to Alameda, which he then used for additional venture investments and for \u201cloans\u201d to himself and other FTX executives. Sam Bankman-Fried was the first to face charges following FTX\u2019s collapse in November 2022. The fallen crypto tycoon was in custody and awaiting possible extradition to the U.S. at press time.

    "description": "Several key factors mean that we're unlikely to face a major COVID-19 surge this winter, argue Drs. Michael Daignault and Monica Gandhi",
    "content": "At this time last year and two years ago, daily new infections and covid-related hospitalizations were already accelerating at a fast clip. BQ.1 and BQ.1.1, the latest Omicron subvariants, came to comprise the majority of cases during a relative lull in the pandemic. Combined with a Thanksgiving Holiday that saw the most travelers since the pandemic started, there has been a steady increase in covid metrics. However, there are many reasons to be optimistic. A combination of factors\u2014a high level of population immunity, Omicron family antigenic drift, convergence of mutations that seem to have hit an evolutionary ceiling, almost nonexistent severe covid illness in the hospital, and viral interference from RSV and Influenza surges\u2014means we are in a surprisingly good place with COVID-19 in winter 2022-23. [time-brightcove not-tgx=\u201dtrue\u201d] Antigenic drift The first two pandemic years were marked by surge after surge driven by variants of entirely new lineages. But since South African researchers first identified Omicron one year ago, we have seen subvariants exclusively from that lineage. This antigenic drift, while spawning an alphabet soup of approximately 500 subvariants, has actually generated less and less impactful waves as population level immunity to Omicron grew. The most recent summer wave driven by BA.4 and BA.5 did not lead to a significant surge of hospitalizations or deaths in the U.S. Before the Omicron winter surge a year ago, only 1 in 3 people in the U.S. had been infected with COVID-19. By the end of February, that number was 60%\u2014and certainly much higher now at the end of 2022. It\u2019s safe to say a lot of immune systems have \u201cseen\u201d Omicron by this point on top of a vaccination rate of 73% in those 5 and older. As long as there is not a dramatic antigenic shift to an entirely new lineage, there are very little new tricks Omicron can throw our way. But, if such a shift were to happen, our T-cells and memory B-cells will continue to provide robust protection against severe disease from new variants. Evolutionary ceiling Recent research showed marked resistance of the BQ.1. and BQ.1.1 subvariants (among others) to neutralizing antibodies in the sera of both triple-vaccinated and those recently infected with BA.1 and BA.5. This immune evasiveness is due to a key N460 mutation in the spike protein of BQ.1 and BQ.1.1 and to a lesser extent, R346t and N658S mutations. The new Omicron subvariants are accruing mutations at a breakneck speed that in theory give them an exponential growth advantage over their BA.2 and BA.5 parentage. But interestingly, the multiple subvariants are converging on the same mutations. Despite their demonstrated immune evasiveness prowess in the lab, they have not led to significant waves in countries where they become dominant. The XBB variant achieved dominance in Singapore earlier this Fall. XBB is a descendant of BA.2 but differs by 8 key spike mutations. Despite these apparent growth advantages, XBB did not lead to a major surge in hospitalizations or deaths in Singapore. Although important to tread carefully when comparing countries, France\u2019s recent experience with BQ.1.1 likely provides insight into how that variant will play out here. France and the U.S. share a lagging updated bivalent booster rate for those at higher risk for severe COVID illness (older individuals)\u2014approximately 30% of those 65 years or older in both countries have received the updated booster. BQ.1.1 became dominant in France at the end of October but has not led to a surge in hospitalizations or ICU admissions. So, a convergence of rapidly accruing mutations demonstrating immune evasiveness in the lab has not generated a surge in infections or hospitalizations in the real world. This certainly begs the question: has SARS-COV-2 hit an evolutionary ceiling in the face of our high population immunity? Where have severe COVID-19 patients gone? We rarely encounter patients with severe COVID in the ED or hospital wards now, in sharp contrast to the winter of 2020. By severe COVID, we are referring to patients with viral pneumonia and hypoxia requiring various oxygen-delivery and ventilation systems and strategies, intravenous decatron and other complicated immune-modulating medications, and the involvement of respiratory therapists and multiple medical specialists. The majority of states and county public health departments still do not delineate COVID-19 hospitalizations between those admitted primarily for COVID vs. those who incidentally test positive. The CDC in fact in September advised that hospitals could stop routine pre-admission testing for COVID. But many hospitals and health care systems have been reluctant to relinquish this outdated practice. As such, given the ability of BQ.1 and BQ.1.1 to evade neutralizing antibodies, we expect an increase in country-level hospitalization numbers this winter due to incidental positives, but we should be reassured that the vast majority will not be for severe COVID illness. In fact, since the advent of Omicron, multiple studies have demonstrated that Omicron is just not very good at infecting lung tissue. As early as January 2022, we had multiple laboratory studies showing that Omicron had an affinity for replicating rapidly in the upper airways but markedly less tropism for alveolar lung cells. This viral evolutionary trade-off likely explains how a large Kaiser Southern California study comparing 223,000 Omicron infections to 23,000 Delta variant infections found that those infected with Omicron had significantly less risk of severe illness and shorter hospital stays. And a new South African study shows that the risk of hospitalization and mortality declined even further from the BA.1/BA.2 wave to the BA.4/5 wave. Viral interference RSV has led a troupe of viral respiratory illness in children that has quickly overwhelmed children\u2019s hospitals and flooded emergency rooms across the country. At the same time, as we observed in the Southern Hemisphere countries, the influenza season kicked off approximately two months earlier than usual. As of the most recent CDC FluView report, there have already been over 6.2 million flu illnesses, 53,000 hospitalizations and 2,900 deaths. Flu is being driven by the more virulent Flu A strain, 78% of which has been H3N2, which is known to cause more severe illness in children and the elderly. Importantly, the U.K. reported this past week that ICU admissions for flu exceeded those for COVID for the first time during the pandemic. This is likely due to the reduced severity of COVID and high level of population immunity as well as the dominance of the Flu A (H3N2) strain. The early surges of RSV and flu raises the interesting question of viral interference. Is it possible that earlier-than-usual surges in RSV, flu, and other viral respiratory illnesses are crowding out covid this year? A growing body of both epidemiological and laboratory data suggest that the dreaded tripledemic is unlikely. One theory points to chemical messengers triggered by a viral infection called interferons that generate a population level immunity barrier against another virus. For the first two years of the pandemic, non-COVID viral illness was crowded out by COVID. This winter, the opposite could be occurring. Of note, this resurgence of endemic viruses, such as influenza and RSV, as population immunity rose to COVID and with decreased immunity to other viruses over the past 2.5 years, was predicted in June 2020. New vax effective especially at extended intervals Lastly, we finally have real-world data on the effectiveness of the new bivalent Covid booster. While the CDC study did not answer the question of whether the bivalent booster is better than another dose of the original vaccine recipe, the bivalent booster provides protection against symptomatic infection from BA.5. And the study clearly demonstrated that a longer gap between doses generated a bigger immune boost; we advocated for a 6-month extended interval in a recent piece in TIME. Older individuals in the US need the COVID booster (and a higher influenza vaccine dose) the most given a less robust immune response populations 65 and older. What next? We are in good shape as we head into this third pandemic winter with BQ.1 and BQ.1.1 holding the reins. This does not mean we will rest on our laurels. For the first time, we do not have an effective monoclonal antibody treatment for those immune-compromised or high-risk for severe covid illness. Both BQ.1. and BQ.1.1 are resistant to our last effective monoclonal antibody treatment, bebtelovimab. We urgently need an armamentarium of second-generational monoclonals that can supersede the convergence of immune evasive mutations exhibited by the Omicron subvariants. Nearly 9 in 10 covid deaths are in people 65 or older. However only 32% of this group has received an updated bivalent booster. Paxlovid use in this group is also woeful despite evidence that this age group benefits the most from its use. Older individuals need ongoing boosting and treatment as we enter COVID endemicity in this third winter living with this now not-so-novel coronavirus.",

Although the market has treated many harshly, more and more individuals have begun to embrace cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin, and therefore trading platforms such as Coinbase have recorded increased user growth in recent times and appear to be rather unaffected by the prolonged bear market. Reports by Finbold suggest that Coinbase has added 19 million verified users globally between December 31, 2021, and September 30, 2022 \u2013 a growth percentage of 21.35%. According to this data, the platform has added at least two million users per month in 2022. The data presented by Finbold indicates that Coinbase had 98 million users \u2013 an addition of nine million users from the 2021 Q4 figure of 89 million.

    "content": "The Central Bank of Brazil plans to introduce its digital currency by 2024, President of the bank Roberto Campos Neto said at a conference. Additionally, he thought that by doing this, the financial industry would be more inclusive of a diverse spectrum of individuals. \u201cI think that this digitized, paid-in, integrated system, with inclusion, will help a lot in the development and inclusion of people in the financial world.\u201d\u00a0 He continued by saying that more inclusivity, reduced costs, intermediation, competition with fewer entry barriers, efficiency in risk management, monetization of data, and full tokenization of capital assets and contracts characterize the Brazilian digital economy. Many inside the Brazilian government worry that the tokenized system will damage the central bank\u2019s balance sheet. Still, the president reassured them that it wouldn\u2019t affect the system\u2019s monetary policies because it inherits all present deposit-related legislation. Furthermore, Campos Neto claims that IMF officials have written to the central bank and left comments stating that this approach seems to be the easiest to implement and that other central banks should investigate it further. Prior to this, the Brazilian Congress passed a measure on November 30, 2022, regulating the use of cryptocurrencies as a means of payment in Brazil. This might assist in advancing the use of digital assets in the South American nation. The law would legalize cryptocurrency payments for goods and services but not give them the status of legal cash (it still requires the president\u2019s approval). This suggests that financial institutions may soon begin offering cryptocurrency payment services, therefore facilitating the purchase and sale of ordinary goods using cryptocurrencies in a way similar to how people already use credit cards or other services of a similar nature.

    "content": "The post Popular Analyst Maps Next Levels For Bitcoin (BTC) Price appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News At the time this article was written, Bitcoin (BTC), the most prominent cryptocurrency, has been trading in the green for some time. Its value has increased by almost 7% in the previous week and by 2% in the past day, reaching a worth of $18,101. The last week has been quite successful for Bitcoin (BTC), as the currency reached new monthly highs on December 13 as a wave of confidence spread across markets in response to inflation statistics from the United States. Analyst Says The Worst Might Be Over For Bitcoin Back in May 2021, a pseudonymous cryptocurrency analyst known only as Dave the Wave accurately predicted that Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) price would drop. Now, he is claiming that an indicator implies that the token may already have experienced the worst of the bear market. The expert shares with his 131,700 Twitter followers that he is also keeping a close check on Bitcoin\u2019s moving average convergence divergence (MACD), which is a momentum indicator that may or may not indicate a change in trend. The worst of it is over if the #BTC monthly histogram is anything to go by.The TA corrects the sentiment\u2026 which swings wildly with depression at the bottom to match euphoria at the top. pic.twitter.com/BcpWokoMAN\u2014 dave the wave (@davthewave) December 12, 2022 The weekly MACD for Bitcoin (BTC) continues to trade higher above a support level that, according to Dave the Wave, has previously marked the end of bear markets in 2015 and 2018. The expert believes that the worst of it is behind us now based on BTC\u2019s MACD. According to Dave the Wave, the emotion lurches erratically from depression at the bottom to euphoria at the peak, and the technical analysis helps to rectify these swings.\u00a0 Furthermore, he forecasts a Bitcoin rise toward $19,000 after the king cryptocurrency exceeded its immediate barrier at $17,300. This prediction comes after the price of Bitcoin surpassed $17,300. The level of $17,000 is a key level of support for BTC, and if the bulls can maintain their position above this level, then additional upward momentum is anticipated. The present value of the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is 66, which indicates that the market is still in the zone of being overbought. A bullish trend is indicated by the MACD indicator, which is currently located above the zero line. Bitcoin Price 2023 There is no consensus between analysts about what the future of BTC will be like in 2023. Although some predict a rise in value, others believe it will continue to fall, maybe even below $10,000. However, optimism for risk assets has been bolstered by Tuesday\u2019s U.S. inflation data, which confirmed the Fed\u2019s plan to ease its liquidity tightening. So, who knows? The next year can turn out to be quite prosperous for BTC. It is also possible that it will remain under pressure since a number of mining companies are expected to fail, which would overshadow the improvement in macroeconomic circumstances. Personally, I think that investors should anticipate more gains.",

    "content": "Suplyd, a procurement platform for hotels, restaurants and catering (HoReCa) businesses in Egypt, has raised $1.6 million pre-seed funding from Endure Capital, Seedstars, Camel Ventures, Falak Startups, and a number of angel investors. Founded in January this year, Suplyd\u2019s B2B platform brings efficiency in the supply chain operations for businesses in the food service industry by allowing digital order procurement, payment, and fulfillment. Through its platform, restaurants get access to a wide range of products on demand , saving them man hours wasted in sourcing for goods offline. It also ensures that the businesses acquire the goods at competitive prices. Suplyd plans to use the new funding to scale its technology and expand within and beyond Cairo, and to explore other growth opportunities in Middle-East and North Africa (MENA) region in the near future. \u201cRestaurants\u2019 supply chain is a global issue, where everyone right now is looking into how to cut costs and reduce waste. However, the Egyptian market is extremely big yet untapped, and that\u2019s where we direct our efforts for the next phase before we expand to other global markets,\u201d said Gohar Said, Suplyd CEO who co-founded the startup with Karim Selima, and Ahmed ElMahdy. Said, a restaurateur for 12 years, Suplyd is bringing an e-commerce experience to the restaurant supply chain, by optimizing assets, reducing waste for the whole ecosystem, while saving the businesses time and effort used to communicate and follow up with suppliers. The startup\u2019s network of tech-enabled fulfillment centers, offers the Suplyd insights on demand patterns and trends that informs stocking, to ensure restaurants supplies needs are fulfilled on demand, and avoid waste on suppliers end too. \u201cIn a normal scenario, restaurants have to go out to the market looking for suppliers for their SKUs, then they start validating their prices. If the right match happens, which is not always the case, the fulfillment risk takes place, whether because of tight delivery windows, order placement restrictions, or quantity issues,\u201d said Said. \u201cWhat Suplyd is offering is a digital procurement engine, a platform where it makes it easy for restaurants to buy supplies at considerably cheaper rates than open market prices, exposes restaurants to a wide range of SKUs, guarantees fulfillment through a single platform, and simplifies the transaction and the delivery process. It also benefits suppliers with real-time analytics and actionable insights when it comes to demand patterns and trends,\u201d he said. Suplyd says it is currently serving 500 customers in greater Cairo, having grown by almost 50% month over month since launch. The startup, which is stepping up competition for players like OneOrder, expects greater growth over the next one year sustained by its expansion plans geared towards serving Egypt\u2019s vast HoReCa industry, which is supported by over 400,000 restaurants. Tarek Fahim, general partner at Endure Capital said: \u201cEating out is a major part of social life in the Middle East, but the supply chain that enables restaurants to serve customers is highly fragmented. We are thrilled to support the team and the platform Suplyd is building to digitize the supply chain for restaurants, improving efficiency and reducing food waste in our communities.\u201d With $3M new funding, Egyptian startup OneOrder sets out on growth drive Orda raises millions to digitize African restaurants with its cloud-based operating system Egypt\u2019s Suplyd raises $1.6M to digitize restaurants supply chain by Annie Njanja originally published on TechCrunch",

    "content": "The post Win Up to $1k in the QuickSwap And VersaGames TikTok Contest appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News QuickSwap and Versa Games are hosting a TikTok Contest and giving away $1,750 in USDC to the top 3 winners. The first place winner of the contest will receive $1,000, the second $500, and the third $250.\u00a0 QuickSwap and Versa Games believe that this will be another fun, different, and exciting way to introduce the largest Gaming Platform on the Polygon network to the Gaming, CyberPunk, and Crypto Communities world-wide. Companies not involved in Web3 have run numerous successful and viral TikTok campaigns.\u00a0 Some of which have been from brands and companies like Gymshark, Mercedes Benz, and Crocs to name a few.\u00a0 35% of TikTok users are between 19-29 and are seemingly obsessed with TikTok. They spend an average of 68 minutes per day on the platform. So, it will be interesting to see how well this contest performs for not only the gaming world but for the crypto community in general.\u00a0 The contest is set to run from December 13th until January 1st.\u00a0 There are very few rules for entry aside from following the standard TikTok community guidelines, having to mention VersaGames a few times in the video, and using the hashtags #JustPlay and #QuickSwapGamingHub.\u00a0 Crypto Influencer NrdGrl007 says \u201cshe looks forward to working with QuickSwap and VersaGames closely on this project by helping review what they all expect to be a wide variety of extremely fun and entertaining submissions.\u201d The companies say they are both looking forward to a wide variety of fun, entertaining, and hopefully some unexpected and off the wall contest submissions.\u00a0 QuickSwap and VersaGames continue to stand behind the belief that Web3 gaming should not just be viewed as Play-To-Earn or a \u201cjob-like task\u201d but rather as gaming for fun which also provides financial incentives through NFTs and ownership. Therefore, it makes sense that QuickSwap and VersaGames would be the first Web3 gaming hub to offer their audiences and users the opportunity to engage with the platform, be creative, have fun making videos, and to reward the games\u2019 fans financially for taking part in the community-oriented contest.\u00a0\u00a0 Submit your entry here: https://gleam.io/jiIOW/quickswap-gaming-hub-tiktok-video-contest-powered-by-versa-games-polygon-network Disclaimer: This is a press release post.

    "content": "IcomTech and Forcount, also known as Weltsys, were two cryptocurrency Ponzi schemes run by nine people, according to the U.S. Department of Justice\u2018s announcement on Wednesday. \u201cWith these two indictments, this office is sending a message to all cryptocurrency scammers: We are coming for you. Stealing is stealing, even when dressed up in the jargon of cryptocurrency,\u201d said Damian Williams, U.S. Attorney. IcomTech and Forcount, according to the DOJ, were allegedly cryptocurrency mining and trading businesses that promised investors returns in exchange for buying investment products involving cryptocurrencies. Investing methods for victims included cash, cheques, wire transfers, and cryptocurrencies. U.S. Attorney announces fraud and money laundering charges against the founders and promoters of two cryptocurrency Ponzi schemeshttps://t.co/xyDjz0J4Q0\u2014 US Attorney SDNY (@SDNYnews) December 14, 2022 The DOJ charged David Carmona, Marco Ruiz Ochoa, Moses Valdez, Juan Arellano, David Brend, and Gustavo Rodriguez in the first indictment with conspiring to conduct wire fraud because of their ties to IcomTech. According to the agency, the plan was active from mid-2018 to late 2019. The DOJ charged Francisley Da Silva, Juan Tacori, and Antonia Perez Hernandez in the second indictment for their alleged participation in Forcount, which it claimed operated an alleged Ponzi scheme from mid-2017 through late 2021. Silva and Tacuri are also accused of conspiring to launder money. \u201cThe founders and promoters of each scheme falsely promised their respective victims, among other things, that profits from the companies\u2019 cryptocurrency trading and mining would result in guaranteed daily returns on victims\u2019 investments and doubling those investments within six months.\u201d Authorities assert that neither business is genuinely engaged in cryptocurrency trading or mining. The global operation was promoted with \u201clavish\u201d expo displays to entice new victims, and the perpetrators\u2019 used \u2018victim\u2019 money to reimburse additional victims while also enriching themselves. According to the DOJ, the proponents of the scams said that the \u201cIcoms\u201d and \u201cMindexcoin\u201d tokens would one day be worth a substantial sum of money. The organization claims that they were virtually useless, costing victims money. \u201cWhile Victims saw \u2018profits\u2019 accumulate on the schemes\u2019 respective online portals, most victims were unable to withdraw any of these so-called profits and ultimately lost their entire investments. By contrast, IcomTech and Forcount\u2019s promoters siphoned off, in some cases, hundreds of thousands of dollars in victim funds, which they withdrew as cash, spent on promotional expenses for the schemes, and used for personal expenditures such as luxury goods and real estate,\u201d prosecutors said. The Money Laundering and Transnational Criminal Enterprises Unit of the Justice Department are handling the case.

    "description": "<p>Finance Magnates spoke with the CEO of Enya Labs, Alan Chiu on Boba\u2019s plan to scale the future of web3.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal text-align-start\">Post the ETH merge, is there still a need for L2s?</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">The ETH Merge simply changed the consensus mechanism of Ethereum, but didn't increase its computational capacity. Even looking beyond the Merge, L2s are a fundamental part of the Ethereum scaling architecture by taking execution off L1.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal text-align-start\">There are a bunch of L2 scaling solutions out there, what separates Boba from the rest?</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Boba is the only smart contract platform (not just among L2s) that enables calls from smart contracts to off chain APIs. This means developers can create dApps that query enterprise datastores, interact with gaming engines and web2 services, and take advantage of computationally intensive capabilities such as machine learning.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal text-align-start\">Boba is the first multi-chain L2, currently integrated with ETH, Avalanche, Moonbeam, & BNB. Do you plan on integrating other chains?</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">There are definitely additional L1s on the horizon that will be supported by Boba.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal text-align-start\">They say that Bear Markets are a time for building. What is Boba currently building that you are most excited about?</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">The list is long! Let me start with account abstraction, which will enable developers to deliver a much smoother UX by letting them pay for gas on the users\u2019 behalf. Then there\u2019s Anchorage, which is the next version of the Boba execution engine, built in Erigon. It\u2019s going to help diversify the L2 client space (and therefore improve the overall robustness of L2s), and allow more flexible fault proving mechanisms since it will adhere to the Bedrock yellowpaper.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal text-align-start\">What is EIP-4844 and why is it important?</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">EIP-4844, or Proto-Danksharding, introduces a new Ethereum transaction type that accepts blobs of data to be stored on a beacon node for about 2 weeks (unlike CALLDATA, which is stored forever). This means the data that\u2019s only useful for validating L2 transactions can be stored much more cheaply in blobs, reducing gas fees by orders of magnitude.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal text-align-start\">What is your take on the whole FTX/Alameda situation? What lessons should be learned?</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">The situation serves as a stark reminder of the core benefits delivered by blockchains but we often forget: Transparency, immutability, and decentralization, which eliminate the possibility of singular actors performing fraudulent transactions in the dark. </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">As infrastructure builders, we need to continually make it easier for developers to adopt platforms where these core tenets are the default.</p> This article was written by Finance Magnates Staff at www.financemagnates.com.",

    "content": "We are two Indigenous women leaders writing from the frontlines of the battle to save our oceans, our forests, and our planet\u2019s climate. We have good news to share: We know how to beat Big Oil. From the Amazon rainforest to the shores of the Indian Ocean in South Africa, we have led our communities to mighty victories against oil companies who hoped to profit off our territories. In September 2022, we succeeded in getting a court to revoke a permit that would have allowed Shell to despoil Indigenous farming communities and fishing grounds along the pristine Wild Coast of South Africa. Just a few years earlier in April 2019, we organized Indigenous communities deep in the Ecuadorian rainforests to resist the government\u2019s plans to drill in pristine rainforests and were victorious, protecting half a million acres of forests and setting a legal precedent to protect millions more. [time-brightcove not-tgx=\u201dtrue\u201d] Both were David vs. Goliath victories\u2014and both were opportunities for us to learn where to point that fabled slingshot. Big Oil has the deepest of pockets and a horrific track record when it comes to corruption, scandal, and environmental crimes. Across the world, Indigenous and local communities know that once the industry gets a foothold in our lands, it leaves ruin in its wake. For instance, the A\u2019i Cof\u00e1n people of Ecuador\u2019s northern Amazon have borne the brunt of decades of oil industry contamination, deforestation, and health impacts. And the Ogoni people of the Niger Delta have lost their fishing and farming lands to polluting oil operations, and have seen their leaders threatened and murdered when they dared to speak out. Read More: Biden May Be About to Sign Off on a Huge Alaska Oil Drilling Project As frontline communities, we must work together to stop Big Oil before they enter our lands. But this, in itself, is no easy task. The industry offers alluring promises of \u201cprogress\u201d and \u201cdevelopment.\u201d And they have people\u2014in government, the military, police forces, shadowy paramilitary groups, and sometimes in our own communities\u2014who are willing to intimidate, harass, and even kill leaders like us who have the courage to stand up to them. They also have billions of dollars riding on getting permits to suck the oil out of the ground and sea. So, how did we stop them? First, we kept our communities together. We fought against the industry\u2019s \u201cdivide and conquer\u201d tactics by grounding our battle in our own sacred connection to our lands. Our ancestors and elders understood, as we do today, that Mother Earth is sacred and worth fighting for. We are connected to her through our breath, our stories, our dreams, and our prayers. She gives us everything: water, food, medicine, shelter, meaning. And in return, we protect her. We also helped our people cut through the false promises and threats by exposing Big Oil\u2019s lies and abuse around the world. That is, we made sure our villagers could learn from the A\u2019i Cof\u00e1n people of Ecuador, the Ogoni of the Niger delta, and the countless other frontline communities that have suffered at the hands of Big Oil. As Indigenous women leaders, we know that if we can keep our sacred connection to the land and keep our people united, then we have a fighting chance against any oil company in the world. We also have the law on our side, which makes Big Oil really vulnerable. In 2007, the U.N. General Assembly adopted the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, which recognized our right to Free, Prior, and Informed Consent (FPIC) for any activity that affects our ancestral lands. Our shorthand is \u201cNothing About Us Without Us.\u201d We, Indigenous peoples, the ancestral owners of some of the most biodiverse, carbon-rich places on the planet (the places that the oil industry wants to get their hands on more than anything), have the internationally recognized legal right to decide what happens on our land. In South Africa, we were able to protect 6,000 square miles of pristine marine ecosystems off the Wild Coast, saving dolphins and whales from deafening seismic blasts on the ocean floor while also protecting local communities and our planet\u2019s climate from the threat of ramped-up offshore drilling. And on the other side of the world, in Ecuador, we leveraged our internationally recognized rights to protect some of the biodiverse rainforest in the Amazon, jamming the Ecuadorian Government\u2019s plans to drill across millions of acres of Indigenous territories. But the law alone isn\u2019t enough. To move courts and politicians\u2014and to create legal exposure and reputational risk to companies\u2014we need global community support to keep going. That means getting financial resources to the frontlines, so that we can protect our leaders, organize our communities, and secure our rights. Only a fraction of 1% of all climate funding currently makes it to Indigenous communities on the frontlines of the climate battle. We need to change that. It also means sharing our stories and shining a spotlight on our struggles, so that local courts and politicians know that the world is watching. Public solidarity not only prevents corruption and back-room deals, but it also energizes our grassroots campaigns. We need to continue to pressure governments around the world to finally adopt our internationally recognized right to decide what happens in our lands in their national laws and constitutions. Our peoples have been putting our bodies on the line in the battle to protect Mother Earth for centuries. It\u2019s not only a moral imperative that global governments finally recognize and respect our right to self-determination, but it is also one of the most urgent and effective climate strategies\u2014it\u2019s no coincidence that we are the guardians of over 80% of our planet\u2019s biodiversity. In the Amazon rainforest, half of the remaining standing forest is in our territories. Without us and without our territories, there is no climate solution. To have a fighting chance of keeping global warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius, we can\u2019t afford to be opening up new oil fields in the lungs of the earth. We need to keep our forests standing. We need to transition to renewable energy. We are writing this because we see that world leaders, businesses, and NGOs are only making slow, incremental progress on climate despite the urgent existential threat we face. Instead of getting frustrated, we\u2019re doubling down on sharing our formula with other Indigenous guardians on the ground. We know that time is not on our side\u2014but our spirituality and our rights are. So here\u2019s one idea from two Indigenous women leaders that beat the oil industry, and protected our oceans and our forests: Listen to us for a change.",

Despite a couple of bullish jumps, ETH price continues to remain under the bearish influence and also displays the possibility to remain bearish for a long time. Apart from the current descending trend, mass Ethereum selling may also kick off soon which may strengthen the bearish group over the space.\u00a0 The ETH price began with a fresh decline as it faced a rejection below $1300 which flashed huge bearish signals. The price which is now trading below $1290 at 100-hr SMA, broke below a major bullish trend line having as the support. Further, the price settled below 0.618 FIB levels from the upward wave to hit $1240 from the highs around $1349. Trading View The next major resistance for the ETH price could be around $1350, beyond which it may rise to test $1400. Moreover, extended gains may further rise towards $1480. On the contrary, if the ETH fails to surge beyond $1300, it is expected to drop toward $1260 or lower. In such case, the next major support levels could be around $1240, below which the price could gain bearish momentum towards $1200 support. More Bearish Pressure Incoming for Ethereum (ETH) Price Ethereum platform recently underwent a network upgrade, where-in it switched from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake without halting the platform. This transformation required the validators to stake ETH on ETH 2.0 platform. Interestingly, the total amount of ETH staked on the platform surpassed the required amount and is marking new highs every new day. Presently, the ETH 2.0 contract address holds nearly 12% of the entire supply which is getting shrunk with every transaction due to the burn mechanism. This may further lead to a huge drop in the exchange reserves while TVL could keep on rising high which is an alarming situation when the Shanghai Hard Fork is fast approaching.\u00a0 6/ After the Merge, the supply began to decline; 0.1MThe supply and demand dynamics will shift after the fork, $ETH price volatility is imminent.Will #Shanghai trigger mass-selling?Or is it an opportunity that provides more liquidity to buy more $ETHhttps://t.co/BeARRlcN4e pic.twitter.com/y09OdkC6z7\u2014 CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) December 16, 2022 As per a popular crypto analytical platform, the supply that has begun to decline since the Merge could change the supply & demand dynamics.

    "content": "The post <strong>Alert, Traders! There Shall Be A Crypto Washout Soon, Warns Expert</strong> appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News After reaching heady heights in 2021, the cryptocurrency market has had to weather a period of tightening monetary policy, which has resulted in sell-offs, the implosion of projects like Terra, the bankruptcy filings of CeFi companies like Celsius Network and Voyager Digital, and the ultimate collapse of the FTX exchange in 2022. Many in the crypto community are divided on whether or not 2023 will be a good year for cryptocurrencies. Due to the larger economy\u2019s difficulties, many analysts feel this downturn is unique. On the other hand, when asked whether 2023 would be a bullish or negative year, roughly 84% of respondents to a survey by CoinmarketCap said the former. After dropping to a low around the $10,000 to $12,000 level, the price of Bitcoin (BTC), the flagship cryptocurrency, may rise to $30,000 in the second half of 2023, according to a prediction by a fund manager at investing giant VanEck. However, analysts at JPMorgan believe that since crypto\u2019s image was severely damaged by the crises and scandals that occurred in 2022 and broader markets are suffering, another leg lower to $10,000 for BTC in 2023 may not be such an outlandish prediction. On the other hand, during an interview with Bloomberg, the chief investment officer at Guggenheim Partners, Scott Minerd, issued a warning to investors that more market disruptions are on the horizon in the wake of the recent failure of the cryptocurrency exchange FTX. When asked whether he thinks that there is going to be another shoe to drop in the financial stability aspect of the cryptocurrency sector, Minerd responded simply that yes, there is. \u201cThe reason is this is just like any number of periods where we had easy money and a lot of speculation; the weakest players fall first. Crypto was obviously something that is crazy.\u201d\u00a0 Guggenheim Partners CIO Scott Minerd is warning investors there will be more shakeouts to come following the collapse of crypto exchange FTX as years of easy money end https://t.co/Q6IhQAnvF1 pic.twitter.com/PoZVattuNk\u2014 Bloomberg Crypto (@crypto) December 15, 2022 He added that: \u201cA year ago we were talking about crypto, and there were approximately 19,000 coins. There is going to be a washout just like the Internet bubble.\u201d However, he reassured listeners that there will be survivors, noting that the transition to digital currency is still in its infancy and that its further development needs a legal and regulatory infrastructure. Furthermore, the Guggenheim executive made a comparison between the bitcoin sector and the dot-com bubble in his assessment. He also said that he had been unable to comprehend the excitement that had surrounded the non-fungible token (NFT) industry, which seemed to have subsided at this point. Bottomline Notably, the investor forecasted earlier this year that the price of Bitcoin might hit rock bottom at the amount of $8,000 before continuing its upward trend. Minerd has also predicted that the Federal Reserve\u2019s restrictive monetary policy would cause an increase in unemployment of around 2% over the course of the next two years. It remains to be seen whether his forecast for BTC will come to pass. The cryptocurrency has been trading in the negative for the previous 24 hours, now hovering around $17,000. Nonetheless, Minerd\u2019s forecasts are nothing more than his own opinions. He does not have the ability to predict the future with certainty. Analysts\u2019 forecasts should never be relied on blindly by investors. Anything can happen.",

    "description": "Police deception tactics can trick many innocent people into confessing to crimes they didn't commit, writes Saul Kassin.",
    "content": "Many Americans do not know that U.S. police are permitted to outright lie about evidence to someone they bring into the station for questioning. This is not lawful in most western countries. Incomprehensibly, they are even permitted to lie to children. Try explaining that to parents. This form of deception has tricked countless innocent people into confessing to crimes they did not commit. \u201cWe have surveillance footage of you that night,\u201d \u201cYour shoe prints were at the crime scene,\u201d \u201cCell phone records prove you were there,\u201d \u201cYou failed the polygraph,\u201d \u201cYour DNA was on the victim,\u201d and \u201cYour friend said she wasn\u2019t with you like you said\u201d are some all-too-common but real examples. [time-brightcove not-tgx=\u201dtrue\u201d] In Frazier v. Cupp (1969), the Supreme Court made it lawful for the police to present false evidence. Despite enormous amounts of research and thousands of wrongful convictions since that time, the Court has not revisited this issue. That is why lawmakers must step in to rectify the situation. There is almost no limit to the type of deception permitted\u2014one lie or many; small lies and big. Whether aimed at anxious children or adults, the effects can be devastating. In one case, in 1973, a Conn. police sergeant accused 18-year-old Peter Reilly of killing his mother. No witnesses or physical evidence implicated Reilly, who had no history of violence. Yet after hours of interrogation and denials, the sergeant told Reilly that he failed a polygraph exam. Eventually, this disorienting result led Reilly to question his own innocence. \u201cThis test is giving me doubts right now,\u201d he conceded. Led to believe that he blocked the event from consciousness, Reilly later said \u201cWell, it really looks like I did it.\u201d Later still, he confessed to slashing his mother\u2019s throat with a razor. After Reilly was convicted, and spent time in prison, the prosecutor discovered exculpatory evidence in his case file and all charges were dismissed. In a second case, 20 years later, 41-year-old Gary Gauger woke up on the family farm in Ill. and found his parents stabbed to death. Detectives said they found blood-soaked clothes in his bedroom and a bloody knife in his pocket\u2014both lies. They also falsely claimed that he failed a polygraph. Gauger broke down and concluded that he must have killed his parents during an alcohol-induced blackout. After five years in prison, including time spent on death row, he was released; two motorcycle gang members were later convicted of the murders. This type of deception continues unabated to this day. In 2014, 22-year-old Malthe Thomsen, born in Denmark, traveled to New York City for a teaching internship at a preschool. Based on an allegation from an unreliable source, a sex crimes detective interrogated him for hours and told him that surveillance videos showed him touching children in sexual ways. No such footage existed. A confused Thomsen signed a confession and then went on camera: \u201cThis morning,\u201d he said, \u201c I had a rude awakening.\u201d Thomsen was arrested, charged, vilified in local newspapers, and sent to Rikers Island before prosecutors dismissed all charges. (Five years later, Thomsen died of a blood clot in his heart.) I could spend hours detailing the damage caused by this ruse\u2014not only to innocent people wrongfully incarcerated because they were duped into confession, but to future victims of the actual perpetrators of those crimes who escaped prosecution only later to reoffend. Read More: The U.S. Prison System Doesn\u2019t Value True Justice Within the scientific community, proof of the risk posed by the false evidence ploy is beyond dispute. Basic psychology research in a multitude of venues shows that misinformation can alter people\u2019s visual perceptions, beliefs, emotions, physiological states, memories, and the decisions they make. Across the board, these effects are found in adults; they are even greater in children. Recent experiments specifically replicate the effect on confessions. In 2021, Ill. and Ore. passed laws that ban police from lying to children and adolescents brought in for interrogation. In 2022, similar bills were passed by state legislatures in Calif., Utah, and Del. Coming up in 2023, Colo. will present a bill specifically aimed to protect youthful suspects. These developments represent a significant first step in the right direction. Yet more reform is still necessary. Conn. and N.Y. are poised to consider more inclusive bills that would similarly protect adults. Still other states have also begun to study the issue. Hopefully, all remaining states, the District of Columbia, and federal law enforcement agencies will follow, prompting much needed changes to interrogation training and practice nationwide. At this point, you may think that passing a law to prevent police from lying to suspects about evidence is a no brainer. Yet these efforts have met with stiff resistance. Last spring, I testified in Colo, on behalf of a bill that would have banned lying to youthful suspects\u2014or, to put it bluntly, children (ultimately, this bill failed to pass). Before it was my turn, I watched a parade of law enforcement opposition witnesses. Essentially, they argued that the sky would fall, that they could not solve crimes without the tools of deception. One witness said, \u201cJuveniles are afforded an extreme amount of protections\u201d (he was referring to Miranda and the presence of a parent, neither of which has proved protective of innocent kids, lying or not). A second witness countered sarcastically with an alternative proposal, \u201cI\u2019m wondering if we should come up with a bill that it\u2019s illegal to lie to the police.\u201d A third witness put it this way: \u201cPublic safety has got to be paramount, it\u2019s got to be first.\u201d This latter criticism was later echoed by a state senator, formerly a sheriff, who referred to the bill as \u201cpro-criminal\u201d and \u201canti-public safety.\u201d Let me address this public safety argument head on. In 2020, criminologist Robert Norris and others examined 109 wrongful convictions in which the DNA also went on to identify the actual perpetrator. In 94% of these cases, those perpetrators who had escaped arrest and prosecution went on to commit 337 additional offenses, including numerous murders and rapes. When police and prosecutors close a case on an innocent person, the real perpetrator remains free on the street, locked, loaded, and poised to reoffend. One might think that the positions expressed by these witnesses represents the law enforcement position\u2014as if there is only one. Not so. In fact, there are alternative views shared by some of the most experienced interviewers from criminal justice, national security, and military settings who support the proposed ban. What follows is a remarkable group of investigators with experiences in the U.S. Navy, the U.S. Air Force, the United Kingdom, Tempe, Ariz. Chicago, Ill. Morristown, N.J., and Washington D.C. Consider these highly informed practitioners, aligned with the science, in their own words. Mark Fallon: \u201cI spent more than three decades as a national security professional, primarily as a special agent with NCIS. I have conducted interrogations in the United States and internationally, including during military operations. I also chaired the Research Committee of the High Value Detainee Interrogation Group (a three- agency entity of the FBI, CIA, and DoD). There are far too many confession-driven practices that exploit weaknesses and lack dignity. Police should be banned from lying to suspects during interrogation. False confessions continue to result in wrongful convictions. Trust must be restored between police and the public served.\u201d Stuart Greer: \u201cI have been a police officer for 25 years. As a detective and investigative supervisor in northern N.J., I used deception to obtain confessions from subjects I believed were guilty. I knew it was permissible, I thought it was effective, and I saw it as a means to a justifiable end. I now believe I was wrong. Deception can lead vulnerable people to confess to crimes they did not commit. We must now accept that change is needed. Non-coercive information-gathering techniques that are effective, humane, and used by police around the world should be adopted here in the United States. Anything else is just unacceptable.\u201d Andy Griffiths: \u201cI was a senior investigating officer with the U.K. police and obtained my PhD examining real-life murder and rape interviews. The U.K. banned deception and other coercive tactics during my police service, and I saw the positive effects of that change directly. When lying was banned, thereby removing the opportunity to \u2018invent\u2019 evidence, forensic evidence was more widely used, training improved, and, gradually, coerced false confessions ceased. A ban on lying to suspects is a significant step forward in criminal justice and law enforcement.\u201d Matt Jones: \u201cI am a retired homicide detective from Tempe, Ariz. and founder of Evocavi LLC, a company that trains city, state, federal, and corporate security investigators in science-based interview techniques. The investigator who lies about evidence loses credibility, risks false confessions, and undermines the appearance of fairness in court. To my fellow brothers and sisters in law enforcement: you do not need to lie to get confessions. To the interview training companies in the U.S. that still promote deception: it\u2019s time to move on. To prosecutors: police will follow your lead if you would have the courage to advise them accordingly.\u201d Steven Kleinman: \u201cI am a retired Colonel with the U.S. Air Force. Having interrogated foreign military officers, terrorists, and violent extremists, I have learned that the Truth is something to be leveraged not concealed. Engaging with a subject in a forthright manner elicits key information disclosures. Diligent investigative work and skilled interviewing will reliably uncover the facts even in complex cases without diluting the public\u2019s trust. In contrast, misleading individuals as to the nature and/or extent of the evidence increases the incidence of false confessions, an insidious phenomenon that continues to plague this nation.\u201d David Thompson: \u201cI am President of Wicklander-Zulawski & Associates, Inc., a law enforcement consulting and training organization based in Chicago. Our objective is to ensure that investigators use evidence-based practical tools. When a credible authority figure lies to a suspect about evidence, those lies can produce contaminated statements from the guilty party and false confessions from the innocent. The risks are even greater with youthful suspects. Trust is essential to police-community relations and public safety. The use of deceptive tactics undermine these relationships.\u201d James Trainum: \u201cDuring my 17 years as a homicide detective for the D.C. Metro Police and thirteen years as a police practices expert, I reviewed hundreds of interrogations that resulted in false confessions. In every one, investigators misrepresented the evidence. Because of this tactic, innocent people spend decades in prison, otherwise good cases are derailed, and still others go unsolved. Lying to suspects also erodes the public\u2019s trust in law enforcement. Its use is also unnecessary because alternative techniques can be used that elicit more information\u2014and more reliable confessions.\u201d",

At the moment, XRP is striving to hold above the $0.35 level, exchanging hands at $0.35334 on the Bitstamp crypto exchange. window.coinzilla_display = window.coinzilla_display || []; var c_display_preferences = {}; c_display_preferences.zone = \"5335d7792eb489ae565\"; c_display_preferences.width = \"300\"; c_display_preferences.height = \"250\"; coinzilla_display.push(c_display_preferences); Ads window.coinzilla_display = window.coinzilla_display || []; var c_display_preferences = {}; c_display_preferences.zone = \"5335d7792eb489ae565\"; c_display_preferences.width = \"300\"; c_display_preferences.height = \"250\"; coinzilla_display.push(c_display_preferences); Ads \ud83d\udea8 \ud83d\udea8 \ud83d\udea8 \ud83d\udea8 \ud83d\udea8 \ud83d\udea8 \ud83d\udea8 \ud83d\udea8 \ud83d\udea8 267,413,843 #XRP (97,775,558 USD) transferred from unknown wallet to unknown wallet https://t.co/1O0zGB4SAR \u2014 Whale Alert (@whale_alert) December 16, 2022 Related Cardano Founder Is Done with XRP Cardano founder distances himself from XRP As covered by U.Today earlier, founder of Input Output Global, the company which built Cardano, Charles Hoskinson, stated in a recent video on YouTube that from now on he will not be taking part in any discussions related to Ripple or the XRP token affiliated with it. Nor will he answer any questions on those or share his opinions about them. It happened after the XRP army started harassing him and accusing him of lying after December 15. This is the date, which he mentioned in a recent AMA, stating that he had heard rumors about the Ripple-SEC lawsuit to be resolved on that day. This was not the first time the XRP army began trolling Hoskinson and abusing him. This fall he already stated once that he does not want to be involved in any Ripple or XRP discussions. Now, he has distanced himself from that once again.",

    "content": "The crypto space is again bleeding, now with the fresh FUD over the world\u2019s largest exchange Binance. Meanwhile, Bitcoin price is displaying some strength, as Ethereum price has slid down slightly. However, the spotlight was on Binance Coin(BNB) which slumped hard by nearly 20% since the early trading hours. However, the circulating Binance FUD is expected to be the final event that shook the entire crypto space. A , believes that the crypto markets could have been at the last phase of the cycle where-in the trader\u2019s loose focus on buying altcoins. Moreover, the shift of focus would be back to the top 2 cryptos, Bitcoin & Ethereum. This may further ignite a fresh BTC price rally which will be followed by the ETH price. Analyzing the Bitcoin chart, the analyst says that the price may drop to the lower support of around $10,000. Coming to Ethereum the analyst believes the lower support could be around $1000. Moving on to BinanceCoin, he says the BNB price at $190 to $250 is like what the BTC price was during 2018 at around $6000, and breaking these levels could be the final capitulation phase. Lastly, referring to Dogecoin, the analyst finds it as the cleanest chart within the crypto space and believes, DOGE has the potential to revolutionize the micro-payments.",

    "description": "In a year when antisemitism made headlines, American Jews are approaching a public celebration of faith with both fear and defiance",
    "content": "For Jeff Cohen, president of Congregation Beth Israel in Colleyville, Texas, his sense of safety as a Jewish person in America was rocked on Jan. 15 when he and three other members of his congregation were held hostage at their synagogue by a gunman for eleven hours. All the hostages survived the attack, which the FBI went on to investigate as a hate crime and an act of terrorism, but nearly a year later, Cohen says he still feels its impact. Cohen\u2019s experience was perhaps the most high-profile moment in a surge of attacks targeting American Jews. In 2021, a total of 2,717 antisemitic incidents of assault, harassment, and vandalism were reported to the Anti-Defamation League, a Jewish civil-rights advocacy organization. That number, representing a jump of more than 34% from the previous year, was the highest since the organization began tallying such attacks more than 40 years ago. And while 2022\u2019s numbers have not yet been released, antisemitism made headlines this year as rapper Kanye West, now known as Ye, began a social media spree of antisemitic slurs and when former President Donald Trump dined with Ye and a vocal Holocaust denier. [time-brightcove not-tgx=\u201dtrue\u201d] Read more: Adidas\u2019 Dark History Is in the Spotlight as It Ends Deal With Kanye West Over His Antisemitic Comments Now, with Hanukkah beginning on Sunday evening, congregations around the country are getting ready to celebrate what is\u2014though not the most sacred\u2014the most visible Jewish holiday in American pop culture. Celebrants often mark the eight nights (which run from Dec. 18 to 26 this year) by placing a lit menorah in a window of the home, a public declaration of the miracle of the holiday. But at a time when some are fearful to express their faith so openly, doing so can carry a different weight. \u201cThere are people who are nervous,\u201d Cohen says, of Hanukkah plans in his community. \u201cThere are people who would have previously gone and done things in a public space, who now won\u2019t.\u201d It\u2019s a feeling familiar to Rabbi Elliott Tepperman of Bnai Keshet Reconstructionist Synagogue in Montclair, N.J. His community was struck with panic in November when FBI officials warned synagogues across New Jersey that there was \u201ccredible information of a broad threat.\u201d Synagogues throughout the state went into lockdown and law enforcement increased patrolling in predominantly Jewish areas until the threat cleared. An 18-year-old was arrested for disseminating the threats over social media, along with a screed sermonizing violence against Jewish people. \u201cThe Jewish community still carries historical trauma in our bodies and in our cultural institutions,\u201d says Rabbi Elliott Tepperman of Bnai Keshet Reconstructionist Synagogue in Montclair, N.J. \u201cSo when there is a rise in antisemitism, it\u2019s often the case that we are both reacting to whatever the most current incident is, and to everything that has come before.\u201d Read more: Modern Hanukkah Traditions Are A Reminder That Extremism Is Always Short-Lived Dealing with a specific, credible, local threat is a \u201cremarkably different\u201d experience from reading national figures about rising antisemitism in the abstract, he says. Even so, he\u2019s encouraging his congregation to celebrate the coming holiday with full force. \u201cThe most valuable thing we can do to combat antisemitism is to continue to practice and build a vibrant Jewish community,\u201d he says. Tepperman says his synagogue has installed a giant rainbow-colored menorah on their front lawn, and the group plans to have singing and festivities each night of Hanukkah. They\u2019ve invited the mayor and members of the town council to join them. \u201cWe want to give them the opportunity to stand in solidarity with us at a moment when we might be feeling a little bit extra anxious,\u201d he says. Read more: Inside the Biden Administration\u2019s Response to the Spike in Anti-Semitic Attacks The rabbi says that \u201cit was extraordinarily moving\u201d when four congregations of other faiths came to support the Jewish community in Montclair last month after the threats cleared, carrying signs that preached love and solidarity. \u201cWhether this month they\u2019re attacking immigrants or they\u2019re attacking people based on the color of their skin, or they\u2019re attacking LGBT folks, or they\u2019re attacking women, or they\u2019re attacking Jews, we all know that we are going to be in the habit of standing together,\u201d Tepperman says. Cohen sees that defiant spirit in action in Texas, too. While some people are understandably nervous, others have reacted to the frightening experience by feeling emboldened to take even greater public pride in their heritage. \u201cI know a couple of people who always wear a yarmulke now,\u201d Cohen says. Cohen believes that to combat antisemitism, people need to stand up against harmful antisemitic tropes\u2014that no matter the time of year, anyone who hears such stereotypes or conspiracy theories should react strongly. With hate playing such a prominent role in our culture, he points out, it\u2019s crucial to remind people, especially young people, that antisemitism is not acceptable. \u201cIf we hear something like that, we don\u2019t believe it, but we roll our eyes or we look away,\u201d he says. \u201cWe can\u2019t do that anymore.\u201d",

    "description": "TIME spoke to Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen about how simulated social networks could lead to a better future.",
    "content": "(To receive weekly emails of conversations with the world\u2019s top CEOs and business decisionmakers, click here.) Frances Haugen became known around the world in 2021 as the whistleblower who disclosed tens of thousands of pages of internal Facebook documents revealing what the company knew about issues ranging from how its platforms were harming teenagers\u2019 mental health to how they allowed the spread of misinformation. Now she has her sights trained on equipping the next generation of tech leaders with tools to make the world a better place. [time-brightcove not-tgx=\u201dtrue\u201d] In the year since Haugen blew the whistle about the company, which has since rebranded as Meta, discourse surrounding Big Tech has been increasingly dominated by scrutiny over the ways in which some of the most significant technological advances of the past two decades are harming vulnerable communities, stoking division and weakening democracy. Read More: Inside Frances Haugen\u2019s Decision to Take on Facebook Now, social media\u2019s biggest players are facing growing calls for both accountability and regulatory action\u2014a reckoning that\u2019s focused on how to blunt the effects of harmful platforms and products after they\u2019re built. But what if the engineers and developers behind those innovations had reflected on potential harms at the ideas stage rather than working backward to address concerns after the fact? What if those technologies were never engineered in the first place? These are the types of questions that Haugen is working to bring into the classroom as part of not only engineering curriculum, but broader education. As new technologies change almost every facet of modern life, Haugen is developing simulated social networks that could help strengthen students\u2019 ability to recognize ethical and professional responsibilities and make informed judgments. \u201cIf we had a simulated social network, we could teach classes where we actually put students in [different professionals\u2019] shoes,\u201d Haugen tells TIME. \u201cWe could teach a more quantitative version where students have to pull the data out themselves and analyze it. And we could teach a less quantitative one that\u2019s more about analytical thinking to political science majors where they would still learn about the decision-making process of weighing trade-offs, but they wouldn\u2019t have to pull the data themselves. There\u2019s a real opportunity to bring a wide diversity of people to the table.\u201d Read More: How Facebook Forced a Reckoning by Shutting Down the Team That Put People Ahead of Profits TIME spoke with Haugen about the evolution of engineering education, the idea of \u201cdesign refusal,\u201d and how simulated social networks could lead to a better future. This interview has been condensed and edited for clarity. You\u2019ve spoken about developing simulated social networks that would allow educators to train the next generation of social media entrepreneurs and content moderators. What would that accomplish? [My team] and I are in the middle of founding a nonprofit that\u2019s focused on the idea of how we got here. If we\u2019re going to identify the root cause of the \u201cproblem of social media,\u201d it\u2019s not flaws in people and it\u2019s not malicious actors. It\u2019s that not enough people were sitting at the table. It\u2019s that we had these systems that were substantially more opaque than previous technologies of similar power. And that meant that there was never a parallel evolution of an oversight function in society. When we talk about things like cars, we\u2019ve always been able to take cars apart. It took a long time to prove that lead gasoline was a problem, but we could do that without the involvement of the oil companies, for example. In the case of social media, because all we can see is our own feeds, when people see problems, they have no way of knowing how representative those are. And the platforms actively took advantage of the fact that they had that opacity and it shielded them. So we\u2019re focused on this idea of how do you bring, say, a million meaningfully informed people to the table. And they don\u2019t all have to have the same skills. In any other similarly powerful industry, you have an ecosystem of accountability that grows up around that industry. So you have litigators who understand what a cut corner looks like and who hold people accountable. You have investors who understand what long-term success looks like. You have legislative aides who understand what\u2019s feasible. You have informed citizens, like Mothers Against Drunk Driving, who keep safety and the public good at the forefront of attention. When it comes to social media, all those things are missing. So one of the tools that we think is important to add to the pedagogical wheelhouse is a simulated social network. And that has a couple of different motivations. The first is that if we had a simulated social network, we\u2019d be able to teach certain kinds of classes that are non-existent today. We think about social networks in a very ahistorical kind of way. Like when I talk about the Facebook of 2008, it was a profoundly different product from the Facebook of 2018, which was a profoundly different product from the Facebook of today. And we don\u2019t teach classes on the differences between the different iterations of a product. Read More: This App Could Fix Your Social Media Addiction A second motivation is that the way we teach how to think about industrial scale AI systems is fundamentally flawed. We teach data science. We teach the process of being analytical about these systems using problems where we presume there are answers to be found. When we talk about industrial machine learning, we stop having clean answers. When I\u2019m comparing version six and version seven of this industrial machine learning system, it\u2019s to say, is it better? The thing is, to answer that question you have to add, for whom is it better? There\u2019s going to be 20-30 stakeholders and some of those stakeholders are going to benefit and some are going to pay costs and you\u2019re still going to have to decide, do you [produce the product]? And that\u2019s going to happen over and over and over again every single change. Right now, we don\u2019t teach people to think that way until they show up at Facebook or Google or one of the other big industrial machine learning places. If we had a simulated social network, we could teach classes where we actually put students in those shoes. Can you give an example of how one of these lessons might play out in the classroom? So let\u2019s imagine coming to class and you\u2019re asked a question like, should you have to click on a link before you reshare it? It sounds like a really obvious win. Across the board, experiments at Twitter, Facebook, wherever have shown that if you say, \u201cHey, you have to click on a link before you reshare it,\u201d or you at least prompt someone with a link before they reshare it, you spread less misinformation. In the case of Facebook, if you require people to click on a link before they reshare it, it\u2019s 10-15% less misinformation. But Twitter went ahead and did it. And Facebook didn\u2019t. So there must be something more there that we\u2019re missing. In either case, one of the trade-offs is you will have less content circulating on your system, people will spend less time on your system and you won\u2019t make as much money from ads. So if you end up doing anything that causes a little bit more friction on reshares you\u2019re going to see substantially less content being circulated. So imagine a class where we showed up and you played the new user team and I played the ads team and someone else played the non-English-speaking user team and someone else played the children team and we all got to look at the data and say I\u2019m an advocate for my team and I\u2019m going to say ship or don\u2019t ship and we\u2019re gonna have to negotiate together. What\u2019s crazy is, people don\u2019t tell college students this, but if you\u2019re a data scientist, at least 40% of your job, maybe 50% of your job, is going to be communication and negotiations. So with those kinds of classes, they\u2019re participatory. And in the end, you get to develop those thought patterns. Read More: Inside Facebook\u2019s African Sweatshop In fall 2019, a student-led public interest technology project team at Olin College, your alma mater, pioneered the term \u201cdesign refusal.\u201d Do you view this concept of deciding not to undertake projects or build technologies that may cause harm to the public as a growing force in engineering education? The thing to keep in mind when we talk about \u201cengineering education\u201d is it\u2019s really diverse. There are programs that are running 20 years behind even the median. So to categorize engineering education is really hard. But if you look across some of the more progressive programs, at the Ivys, for example, they\u2019re starting to do more on integrating ethics education into everyday lessons and teaching about different needs of different groups and considering all these things. So on the leading edge of people who are asking, \u201chow should we educate engineering leaders in a world where we know there are consequences to technology,\u201d there\u2019s definitely way more conversation now than there was 10 years ago. Design refusal is almost intrinsically about trade-offs. It\u2019s about the idea that you as an individual might sacrifice for the greater good. And not all programs have the same level of acknowledgement of the fact that engineers exist in society; they do not exist separately from society. So that\u2019s difficult to contextualize. What kind of reckoning is possible in the tech industry if these kinds of shifts in thinking continue to gain steam? One thing I\u2019m always telling students is we\u2019re not asking them to be destitute. We\u2019re asking them to be 10% less lucrative, or to expose themselves to a little bit more ambiguity on the path to being more lucrative. You can do lots and lots of wonderful things with technology and make lots and lots of money without stepping on landmines. But you have to do it intentionally. And I think that idea appeals a lot to Gen Z, because they\u2019ve lived with much worse consequences of technology than, say, millennials did. When I was in college, there weren\u2019t really students that were agonizing over the fact that they had gotten engineering degrees. Students weren\u2019t saying things like, \u201cI just got an engineering degree and I don\u2019t know if I can use it.\u201d Things like design refusal help people feel less powerless. When you categorize things as binary, as either good or bad, in some ways, you strip power from individuals. It\u2019s much more constructive to come in and say, \u201cHey, let\u2019s talk about how you can remain a moral agent now that you\u2019ve been given more power.\u201d That\u2019s a really positive thing. Even at the level of individual happiness, it empowers people. We are entering a new era where we have to, as a civilization, think about what our relationship is with technology. One of the top things I talk about is the idea that every year, a larger share of our economy is going to be run by opaque systems. As we move to having more of the important bits be on server farms, be on chips that are opaque, be in blackbox AI systems, the only people who are going to understand how those systems work are the individuals inside the companies. And it may be that part of the governance institutions that we have to develop as a civilization to live with those new technologies is actually educating individuals who work at those companies on what their obligations are to society.",

Sam Bankman-Fried is expected to surrender to U.S. extradition laws as authorities prosecute the former FTX crypto exchange founder for fraud and money laundering. Bankman-Fried will appear before a Bahamas court later on Monday to reverse his earlier decision, per reports from three media outlets. Bahamas authorities arrested SBF on December 12 following a formal request from the Southern District of New York (SDNY) prosecutors. Sam Bankman-Fried appeared before a judge and contested extradition to the United States where he faces several allegations of fraud and money laundering. SBF\u2019s $250,000 bail request was also denied, EthereumWorldNews reported. Reports from CNBC, Reuters, and the Washington Post cited sources close to Bankman-Fried who claimed that the fallen founder no longer planned to fight extradition to the U.S. Bahamas Fox Hill prison staff were also cited as sources. As previously reported, SBF\u2019s extradition hearing will take place on February 8, 2023, barring any changes. Sam Bankman-Fried could remain in Bahamas custody until then, in a prison that many describe as harsh and unforgiving. Sam Bankman-Fried Leaving The Bahamas Court In Custody (Source: CNBC) DOJ Filed Eight (8) Charges Against Sam Bankman-Fried Indeed, the former FTX CEO was charged on eight counts including fraud on customers, lenders, and investors.

Things to get grimmer? In what has now become the longest crypto bear market, albeit in bitcoin\u2019s brief 14-year history, the question is: How much longer can it last? If we look at the economic environment, things look grim, and it could very likely be argued that things are going to get a huge amount grimmer, as the Federal Reserve continues on its path of rate increases, and economies around the world are beginning to scream. The rate hikes are sucking liquidity out of the markets and it's becoming increasingly difficult for investors to know where they can put their wealth where it\u2019s not going to decrease in a dramatic fashion. Crypto is high risk Given that crypto is considered by the market a high risk asset, many investors have already been shaken out and have sold at a loss. Those thinking to buy a dip have had to think again, and again, as prices continue to remain depressed. The total crypto market cap is sat on the support provided by the 2017/18 bull market top at around $760 billion. A bad drop from here could take the entire market down to nearly half this value at $400 billion. Bitcoin the relative safe harbour Bitcoin is as always the only relatively safe crypto asset in this environment. Even ethereum is breaking down against bitcoin and this is leading to bitcoin making higher highs in the dominance chart. Many accusations are levelled at cryptocurrencies in general, particularly at their perceived intrinsic value, and for many cryptocurrencies, this is probably true, at least up to now. However, for those looking to take their wealth out of what could become a terrifyingly unstable fiat financial system, bitcoin might not be such a bad bet. Many of those wishing to sell, or having to sell, would probably have done so by now, and those investors that are left are holding on tight, waiting for that moment when it dawns on the market that a digital asset outside of the monetary system that can\u2019t be controlled by governments, might be a very attractive place to be. The downside for bitcoin has to be reasonably limited. A price under $10,000 isn\u2019t out of the question, but that isn\u2019t such a huge drop from here.

Bitcoin price which was trading within a bullish trend during the past week has scrambled down with a deep bearish trend soon. The technicals also flash bearish signals and due to this, the BTC price appears to shed some of its gains very soon. In the meantime, the prevailing descending trend is believed to set a trigger for a massive uptrend soon. However, before the price begins with a notable upswing, a minor plunge is expected to drag the price below $16,500 which may ignite a significant upswing soon. As per a popular analyst, the BTC price is believed to be a significant bull run, by the end of Q1 2023. Source: Tradingview In the short term, the BTC price had risen above the bearish descending triangle, displaying the possibility of igniting a notable upswing soon. As per the current forecast, the BTC price is believed to ignite a notable upswing and maintain an ascending trend for the next 6 months. The analyst also believes that the upcoming 45 days may witness extreme consolidation for the token and the entire crypto space. Further by the end of January 2023 or early February, a breakthrough impulse may occur which may keep up a bullish trend until the mid of May 2023 which may rise the Bitcoin (BTC) price close to $45,000. At the same time, the analyst also believes that the altcoins may also shoot up which is pivotal to setting up a bullish trend within the crypto space that may attract strong hands back into the space.",

Sure, there were still some 135,000 new cases on Thursday in the United States, but that\u2019s way off from the million-plus cases seen last January. This was, to be clear, a good development. Treating every discussion around a global pandemic that has infected more than 650 million people and killed almost 6.7 million as some sort of binary political test was\u2014and is\u2014a maddening approach to a crisis. Yet there are those who are all too happy to view the pandemic as a useful weapon in scoring points, a detour away from responsible conduct and into the circus tent of politics. Screaming as loud as you can doesn\u2019t make your denial of Covid\u2019s threat any less of one. Like I said, there was a moment when the carnival organ grinded to a stop, notably when the Republican primaries of this year ended. The silence, however, proved short-lived. Its pipes are back screaming, right as the opening days of the 2024 contest appear to have arrived. Newly crowned Twitter owner Elon Musk last week sent his own rocket of a troll on his new toy: \u201cMy pronouns are Prosecute/Fauci.\u201d It was a double-barreled ding against both the nation\u2019s top immunologist, and the inclusive approach of allowing individuals to choose their own gendered or gender-neutral pronouns. Musk, who is testing just how elastic Twitter can be in accommodating political stances, drew the predictable outrage and reward\u2014a cycle some politicians already know well. Then there was the recent decision by Congress, or more specifically Senate Democrats, to trade away a mandate on vaccines for U.S. military members in exchange for the must-pass defense bill. Even though Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin supported the mandates, it was just one of those things that fell aside in the chase for the big-picture spending. (A companion effort to reinstate discharged service members, however, did not get support.) Defending the Biden administration\u2019s mandate was unlikely to win Democrats many friends, especially when it meant potentially sacrificing a pay raise for the troops. There are no wins in denying men and women serving in uniform their due, especially at the holidays. Cynicism, however, always wins. Consider Gov. Ron DeSantis, for example. Just over a year ago, the leader of the aging state of Florida leaned heavily into vaccines. He urged his residents to get the jab, praised vaccines for saving lives, and scrambled to understand the impact of a pandemic on a state with a heavy reliance on tourism. But then, he looked around at the political landscape facing his 2022 re-election and potential 2024 presidential bid, and pulled a full 180: he banned mask and vaccine mandates, trashed Fauci at every turn he could find, and wouldn\u2019t even say if he got his booster shot. He barreled ahead with plans to reopen Florida before the pandemic had even hit its nadir. Last week, while convening anti-vaxxers for a chat\u2014and preparing for his next act in politics\u2014DeSantis suggested his state\u2019s supreme court should impanel a grand jury to investigate pharmaceutical companies\u2019 transparency in vaccines. The ultimate practitioner of such savvy amplification of Covid-19\u2019s political juice remains former\u2014and perhaps future\u2014President Donald Trump. His return to power hinges on DeSantis\u2019 potential to chase and catch him. After all, it was only a year ago that Trump drew boos when he told an otherwise friendly crowd that he had received his vaccine booster. And to the chagrin of much of his base, he never fired Fauci (even though he couldn\u2019t really do it). Trump is, for the true anti-vaxxers, an unreliable partner when it comes to fighting the Establishment\u2019s faith in science. Both men\u2019s supporters are looking at their positions on vaccines as an early barometer for success. For Trump, his role in developing Operation Warp Speed is seen as evidence that he helped beat back the virus\u2019 hellscape\u2014even though he wrongly says the vaccine rollout was delayed until after the election for political hackery. For DeSantis, his steady evolution into an anti-vaxxer\u2014or at least someone who seems palatable for true anti-vaxxers\u2014is a way to creep onto turf long assumed to be safely in the MAGA column. So, even as Covid\u2019s threat seems to be fading, it is surely going to have VIP access to the coming GOP primary calendars. The contest, however, may end up coming down to who has the louder megaphone, and Covid amounts to an easy primal scream. The decibel-level-as-proxy-for-fact strategy is one that seldom serves voters well and often drives the conversation into a ditch of regret. This sort of performative protest is nothing new, and it can read as tired after a while. There are real costs to this conduct, though. Red states have borne the brunt of Covid-19, with states that backed Trump posting the absolute lowest rates of immunization. Being a \u201cvaccine skeptic,\u201d as some prefer to be known, is fashionable in some circles. That status, new research tells us, can also be deadly: the redder a locale, the more likely it was a high-mortality place for Covid-19 and other ailments. Judging by how some thought leaders are positioning themselves, it\u2019s a point of pride to keep hospitals and funeral homes alike packed with avoidable troubles. And some of the biggest self-described proponents of besting science with trolling are preparing their next shouts. The quiet, it seems, is over. Make sense of what matters in Washington.

    "content": "The post Oryen Network On The Brink Of Revolutionizing DeFi, ORY Presale Outselling Shiba Inu And Dogecoin appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News To make a bold move on the path to a revolution in DeFi, a crypto project would have to take monumental leaps to deliver real benefits that meet expectations. A particular project has been making significant efforts to redefine decentralized finance by offering the ultimate ease of use while interacting with automated features. Oryen is on the brink of revolutionizing DeFi as its ongoing presale achieved an incredible price increase of 400% and outsells Shiba Inu and Dogecoin. Oryen (ORY) \u2013 The Protocol For The Future Oryen sets itself apart from the lot by repurposing the narrowed view of decentralized finance through its one-of-a-kind financial protocol called Oryen Autostaking Technic or OAT. The purpose of the protocol is to ensure that staking processes are made easy and convenient for investors to implement and consequently earn through its native token, ORY, the highest stable returns in crypto. A unique benefit of the ORY token is that automatic staking and compounding features are operational to reward holders with the highest fixed APY (Annual Percentage Yield) in the market at a rate of 90% and a daily ROI (Return On Investment) of 0.177%. The OAT protocol ensures a safe and easy means to perform autostaking in DeFi. Basically, when you buy ORY, you receive autostaking directly to your wallet and you are set to receive rebase rewards. OAT protocol also assures a fast rebase reward by paying out every 60 minutes or 24 times every day, thus making it the fastest auto-staking protocol. According to CryptoNews sources, Oryen is one of the best cryptocurrencies to buy right now. OAT also ensures that all feature implementations are smooth and operational by taking into account a complex set of factors to provide support for its price and rebase rewards. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Shiba Inu is one of the many \u201cdog-themed\u201d meme cryptocurrencies that was developed in August 2020 by an unknown person or group of persons under the pseudonym \u201cRyoshi\u201d. The meme crypto aspires to be the Ethereum-based rival to Dogecoin. SHIB token is an Ethereum-based ERC-20 token that can be exchanged between traders and can be held as a store of value. Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin is the first \u201cmeme-centric\u201d cryptocurrency that was developed as a payment system in 2013. It was created to be a relatable and more digestible digital currency due to the wild speculations surrounding crypto at the time. Dogecoin\u2019s native crypto, DOGE is also a store of value and can be traded against other crypto assets. DOGE\u2019s insignia depicts the popular \u201cdoge meme\u201d and it is also an open-source crypto that facilitates peer-to-peer transactions. Conclusion As Oryen progresses on its path to changing the narrative of decentralized finance, the foreseeable future holds amazing possibilities to ensure the ultimate access to wealth generation.

    "content": "\u201cBe brave when others are fearful.\u201d The wise words of Warren Buffet rings true as the current market conditions for crypto may seem bleak, and investors are afraid of what\u2019s to come. In truth, this may be one of the best opportunities to position yourself in preparation for 2023 and beyond, as the market will recover in due time, especially as blockchain technology is gradually adapted to mainstream businesses. If you\u2019re unsure of which cryptocurrencies to keep a lookout for, here are the top tokens to potentially invest in for 2023. Buy $GLTM Tokens Here Ethereum (ETH) The Ethereum blockchain has always been a favourite amongst most crypto investors. In fact, some experts believe that since the merge and transition into proof-of-work (PoW), Ethereum can potentially overtake Bitcoin as the network becomes more environmentally sustainable while entering a deflationary status. As of time of writing, the price of Ethereum is currently at $1,323.71, which is a far cry away from its ATH at $4,878.26 in 2021, making it a perfect opportunity for an entry. Solana (SOL) Through the blockchain\u2019s unique trustless and fair distribution system, Solana is considered to be both censorship resistant and ideal for daily commerce activities. In fact, Solana\u2019s transactional output is scaled proportionally to its bandwidth, which is currently capable of 50,000 tps (transactions per second). As a comparison, Ethereum can handle about 12 tps, and Bitcoin can handle about 7 tps However, due to the complications of the FTX collapse, it has recently regressed to $13.83. As a silver lining, this is the perfect opportunity for long-term investors to diversify into the Solana blockchain. Golteum (GLTM) Golteum is the first ever protocol to launch gold-backed NFTs. Unlike most crypto projects which are speculative in nature, Golteum provides investors with real life value and utility. The uniqueness of this project is that investors are essentially investing in gold as it has been for thousands of years, however, the process is streamlined through blockchain technology. The team behind Golteum are also highly respectable individuals with backgrounds in gold custodial firms, and have been KYC\u2019d by Certik. Additionally, Golteum has officially teamed up with Fireblocks to support their mission in launching a top-tier trading platform.This includes custody services, treasury management, risk mitigation tools, and their highly anticipated tokenization mechanism for the handling of all gold NFTs. As the protocol provides true value at unparalleled levels in the crypto space, the tokens have skyrocketed in value by 85% since its launch in November 2022, going from $0.07 to $0.13 in the span of a month. As the team plans on further scaling the protocol with a gold-backed NFT marketplace and various other features on the platform, the prices of the tokens will continue to grow in leaps and bounds in conjunction with the progress of the project. Golteum has recently launched their second phase of the token pre-sale, with an additional bonus of 20% discount for new investors, meaning it is the perfect time for long-term investors to enter the ecosystem. The Best of Both Worlds \u2013 Web2 and Web3 Golteum is a protocol which aims to solve the inherent problems faced by the traditional gold market through blockchain technology. Similar to Ethereum and Solana, Golteum offers security and transparency in gold trading while allowing investors to enjoy low-cost and hassle-free transactions.

    "content": "Find out which cryptocurrencies currently rule the market by reading on. The top gainers on December 20, 2022, included XDC, GMX, D2T, FGHT, and TARO. Watching these top performers can help you choose where to invest your hard-earned money in the best way, whether you are an experienced trader or you are just getting started. Examining the causes of the most recent increase in the prices of these particular cryptocurrencies will help us predict what the future may hold. XDC Network (XDC) Hummingbot, a Calif. open-source DeFi business software system, recently launched a 12-week feasibility mining campaign for XDC on well-known crypto exchanges Gate.io and KuCoin. This XDC-based campaign started on Tuesday. For the XDC Network to bring together big communities and provide liquidity, this was a crucial step, naturally helping its price move upwards. The token combinations XDC/USDT and XDC/ETH are supported by this XDC-based campaign as acceptable submissions. Users can take part in this campaign by setting up a fully automated XDC mining bot and adding a KuCoin or Gate.io exchange account. A comprehensive set of instructions has been posted on the XDC Member forum. Due to all these advancements, XDC has more exposure, which has led to more investors becoming part of its ecosystem as a whole. This is most likely what is driving XDC\u2019s price increase and upward trend. The token\u2019s price has increased from $0.021 to $0.025 even over a weekly time frame, which goes the show the strength that the project has been featuring not just today, but in the past couple of days. GMX (GMX) In recent months, the cost of GMX (GMX) has risen, and in December, that trend continued. The coin\u2019s price recently rose to a high of $60, marking its highest level since Oct 5 of this year. From its lowest point this year, GMX has increased by more than 147%. However, there are several reasons behind its significant upward surge. Everything has worked to increase the value of GMX, from positive comments from prominent players in the cryptocurrency industry to the overwhelmingly high level of public interest in decentralized funding (DeFi). Despite the improving optimism in the cryptocurrency market, the recent increases in the GMX currency look to be declining for the day. The cause is still unclear, though. GMX, in contrast, is a platform that is not controlled by a single individual and is decentralized. Additionally, it is an open platform that welcomes user additions. It was built based on Arbitrum as well as Avalanche, which makes its transactions extremely rapid and affordable. The overall TVL in GMX has risen to an all-time peak of around $1 billion, according to statistics acquired by DeFi Llama. Decentralized marketplaces like GMX were quite well-known as a result of the failure of FTX, a significant centralized cryptocurrency exchange. Dash 2 Trade (D2T) A project which has been gaining high demand and may be looking for a further increase in value too, is Dash 2 Trade. It is made to help investors\u00a0deal with cryptocurrency trading options better.\u00a0It also gives consumers a tactical advantage for traversing the cryptocurrency business by offering several technical indicators, enhanced on-chain data, as well as trading strategies. Users will have real-time access to social data, on-chain analytics, as well as presale market data because of their special grading system. Due to the currency\u2019s quick delivery of crucial crypto trading indicators, investors have stayed with it. Due to the high demand for the D2T token during the presale, reputable exchanges are prepared to list it shortly after launch, and they anticipate a sizeable daily volume of trade once the token goes live. The project has a hard cap of $13.4 million as of the date of this writing, of which some $10 million has currently been reached. It is truly admirable that the market has experienced such incredible development. FightOut (FGHT) FightOut is one of the top move-to-earn crypto services that has had tremendous growth since its original announcement. Pre-sale access for its native FGHT currency has begun, and demand has been quite high. The FGHT cryptocurrency is given as a prize to athletes who improve their fitness. Using the platform\u2019s app, they may receive personalized workouts and perform them with in-depth tutorial videos provided by well-known trainers. The workouts are meant to help athletes improve their strength, cardio, endurance, and technique as they get ready for boxing as well as MMA. REPS is given to users or athletes when they complete their workouts. REPS may be used in the FightOut app to pay for goods, private coaching sessions, and more. Additionally, the REPS rewards program hopes to inspire individuals to improve their general fitness. There are soft limitations on how many REPS a user may gain from strength, cardiovascular, endurance, and technical sessions. A person will therefore get the greatest REPS by performing exercises in the following categories: Users of FightOut also get an NFT avatar to help them get fitter. In the FightOut metaverse, this avatar can be utilized to take part in leagues, competitions, and virtual fights. It\u2019s also a great way for the FightOut network to highlight fitness improvements. Since the cryptocurrency presale now offers a 50% incentive for early buyers, demand has risen even higher. RobotEra (TARO) RobotEra wants to provide players with more exciting gameplay mechanics and income prospects than the well-known project Decentraland. In contrast to player-versus-player competitions, RobotEra gives players additional chances to earn prizes as they explore and attempt to fix Taro\u2019s ruin. The local currency in RobotEra is called TARO. Although owners of the crypto money can wager to acquire more units, the token will be used within the game to purchase and sell NFTs. Similar to the other presale ventures listed above, this asset is now up for sale on the website and has been building a sizable community. The token is growing in terms of demand considerably, and may be looking at some massive gains in the upcoming days.

    "content": "The post <strong>Ethereum Price Analysis: What\u2019s in Store for the ETH Price in 2023</strong> appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Ethereum price is trading within a deep bearish trend ever since the second-largest crypto-marked highs just before the end of 2021. Multiple factors contributed to the price plunge which is heading toward the edge of the consolidation. However, the bearish clouds continue to prevail as the ETH price continues to trade below 50-day MA levels for more than a month in the daily chart. In the middle of the bearish clouds circulating around the ETH price, the possibility of a minor upswing emerges. The token is believed to raise finely, as the price is trading with the profit-making zone after holding firmly just above the loss zone. The asset is currently displaying significant strength and hence is believed to rise high after a minor pullback.\u00a0 A popular analyst believes that the ETH price may soon offer a long entry at around $1190. Well, $1,190 would be a good level for longs on $ETH as, then, we get a HL after a HH.Overall, waiting for more confirmation (and got $1,200 as another level too). pic.twitter.com/MPuzUd078D\u2014 Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) December 20, 2022 As per the forecast, the price could further rise high after testing the support at $1190 to reach the level of around $1268 in the next couple of days.\u00a0 Amid the possibility of a minor upswing, the Ethereum price is expected to follow in the footsteps of the star crypto Bitcoin. As reported earlier, the BTC prices may soon experience a death cross in the weekly time frame for the first time ever in history. However, the ETH price which underwent a \u2018Golden Cross\u2019 in the weekly time frame just before the beginning of the 2021 bull run, is all set, to begin with, a fresh trend reversal. Trading view The ETH price after the golden cross ranged high to mark ATH close to $4800. Further, a bearish market slashed the price by more than 75% at the moment and the probable death cross may hinder the rally, postponing the recovery phase indefinitely.\u00a0 Presently, the ETH price is trading within a decisive phase, very close to the peak of the consolidation which may trigger a massive price action. The volume has dropped low, equally dominated by bulls and bears which has hampered the volatility to a large extent.\u00a0 In the coming days, the Ethereum (ETH) price is believed to undertake a massive upswing but only after a brief consolidation. Therefore, the price is required to rise & hold above the current resistance at $1240 to set a bullish trade for 2023.",

    "description": "<p>The British Financial Conduct Authority (<a href=\"https://www.financemagnates.com/tag/fca/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"follow\">FCA</a>) has summarized its regulatory actions in 2022, highlighting the newest three-year strategy, increased number of enforcement actions and the employment of 1,000 new officers to better protect consumers from financial harm.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Responding to its <a href=\"https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/the-fca-announced-a-new-three-year-strategy-digital-assets-are-included/\">strategy published in April</a>, the FCA stepped up its efforts and has removed or changed the content of more than 8,000 potentially misleading advertisements. It also revoked the licenses of 201 firms that failed to meet regulatory standards. </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">In addition, the FCA published 1,800 warnings about potential fraudsters in the financial markets. Thanks to the higher 2022 statistics compared to the year earlier, the FCA managed to recover \u00a330 million belonging to investors and prevented the loss of another \u00a37 million.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\"This has been a difficult year for many people who have been struggling with the cost of living. So it is all the more important that financial companies meet our standards and treat their customers fairly, particularly those who are facing financial difficulties,\" Nikhil Rathi, Chief Executive of the FCA, said.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">The FCA has hired more than 1,000 \"new colleagues,\" opened an office in Leeds and accelerated its expansion in Edinburgh. According to the FCA's statement, these steps were vital to improve 2022 statistics and to continue current work on reforms supporting competitiveness and security in the UK financial market.</p><p>FCA Takes Many Steps to Protect Retail Investors</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Throughout 2022, the financial watchdog has taken many initiatives to reduce financial losses for retail investors. In May, it published a warning related to the <a href=\"https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/regulation/uk-fca-issues-new-reminder-about-the-risks-of-investing-in-cryptos/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"follow\">risks of investing in </a><a href=\"https://www.financemagnates.com/terms/c/cryptocurrencies/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"b091101e-6e02-4b36-aa0e-7c972dfdd6ed_1\" class=\"terms__secondary-term\">cryptocurrencies</a> and the inappropriate promotion of digital assets on social media.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">The topic of rogue financial ads <a href=\"https://www.financemagnates.com/forex/fca-fights-with-rogue-financial-ads-outlines-new-rules/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"follow\">resurfaced in early December</a> when the FCA took steps to combat misleading, fraudulent and illegal <a href=\"https://www.financemagnates.com/terms/m/marketing/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"48d4594c-de24-47ac-9f1b-aa2e0da8374a_1\" class=\"terms__main-term\">marketing</a> activities. In 2022, the number of poorly composed promotional campaigns was four times higher than the year before.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">The regulator also drew attention to \"<a href=\"https://www.financemagnates.com/forex/fca-warns-brokers-against-cfds-poor-practices/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"follow\">poor practices</a>\" among contracts for difference (CFDs) brokers, reminding that CFDs are high-risk assets. As a result, the regulator sent a 'Dear CEO' letter to representatives of trading companies licensed in the UK to draw their attention to paying special attention to the quality of their services.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">The FCA issued a separate warning addressed to developers of mobile trading apps, focusing on the <a href=\"https://www.financemagnates.com/forex/fca-warns-trading-app-operators-to-stop-the-trading-gamification/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"follow\">excessive 'gamification' of retail trading</a>. According to the financial watchdog, it can lead to overtrading and, consequently, to excessive loss.</p> This article was written by Damian Chmiel at www.financemagnates.com.",

It was the first time the British regulator revoked the TPR of a firm \u201cfor missing its landing slot and failing to apply for authorization in a timely manner.\u201d</p><p>The FCA earlier kicked out several other firms operating under this temporary regime for violations of regulations. At the start of this year, the regulator <a href=\"https://www.financemagnates.com/forex/regulation/fca-suspends-four-european-firms-from-operating-under-tpr/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"follow\">suspended four Cypriot firms under the TPR</a> and revoked the permissions of at least two CFDs broker operators, <a href=\"https://www.financemagnates.com/forex/brokers/fca-orders-everfx-to-stop-offering-cfds-to-uk-customers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"follow\">EverFX</a> and <a href=\"https://www.financemagnates.com/forex/brokers/fca-stops-uk-operation-of-cfds-broker-finteractive-limited-fxvc/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"follow\">Finteractive Limited (FXVC)</a>, last year.</p><p>A Temporary but Essential Program</p><p>The FCA introduced the TPR after confirming the United Kingdom\u2019s exit from the European Union. Within the member countries of the European Union, financial services companies can passport their licenses, meaning a licensed firm in any country can operate in any other member state without the authorization of the local regulator. However, this regime changed for the UK after <a href=\"https://www.financemagnates.com/terms/b/brexit/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"0d53a9a8-2500-4d0e-a2bd-41c7ceaf31d1_1\" class=\"terms__secondary-term\">Brexit</a>.</p><p>The TPR aims to allow the EU financial services companies to operate in the United Kingdom until they <a href=\"https://www.financemagnates.com/institutional-forex/regulation/fca-extends-window-for-applying-to-temporary-permissions-regime/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"follow\">receive an FCA authorization</a> for continuing their British operations. However, there are many restrictions, and companies willing to obtain an FCA license can only operate under the program.</p><p>Check out the FMLS21 session on \"The City\u2019s Post-Brexit Future as a Financial Hub.\" </p><p>In parallel to the UK, the EU member states also started TPR programs to allow UK-registered companies to operate in the 27-country bloc with almost similar conditions and restrictions. The Cypriot regulator last year revealed that it <a href=\"https://www.financemagnates.com/forex/regulation/cysec-admits-88-uk-firms-under-temporary-permissions-regime/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"follow\">onboarded 88 UK-based firms under its TPR program</a>.</p><p>\u201cAt the start of the year, we stated our expectations of firms in the TPR and that if they miss their landing slots, or do not apply by 31 December 2022, we expect them to voluntarily cancel their temporary permissions,\u201d the FCA stated.</p><p>\u201cIf this does not happen, then we would take swift action to cancel permissions as the TPR should only be used by firms who want to operate in the UK in the long-term and meet the standards to do so.\u201d</p> This article was written by Arnab Shome at www.financemagnates.com.",

The Radio dodge technology is said to be a reliable and low-cost technology that works with the Starlink internet service. Dogecoin has undergone several technical developments as the team seeks to back it up with real-world use cases beyond its investment use. A recent report has disclosed that Dogecoin transactions have been designed to be sent through radio transmission. In a blog post, Doge developers Mitchie Lumin and Timothy Stabbing mentioned that SpaceX\u2019s Starlink satellite network would be used to facilitate Dogecoin transactions without the internet. This explains why the Radiododge Regional Hub was created. This has been confirmed by a Twitter page identified as \u201cDogeDesigner.\u201d Dogecoin Transactions without internet access? Yes! It will be possible with the project \u201cRadio Doge\u201d which focuses on using Radio tech. combined with Starlink satellite network to enable access for people outside the reach of the internet. The 1st transaction took place in April. It is worth noting that DOGE is not the first crypto to be sent through radio transmission. People have used concepts like \u201cmesh networking, amateur radio equipment, and portable antennas\u201d to get access to Bitcoin transactions without the internet.

It is said to be a \u201d C-based library of Dogecoin protocols\u201d that operates as a building block for Dogecoin projects. According to Michi Lumin, the wider community would be allowed to transact through the radio as they seek to establish a low-cost open-source hardware implementation in the future. For now, the demo has established its potential utility. The Libdogecoin project in addition has plans to create \u201cDogecoin standard documentation, community proof of stake, layer-2 scaling for point of sale, and these radio-enabled nodes.\u201d The Dogecoin transactions were routed from the regional hub dodgecoin testnet using the Starlink satellite. This initiative is in line with the key objective of the asset according to the Dogecoin Foundation. The Foundation explains that they seek to make Doge a de factor worldwide currency as a medium of exchange. The Foundation also disclosed that it is currently working on other projects to prepare the ecosystem for grassroots adoption. They believe that the project could take advantage of the 1.7 billion people unbanked worldwide. The effort has been lauded by the Dogecoin community.

    "description": "\"Who I was before ceased to exist the moment Lexi died,\" Kimberly Mata-Rubio says.",
    "content": "On a drizzly December evening in Washington, D.C., Kimberly Mata-Rubio marched silently from Union Station to Capitol Hill with dozens of other families from Uvalde, Texas. Her 10-year-old daughter Lexi Rubio was murdered in the shooting at Robb Elementary School on May 24. Mata-Rubio had never been on a plane prior to the shooting, but this was now her seventh trip to Washington in as many months to pressure lawmakers to pass restrictions on assault weapons. She carried a sign reading, \u201cAssault weapons took my daughter, Lexi.\u201d When the march ended in front of the Capitol building, Mata-Rubio, 33, was weeping. [time-brightcove not-tgx=\u201dtrue\u201d] This is not the vocation that Mata-Rubio envisioned for herself, but it is now her future. While she\u2019s taking on the legislative battles, she is also navigating her complicated and painful grief. She is mourning the loss of her daughter\u2014but also the loss of the life she and her family had before the shooting. \u201cWho I was before ceased to exist the moment Lexi died,\u201d Mata-Rubio says, sitting on a bench outside the U.S. Capitol on Dec. 8 in between meetings with lawmakers. \u201cThis new me, it\u2019s difficult figuring it out.\u201d Christopher Lee for TIMEA memorial for Lexi in her parents\u2019 home in Uvlade. As mass shootings in the U.S. become increasingly common\u2014there have been more than 400 in the U.S. since the tragedy in Uvalde on May 24, according to the Gun Violence Archive\u2014she says it should be clear that her anguish could become any other parent\u2019s, as well. \u201cI would receive comments, something along the lines of, \u2018I can\u2019t imagine what you\u2019re going through,'\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I\u2019m like, well, no. As a mom or a dad, you can imagine\u2026 Only when you imagine my pain will you join me in fighting.\u201d Christmas Eve marks seven months since Lexi and 18 other children and two teachers were killed by a gunman. Normally, Lexi would help her father, Felix Rubio, decorate the outside of their home for the holidays. They\u2019d drink hot chocolate with marshmallows and watch Christmas movies together. This year, the family decorated Lexi\u2019s gravesite with Christmas lights and giant candy canes. Read More: \u2018There Is an Emptiness.\u2019 Uvalde Shooting Victim Lexi Rubio\u2019s Great-Grandfather Remembers Her 10 Years of Life For decades, no mass shooting produced meaningful changes to gun law on Capitol Hill. Dec. 14 was the 10-year anniversary of a gunman killing 20 children and six adults at the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., an event that many lawmakers and advocates thought would lead to federal changes to gun policy, which never panned out. But Uvalde was different: President Joe Biden in June signed the most significant gun reform bill in nearly three decades into law, which enhances background checks for young gun buyers and funds mental health programs. Christopher Lee for TIMEFelix Rubio, the father of Lexi Rubio, wears a shirt that memorializes his daughter. Still, that law might not have prevented the Uvalde shooter from acquiring his weapon. Mata-Rubio says it isn\u2019t enough. Like many parents of mass shooting victims, she is learning not only that the pain of losing a child doesn\u2019t end, but that those in power are often slow\u2014or even entirely unwilling\u2014to change U.S. gun laws. Mata-Rubio has become a public figure, testifying before Congress, speaking directly with lawmakers, participating in rallies in Austin, and sharing her heartbreak with her nearly 19,000 followers on Twitter to try to spur national change. During her December trip to D.C., she urged the Senate to pass a bill that would reinstate a ban on certain assault weapons like the one used in the Uvalde shooting and others. (The House passed the bill in July.) But it\u2019s unlikely that Senate leadership will bring the bill to a vote before Republicans take control of the House on Jan. 3\u2014all but sinking any possibility of that legislation passing. \u201cIt\u2019s been a rough two weeks,\u201d Mata-Rubio tells TIME in an interview a few days after the march in D.C. She committed to the Washington trip prior to Thanksgiving, but since the holiday, her mourning took a new form. \u201cThose traditions that we usually do, we\u2019re not doing, and [Lexi\u2019s] not here\u2026 Had I been in the headspace I\u2019m in right now, I probably wouldn\u2019t have [decided to come].\u201d Christopher Lee for TIMEKimberly visits Lexi\u2019s gravesite, which they decorated for the holidays. Tied to Uvalde Less than one week after her D.C. trip, Mata-Rubio walked across the stage in a cap and gown at the St. Mary\u2019s University commencement ceremony to receive her Bachelor\u2019s degree in History. She was wearing a necklace with the letter \u201cA.\u201d Lexi\u2019s full name was Alexandria Aniyah Rubio. Her family cheered for her from the audience, and an extra large photo of Lexi filled one of the seats. It was an emotional experience, Mata-Rubio says. She and her husband\u2014a former patrol deputy with the Uvalde County Sheriff\u2019s Office\u2014had wanted to move Lexi and her five siblings out of Texas. Mata-Rubio used to work as a reporter at the Uvalde Leader-News, a local twice-weekly newspaper. But she only had a high school diploma, and in 2019, she decided to quit and get her Bachelor\u2019s degree, which she hoped would help get her a job at the FBI, or open up other opportunities in journalism outside of Texas. \u201cI almost would have taken anything,\u201d she says. \u201cWhatever, just to get my kids out of Uvalde, experience something different. It was important to me.\u201d The family was thinking of moving to Washington State, or some place cold\u2014Lexi liked cold weather. They believed Mata-Rubio\u2019s college degree would be their ticket out. \u201cThat was what we were waiting for to leave,\u201d she says. \u201cSo I was almost right there. Just too late.\u201d Now, Mata-Rubio will never leave Uvalde. \u201cLexi is there,\u201d she says. Christopher Lee for TIMEKimberly and Felix visit Lexi\u2019s gravesite in Uvalde. Honoring Lexi Mata-Rubio first testified about gun violence just three days before Lexi was buried. \u201c[Lexi] was firm, direct, voice unwavering,\u201d Mata-Rubio said in her testimony before the House Oversight Committee, her own voice shaking but forceful. \u201cSo today we stand for Lexi and as her voice we demand action.\u201d Mata-Rubio has already seen more changes enacted since losing her daughter than many other parents of school shooting victims. Her push for strengthened background checks became law in June. Now her focus has turned to passing an assault weapons ban. Mata-Rubio won\u2019t comment on the ongoing investigation into the events that unfolded at Robb Elementary School, but says, \u201cIf 300-plus officers felt outgunned by one person with an assault weapon, then the average citizen shouldn\u2019t have access to that type of weapon.\u201d Read More: How Uvalde Schools Police Chief Pete Arredondo Went From Local Public Servant to National Pariah Christopher Lee for TIMEA closet in Kimberly and Felix\u2019s home where they store many of Lexi\u2019s belongings. Lexi had the pink water bottle with her at school on the day of the shooting. Some of the opposition to the reforms Mata-Rubio wants is coming from her own elected representatives. On Dec. 8, shortly after speaking with TIME, Mata-Rubio and her husband met with a staffer for Sen. John Cornyn, a Republican from Texas. According to Mata-Rubio, the staffer told her the office would not do anything to persuade Senate leadership to bring a bill banning assault weapons to a vote before the end of the year. (Cornyn\u2019s office confirmed the meeting to TIME but declined to comment on what was discussed.) After her trip to Washington, Mata-Rubio returned to Uvalde to figure out what to do next and bear the pain of her first Christmas without Lexi. She wants to return to work at the Leader-News, but her first priority is her activism. With the new Congress next year there will be a renewed fight for gun safety legislation, a new balance of power in Washington, and new lawmakers to confront with her grief. In the meantime, Mata-Rubio and her family visit Lexi\u2019s grave every day. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to get there earlier these days though, because it gets darker sooner,\u201d Mata-Rubio says, \u201cand it\u2019s hard to leave her in the dark.\u201d",

Martinez Aleman, found that female friendships are \u201ca site for assessing meaning of self and of reality, a site for the experience of different perspectives and viewpoints, and an opportunity for growth through interdependency.\u201d And a more recent 2020 study in Feminism and Psychology found that female friendships are \u201ca site of ease, escape and refuge.\u201d Jane Fonda echoed this at a 2015 Sundance Women in Film brunch, sharing that her female friendships helped \u201ckeep the starch in my spine\u201d throughout her long and incredible career in Hollywood, by just being able to \u201chang together and help each other.\u201d Another Harvard study, this one from 2019, found that the most successful women were those with a close inner circle of female friends. This has certainly been my experience. 20 years ago this holiday season, I lost my mom to opioid addiction. I was in my early 20\u2019s, and soon after she died, I would get married, move almost 2,000 miles away from Pittsburgh, Pa. to Park City, Utah, and start my family. The first few years, particularly around the holiday season, without my mom were complicated. Some of her traditions brought me solace like decorating the tree with her and my grandmother\u2019s antique tin ornaments, or making a countdown chain, as she did for me, out of red and green construction paper for my children. But many others left me with overwhelming grief. Even though I was no longer religious, I yearned to sit next to her in the warm glow of midnight mass. Or chat while making pumpkin pies. Or stay up late talking near the lit-up tree. In most ways, I wanted nothing to do with my mother\u2019s traditions. Nothing to do with her. I was angry at the choices she made. Angry, she was gone. Angry, I didn\u2019t know how to save her. And that anger would keep me from the memory of her for many years. Keep me from knowing how to incorporate her back into my everyday life. Keep me from her holiday traditions. But on this morning, after my first cup of coffee, I text Adrienne back. \u201cOk! I\u2019m sufficiently caffeinated. Good morning!\u201d She gives a \u201cHaha,\u201d and then, \u201cWhat do the kiddos want for Christmas?\u201d I text back a screenshot of a shirt and game. She sends a heart. Then a new text from another friend, Emily. \u201cTime to chat this morning?\u201d I respond, \u201cYes! Let me get the kids to school. I\u2019ll call when walking the dog.\u201d Pulling my boots on, my phone vibrates again. This time, it\u2019s Jillian. \u201cWe\u2019ll be in town for the holidays. Dinner at your place?\u201d \u201cYes!\u201d I text back. \u201cCall when you\u2019re in town.\u201d In 2010 study \u201cWomen Doing Friendships,\u201d sociology scholar Eileen Green examined the importance of leisure time and conversations, particularly with other women, as a crucial site of our self-construction. She argues that \u201cleisure contexts, particularly those with other women, are important spaces for women to review their lives; assessing the balance of satisfactions and activities through contradictory discourses which involve both the \u2018mirroring\u2019 of similarities and resistance to traditional feminine identities.\u201d In the carpool line, pushing kids, backpacks, and snow clothes out the door, I pull up Emily\u2019s contact and remember those first few holidays as a new mother\u2014how she would come by, often with a six-pack of specialty beer. Or seedlings from her winter garden. Or cookies from the local farmer\u2019s market. What she brought, in many ways, wasn\u2019t important. What mattered was that she would sit with me and my colicky baby on the couch and talk, laugh, and cry for hours. And since then, we\u2019ve spent years sharing words over walks, dinners, drinks, and travels. I call her and just listen as she shares her challenges on traveling to visit in-laws over the holidays. She doesn\u2019t need my advice, just some space around the ideas she is forming\u2014strategies for healthy boundaries, ways to assure the downtime she knows she\u2019ll need. She says it feels good to talk through it all. I share how it feels good to just listen. A 2021 study explored the biochemistry of these exchanges, finding that friendships among women release calming hormones, helping to negate the impacts of stress. Emily thanks me for listening, says she feels better, clearer about what she needs. At the end of our call, we start to plan a trip together for the spring. I tell her I love her. She says she loves me, too. Back home, I have finally made it to my desk to work for the day. An email pops through from my friend, Nala. It\u2019s her newsletter for her grief work titled, \u201cOur loved ones are not lost! Talking to our ancestors.\u201d I click it open. It\u2019s an intelligent, thoughtful exploration of the ways we use language to talk about our deceased loved ones\u2014lost, gone\u2014creating disconnection instead of connection, she argues. At the end of the email, she encourages her reader to talk lovingly to their dead. She reminds us that we are a mixture and a continuation of all those who came before. I am learning that I am the sum of all the women who have come before me. Definitely my mother. Especially my female friends. This holiday season, I won\u2019t cook her elaborate holiday dinners. I won\u2019t go to midnight mass or trek my two young kids across the country for large extended family gatherings. But I will step closer to the memory of her because of the love and support of the women in my life. I will schedule a phone date with Adrienne, including my children so they can thank her for the presents. Make her elaborate homemade thank you cards, tucked inside a gift we\u2019ll send across the county. I will catch up with Jillian over a simple homemade meal while she is in town, savoring the time we get to spend together. Look for small gifts for Emily\u2014books I know she will like, local bath products, a funny card about in-laws. And I will follow Nala\u2019s prompting\u2014make a small alter with photographs of my grandmother and mom, adding this year, a photo of my dad, too. I will light a candle for each of them, talk to them lovingly. And perhaps this is the best gift we can offer one another, our presence and kind words. In a culture and season that can feel so transactional, being shaped and nurtured by your people\u2019s compassionate attention feels revolutionary.",

    "content": "Each year recently has felt tumultuous, marked by some moments of joy but also much upheaval and tragedy. This year brought new conflicts and celebrations, but it was no less turbulent. We encountered the start of a war, the overturning of a constitutional right, and a scientific discovery that evokes feelings almost too difficult to put into words. In selecting the 10 most impactful images of the year, the TIME photo team considered the scenes they document as well as what those moments represent to the country and the world and what it took for the photographers to capture them. [time-brightcove not-tgx=\u201dtrue\u201d] Meridith Kohut\u2019s image from inside the Houston Women\u2019s Clinic forced us to see what the reversal of Roe v. Wade meant for not only people seeking abortions but for those who care for them. David Butow\u2019s photograph from a memorial in Uvalde, Texas, demanded that we face the effects of gun violence and the resulting grief. Sarahbeth Maney\u2019s image from inside the confirmation hearings for Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson brought to the forefront the importance of having women of color and Black photographers documenting history. As we embark on a new year and all the unexpected events it is sure to bring, these photos will serve as a reminder of the moments that defined 2022. Warning: Some of the following images are graphic in nature and might be disturbing to some viewers. Maya Levin\u2014APIsraeli police confront mourners as they carry the casket of slain Al Jazeera veteran journalist Shireen Abu Akleh during her funeral in east Jerusalem, on May 13. Abu Akleh, a Palestinian-American reporter who covered the Mideast conflict for more than 25 years, was shot dead during an Israeli military raid in the West Bank town of Jenin. \u2018In an Often Violent Landscape, That Day Feels Singular\u2019 On May 11 Palestinian-American journalist Shireen Abu Akleh was shot and killed in Jenin while reporting on Israeli raids. Her death was a shock to the world and weighed deeply on the journalistic community. Two days after her death, fellow journalists and mourners gathered at the hospital, photographer Maya Levin among them. \u201cI was angry and am still angry that a person so clearly marked with a press flack jacket and helmet, surrounded by other journalists, could have been shot as she was,\u201d says Levin. \u201cThis was at the forefront of my mind that day.\u201d Palestinian colleagues of Abu Akleh wanted to honor her by carrying her through the streets of East Jerusalem, to allow others to pay their respects, but what was hoped to be an honoring tribute soon turned violent. \u201cThe Israeli police barred the way out of the courtyard and began to beat the mourners and pallbearers back while they held her coffin,\u201d Levin says. \u201cUsually in situations like that it is better to be on the ground where the action is, but I wanted to get away from the tension that was building below and see what it was like from above.\u201d She maneuvered to a high vantage point where she was able to capture this image. \u201cIn an often violent landscape, that day feels singular. What should have been a respectful day of mourning was instead violated by an aggressive police action.\u201d Noah Berger\u2014APFlames engulf a chair inside a burning home as the Oak Fire burns in Mariposa County, Calif., on July 23. \u2018One of the More Visceral Images I Shot This Season\u2019 According to California\u2019s firefighting agency Cal Fire, 15 of the top 20 most destructive wildfires have occurred in the past seven years. Photographer Noah Berger has covered 14 of them. \u201cCovering wildfires effectively requires a different mentality and skill set from a lot of the assignments I photograph during the year,\u201d explains Berger. \u201cIt often means sleeping in my car for days, working up to 40 hours straight and carrying everything I need to stay self-sufficient in a chaotic environment.\u201d Throughout July, the Oak Fire tore through communities near Mariposa, Calif., destroying more than 125 homes while exhibiting what fire officials called \u201cexplosive fire conditions\u201d including wind-born embers sparking spot fires up to two miles ahead of the main fire front. A forest-service spokeswoman explained to Berger that persistent dry conditions throughout the state meant that \u201cthe window for safety is much smaller for firefighters and residents.\u201d After driving a stretch of roadway with active fires on both sides, amid falling boulders and trees, Berger took this frame at 1:44 a.m. \u201cThis frame is one of the more visceral images I shot this season,\u201d he says. APWomen run away from anti-riot police during a protest of the death of a young woman, Mahsa Amini, who had been detained for violating the country\u2019s conservative dress code, in downtown Tehran, Iran, on Sept. 19. Documenting Defiance Three days before this photo was taken, on Sept. 19 in downtown Tehran, a young woman named Mahsa Amini was declared dead. She had been in the custody of the so-called \u201cmorality police,\u201d who, by dint of enforcing the dress code of the Islamic Republic of Iran, had made themselves the most obnoxious expression of a regime suddenly facing its most serious internal challenge since coming to power 43 years ago. At word of Amini\u2019s death, street protests had broken out in dozens of cities across the country, a spontaneous and leaderless uprising that continues four months later, despite hundreds of deaths and more than 18,000 arrests. No foreign journalists are permitted inside Iran, but in this image obtained by the Associated Press, the forces in play are all visible: Young women have led the rebellion, united by the slogan \u201cWoman, Life, Freedom.\u201d Some choose to wear hijab, others defiantly do not. And some dress for battle with the security forces that contest control of the streets aboard motorcycles, swinging clubs and firing buckshot. On the right is a fire set by protesters, who overturn trash bins and set them alight, both to claim the streets, and, in the approaching night, to sing and dance around. Even the blurring is apt, for a situation very much in flux. \u2013 Karl Vick Sarahbeth Maney\u2014The New York Times/ReduxPatrick Jackson, left, husband of Supreme Court nominee Ketanji Brown Jackson, center, and daughter Leila Jackson, right, look on during confirmation hearings in Washington, on March 21. \u2018Document Our Own Experiences\u2019 Photographer Sarahbeth Maney was working as a photography fellow for the New York Times in Washington when President Biden announced he was nominating Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court. \u201cDuring the confirmation hearings, I continuously asked myself questions in my mind like, \u2018What can I show that\u2019s different? How can I convey the feeling of this moment \u2013 and what it means to the Black community?\u2019\u201d says Maney. \u201cToward the end of the hearing, when I was running out of new ideas and angles to see from, I looked up and noticed Leila [Jackson]\u2019s smile. It stunned me to the point where I didn\u2019t take a photo right away because it made me pause and process what she must have been feeling. The pride. The joy. The hope for her own future. As a photographer, I always try to rely on my instinctive feelings to guide me.\u201d Not long after the image was taken, it was shared widely on social media. \u201cAlthough I had no way of knowing how many people would relate to the image,\u201d says Maney, \u201cI\u2019m grateful people could see themselves represented. I\u2019m grateful that this image served as a symbol of why it\u2019s important to have women of color and Black photographers documenting history. For so long, we have been denied the opportunity to document our own experiences. Although we still face those challenges, I hope others can continue to see why our voices are very much needed.\u201d David Butow\u2014ReduxLocal children and their parents react to a makeshift memorial in downtown Uvalde, nearby Robb Elementary School, on May 26. \u2018Very, Very Raw and Painful to Watch\u2019 On May 24, 19 students and two teachers were killed at Robb Elementary in Uvalde, Texas. The next day, as the nation attempted to understand yet another tragedy, photographer David Butow traveled from his home in Los Angeles to document the aftermath. \u201cI spent most of my childhood in Texas,\u201d says Butow. \u201cI have affection for the place, but in recent years have watched with dismay how the state government has trumpeted an aggressive pro-gun attitude, and I felt that made this event particularly tragic and ironic.\u201d Residents and media gathered at a local park in close proximity to the school. Butow found himself there along with a group of children and parents visiting the makeshift memorials. \u201cI looked around my camera\u2019s viewfinder at all those faces going through various expressions of pain and grief,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was very, very raw and painful to watch, but it was real and it was happening right in front of me so I stayed in place for a few minutes taking dozens of pictures.\u201d Butow says he has mixed feelings about recording these children\u2019s emotions in such a direct way, but he believes it is critical for the public to see the impact of the shooting. \u201cIt makes me sad and angry that Uvalde\u2019s children suffered because of the selfishness and failures of many adults in this country who should be looking after them.\u201d Kyodo/APJapan\u2019s former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, center, falls on the ground after being shot in Nara, western Japan, on July 8. Capturing a Moment in History Former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was shot from behind at close range on July 8 while giving a speech in the city of Nara in western Japan, where he was campaigning for the governing Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) ahead of legislative elections. His death at the age of 67 sent shockwaves around the world and stunned the nation, where gun violence is rare. Japan\u2019s longest-serving prime minister, who had stepped down in 2020 owing to poor health, remained highly influential in Japanese politics until the end. The suspect, who used a handmade weapon in the brazen daylight attack, later said that he held a grudge against the South Korea-based Unification Church, which he blamed for bankrupting his family. An investigation following Abe\u2019s murder uncovered widespread ties between the controversial religious group and the ruling LDP. Although the photographer\u2019s name is not public, this image is likely to be talked about and studied for decades. The composition of the image, which shows Abe\u2019s face as well as the reactions of those around him, is remarkable, but the photographer\u2019s ability to react and capture this moment of history is equally astonishing. \u2013 Amy Gunia Maxim DondyukA Ukrainian soldier helps Julia Pavliuk and her daughter Emma evacuate the Kyiv suburb of Irpin, Ukraine, which Russian forces have tried to seize as part of their push to encircle the capital on March 5. \u2018My Own Emotions Echoed the Ones Depicted in My Photograph\u2019 This photograph was taken by Ukrainian photographer Maxim Dondyuk in the city of Irpin, which had been under constant attack by Russians for several weeks. A bridge had been intentionally blown up so that the Russian tanks would not cross, leaving Ukrainians to flee across the broken remains by foot. Yet for many, it was safer to evacuate under the threat of shelling than stay behind. Hundreds of frightened people were standing under the bridge, waiting to cross while their city burned in the background. \u201cIt all happened so fast,\u201d Dondyuk says, \u201cbut I saw a terrified woman and a determined soldier carrying her crying child \u2014 and as a natural reflex, I made some images. Afterwards, I realized that my own emotions echoed the ones depicted in my photograph: courage, fear, helplessness, and care. I felt all these conflicting feelings at the same time.\u201d The next day Dondyuk returned to the bridge, and things were even worse. The Russians were firing directly at civilians. Dondyuk recalls, \u201cScreams, tears, hysteria, loss of consciousness. Unfortunately, not everyone was as lucky as the woman and baby in my photograph. Many did not make it across, their bodies were left lying on the cold asphalt. Images of World War II emerged, scenes we thought would never be repeated.\u201d Meridith Kohut for The New YorkerNina, (center) and Priscilla (left), staff members of the Houston Women\u2019s Clinic, the largest abortion provider in the city, react immediately after learning of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, and reverse American women\u2019s constitutional right to an abortion, on June 24. \u2018From the Perspective of the People Most Affected\u2019 On June 24 the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, reversing the constitutional right to an abortion. Photojournalist Meridith Kohut was on assignment for the New Yorker, embedded inside the Houston Women\u2019s Clinic, in the moments everything changed. Working alongside writer Stephania Taladrid, who secured rare access to the clinic, Kohut spent several days with the workers as they waited for the decision, knowing that if the landmark case was overturned, they would have to cease all abortion services immediately. \u201cAs a photojournalist, I strive to cover news stories from the perspective of the people most affected\u2026from the frontline,\u201d says Kohut. \u201cIt is incredibly somber, sensitive work to bear witness to women making the profoundly difficult and personal decision to terminate their pregnancy. We understood the historic significance of the day, and the responsibility to document their experience.\u201d Kohut describes how Nina Revillas, the woman at the center of this photograph, \u201cheld a ritual with the director of the clinic \u2013 they would prop up Nina\u2019s cell phone and watch the SCOTUS live blog on days when decisions were announced.\u201d This image was captured in the seconds after the ruling came out. Three weeks later the clinic was closed and staff was laid off. \u201cI spent over a decade living in Caracas, Venezuela, documenting the lives of oppressed women who are denied reproductive freedom in countries across the Global South,\u201d Kohut explains. \u201cI thought a lot about them while working on this story, and the experience has deepened my sense of moral responsibility to continue documenting the plight of American women whose reproductive rights have been taken away.\u201d NASA, ESA, CSA, STScI, Webb EROOne of the first images from NASA\u2019s James Webb Space Telescope showing galaxy cluster SMACS 0723. A Look Inside Our Universe The James Webb Space Telescope took 25 years and $10 billion to design and build\u2014and when it began returning its first album of eye-popping pictures in July, it proved to be worth every year and nickel spent. Webb\u2019s cameras see not in optical light, but in the infrared spectrum, which gives them the capacity to look deeper into space and further into the past than any telescope ever built\u201413.6 billion light-years distant, which means they are seeing the universe in its infancy, as it existed just 200 million years after the Big Bang. This image of the galactic cluster known as SMACS 0723 contains thousands of galaxies, some of which are as far away as 13.1 billion light-years. (A single light-year is just under 6 trillion miles.) The bluer galaxies are more mature ones, containing many stars and little dust. The redder galaxies contain more dust, from which stars are still forming. The Webb is expected to have at least 20 years of usable life ahead of it, which means a wealth of other pictures, and a wealth of fresh knowledge. If the telescope does not kick the doors open to the origin of the universe, it will at least part the curtain wider than it\u2019s ever been before. \u2013 Jeff Kluger Lynsey Addario\u2014Getty ImagesUkrainian soldiers attend to a group of civilians, including Tetiana Perebyinis and her two children, who were mortally wounded by a Russian mortar round while they evacuated from Irpin, Ukraine, on March 6. A volunteer assisting the family was also killed. \u2018My Job is to Be Present, to Focus, and to Document\u2019 In early March, less than a month after the fighting began between Russia and Ukraine, photojournalist Lynsey Addario was in Irpin documenting civilians as they fled across a destroyed bridge toward Kyiv. \u201cThe bridge had been well-documented by journalists in the previous days, and as it was a known civilian evacuation route, I assumed it would be relatively safe to cover. I went early on a Sunday morning, and shortly after arriving Russian forces positioned on the other side of the bridge started shelling the area around it.\u201d As Addario began to realize that Russian forces were targeting civilians, a sudden flash and explosion hit the asphalt between her, colleague Andriy Dubchak, security advisor Steve Bungay, and the line of fleeing civilians. Between struggling to see the aftermath through a cloud of dust, and trying to find out if she was bleeding, Addario eventually made her way across the street where she encountered the bodies of four people, one being a child. \u201cI thought of my two sons and steeled my emotions,\u201d she says. \u201cI wanted to cry, and to flee, but reminded myself I had just witnessed the intentional targeting of civilians, and that I had to make some photographs to document the tragic scene.\u201d The image was later used on the New York Times front page, and received a tremendous amount of attention. \u201cI\u2019ve been covering war for over two decades,\u201d says Addario, \u201cand there were many times early on in my career where I had close calls and was in very dangerous situations. Times when I actually forgot to take photographs, or didn\u2019t get close enough because I was too preoccupied with getting cover and protecting my own life. I\u2019ve since learned that no matter how shaken up I am, if I can manage to pull myself together and get access to something, my job is to be present, to focus, and to document.\u201d",

    "description": "The Canadian province of British Columbia announced that it is suspending new requests for electricity connections for cryptocurrency miners for 18 months. The energy ministry of British Columbia (B.C.) said it is suspending new requests for power from cryptocurrency mining operations at least for the next 18 months. The announcement will not affect miners that already operate in the province. The government of B.C. announced in a statement on December 21 that the pause will allow the province to preserve its power \u2013 most of which is generated through hydroelectricity. The ministry added that the halt will also allow time for the provincial government and First Nations to establish a cryptocurrency mining policy framework. Seven mining projects that already operate in the province and six projects that are in the advanced stages of planning will not be affected by the decision. The mining projects already operating in the province use 273 megawatts of power. Josie Obsborne, Minister of Energy, Mines, and Low Carbon Innovation said in a statement: Cryptocurrency mining consumes massive amounts of energy to run and cool banks of high-powered computers 24/7/365. Adding, \u201cWe are suspending electricity connection requests from cryptocurrency mining operators to preserve our electricity supply for people who are switching to electric vehicles and heat pumps, and for businesses and industries that are undertaking electrification projects that reduce carbon emissions and generate jobs and economic opportunities.\u201d According to the statement by the Ministry, 21 mining projects have requested energy connections and will subsequently be denied permission for the time being. The outstanding requests would require 1,403 megawatts of power, which is sufficient to power more than 500,000 homes or 2.1 million electric vehicles per year.

    "description": "Former CEO and founder of FTX, Sam Bankman-Fried, has been released on $250 million bail as he awaits trial for eight federal charges related to fraud. The 30-year-old crypto whizz is accused of mismanaging billions in customer funds at FTX. A New York federal judge ruled on Thursday that FTX founder SBF will be released on a $250 million bond while he awaits trial for fraud related to his collapsed crypto empire. Per reports by CNBC and Reuters,\u00a0SBF\u2019s bail was secured by his parents Joseph Bankman and Barbara Fried, who offered up their home in Palo Alto, California as collateral. This essentially means that since Bankman-Fried\u2019s parents signed the bond agreement, they would be liable for $250 million should their son decide to flee. Many have wondered how SBF, or his parents, in fact, could afford bail as Bankman-Fried said in late November that he now had \u201cclose to nothing\u201d left and has one remaining credit card with \u201cmaybe $100,000 in that bank account.\u201d Largest Bail in White Collar History It is no surprise that SBF received bail as he is accused of committing a white collar, or financial crime. New York federal prosecutors have indicated SBF\u2019s alleged crimes and the collapse of FTX as one of the largest financial frauds in the history of the United States, and his bond package understandably far exceeds some of the most notorious white-collar cases in that history. Reuters reports that one prominent New York bail bondsman who specializes in high-profile defendants said, \u201cIt\u2019s the largest bond I\u2019ve ever heard of in my history of doing bonds.\u201d One of the most prolific financial crimes in history \u2013 the $65 billion Ponzi scheme in which Bernard Madoff was at the helm, saw him released in 2008 on a $10 million bond. Madoff was ordered to surrender his passport and had to consent to strict monitoring conditions. A more recent scandal saw Elizabeth Holmes, founder of blood testing startup Theranos, who was convicted of defrauding investors, released after her arrest in 2018 on a $500,000 bail bond after she was also required to surrender her passport. Bail Conditions See SBF Surrender His Passport As is common in accused crimes of this nature, defendants typically are required to surrender their passports and must wear monitoring devices. SBF\u2019s bail package is not different. Prosecutor Nicolas Roos told U.S. Magistrate Judge Gabriel Gorenstein that as part of the conditions of his bail, SBF would have to hand over his passport and will see him confined to his parent\u2019s home.

    "content": "According to the latest reports, the Former CEO of the bankrupted FTX empire Sam Bankman-Fried has been released on bail in his recent appearance at the court. Statements from US prosecutors have disclosed that Caroline Ellison, the former CEO of FTX\u2019s sister company Alameda Research, and Gary Wang, the co-founder of FTX, pleaded guilty to charges relating to securities violations. Former CEO of the bankrupted FTX empire Sam Bankman-Fried was arrested in the Bahamas on charges of orchestrating fraud and masterminding the illicit movement of customers\u2019 funds. On Wednesday, his extradition was cleared and brought to the U.S. federal court in New York on Thursday. According to the latest reports, SBF has been released on bail in his recent appearance at the court. His bail was set at $250 million. The bail was reportedly secured by the equity in his \u201cparents\u2019 Palo Alto, California, home\u201d. In addition, a list of requirements was added to set him free while facing the charges. SBF has been ordered not to leave the house unless for exercise. He has also been asked to go through substance abuse and mental health treatment. In addition, he has been banned from creating new lines of credit and facilitating financial transactions of more than $1000. When asked whether he agrees to these conditions, SBF nodded. It is reported that the judge asked him to answer aloud, to which he said \u201cyes, I do\u201d after looking at his lawyer. He would be fitted with a tracking device. According to Judge Gabriel Gorenstein, this would provide enough assurance that SBF would stay put, and his fame would not make it easy for him to flee. The court also believes that SBF is not a threat to anyone since his crimes were financial. Former CEO of FTX sister company pleads guilty Statements from US prosecutors have disclosed that Caroline Ellison, the former CEO of FTX\u2019s sister company Alameda Research, and Gary Wang, the co-founder of FTX, pleaded guilty to charges relating to securities violations. According to U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler, both Ellison and SBF manipulated the price of FTT. Caroline Ellison and Sam Bankman-Fried schemed to manipulate the price of FTT, an exchange crypto security token that was integral to FTX, to prop up the value of their house of cards. Until crypto platforms comply with time-tested securities laws, risks to investors will persist. The guilty plea of Ellison and Wang is likely to play a huge role in the case as they admitted that the senior management was aware of lawbreaking in moving customers\u2019 funds between the two firms. Ellison has reportedly unsealed a plea agreement that says that she will not face further criminal prosecution except for potential tax violations as long as she helps the Southern District of New York and any other law enforcement agency involved in the case with the investigation. Ellison has forfeited her travel documents with her bail set at $250,000. Ellison and Wang have settled enforcement actions with SEC and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). \u00a0 Der Beitrag FTX CEO SBF released on $250M bail with customer funds?

    "content": "London, UK, 22nd December, 2022, Chainwire Crypto firm and earn marketplace Choise.com is excited to announce the start of a new initiative, NFT Token Offering (NTO). By launching NTO Collection Choise.com sets out to introduce new mechanics that will fundamentally change the distribution market for tokens and NFTs. NTO is a new type of token distribution that introduces a new asset class concept \u2013 overcollateralized NFTs. Each NFT offered via Choise.com NTO is backed by the company\u2019s native CHO tokens that are already actively traded on exchanges. This means that each NFT has actual value behind it. In addition to the tokens, a large number of gifts and prizes, whereby the prize pool is $5 million, are hidden in NFTs. Choise.com is a leading earning marketplace that has been around since 2017. It offers a unified ecosystem where people can easily find and make use of various financial solutions to earn on their digital assets. This allows Choise.com clients the chance to select the most promising products and enjoy high returns from their investments without having to delve too deep into technical details. Now Choise.com sets out to change the distribution market for tokens and NFTs. The Chobies NTO Collection is the first in the upcoming line of Choise.com NTO products. It embodies an interesting trend that might pick up in the crypto market over time. Choby NFTs come with a lot of features \u2013 almost a quarter of them come with perks. For example, users can win from 25 to 100,000 USDT in Choby NFTs or get cashback of up to 100%. Users also have a chance to get one of Choise.com\u2019s plastic and metal crypto cards inside a Choby NFT. Also, over 30 million CHO tokens have a 0-12 months lockup period, and vesting period is 0-36 months. However, you can mint a Choby NFT with a shorter or no period at all. The NTO launch will be taking place in 6 stages, and the amount of offered NFTs will grow with each of them. Minting an NFT starts at $150 and grows at each stage by $50. Users can mint a Choby NFT, with thousands of CHO tokens inside. Notably, 1000 CHO cost $850 at the time of writing. Until now the value of NFTs was hard to assess, and their price could fluctuate wildly as a result. With Chobies, investors acquire NFTs that are backed by tokens with real value. Monitoring the rate of CHO allows them to estimate the viability of their investments. In the long term, this can become a great way for companies to expand their operations and grow their shareholder base. NFTs represent a good tool for the tokenization of various creative and financial assets. And Choise.com NTO can help establish a new industry standard where companies with good tokenomics can raise the necessary funds to develop their own products while catering to the desires of market players. As a result, everyone stands to benefit. Visit the Choise.com website for more information on how to take part in this exciting opportunity here.

Despite heroic work by New York City firefighters, in the morning our sanctuary was gone\u2014breathtaking wood and stone reduced to rubble by a six-alarm fire. My beautiful community, already grieving the loss of connection due to the COVID-19 shutdown, was devastated; the fire magnified our grief. While this trauma is particular to Middle Church, what I know through my work as a clergy and psychologist is how so many of us have lived through our own fires these last years: The incessant blaze of racism and rising fascism; families fractured by divisive political discourse; relationships broken by baked-in biases; a global pandemic and the psycho-social effects of worry and isolation. [time-brightcove not-tgx=\u201dtrue\u201d] In the whirlwind, so many are feeling frightened, weary, and alone. This holiday season only exacerbates those feelings. Read More: How To Create a Sense of Belonging In a Divided America In every season, no matter our orientation, how we look or whether we practice any faith, humans yearn to be seen, known, and loved. We flourish in connectivity; we long to belong. The messages we see in the media around the holidays depict families eating, playing, and praying together. There are idealized images of holiday shopping and beautiful people romping in the snow or dancing at parties that can leave us feeling outside of those stories. Further, holiday stress can be difficult on families. Many of us suffer grief, as we recall painful past experiences with regret, or recall treasured days now absent of joy. The economy is in a rut, while our children are fed a diet of all the presents Santa will bring, things budgets can\u2019t bear. Talk at the dinner table can turn as toxic as it is in social media and in the public square. Too often, we regress to old patterns of behavior that no longer serve us. We feel compelled to perform joy when we want to weep. I know; I\u2019ve been there, crying in the ashes. What happens when the busyness ends The immediate aftermath of any tragedy or loss is full of action. While bricks still smoldered, church members were busy buying clothes and essentials for people displaced from the shelter next door. When the pandemic first struck, we scurried to get masks and rapid tests, to keep ourselves and loved ones safe. After a police shooting, we protested in the streets. When we lose a loved one, we are filled with the work of planning a memorial, settling affairs, and tending to the grief of others. However, after the initial crisis, frenzied action gives way to waiting and time begins to stretch. This, for me, is the hardest part: The long and lonesome hours when we are left to sit with the enormity of what we have lost. Moreover, worldly trauma has a way of triggering personal pain, reopening scars we thought had healed. As if grieving our sanctuary wasn\u2019t enough, I found myself wading through other wounds: The loss of my mother to an eight-year battle with lung cancer; the dissolution of a marriage; the vile and racist attacks I experience as a Black female activist. Adrift amid catastrophe, these memories and more haunted me\u2014rattling chains, demanding to be heard. Maybe your ghosts look like mine. Perhaps they\u2019re different. But all of us have experienced suffering, and both theologians and psychologists remind us that this pain does not end when we cease to feel it. More often, it retreats into the recesses of our soul only to emerge when we are vulnerable. Grief, anxiety, and depression can make us feel isolated\u2014particularly when it seems the rest of the world is filled with tinsel and carols. But if you\u2019re feeling lonely, know that you\u2019re not alone. What I found amid my grief was the fiercest love manifested as courage from my communities and tenderness for myself. Just like Jesus was born amid trauma, beauty finds us where we need it most. One of the great joys of community is how people can reflect your situation in ways that do not diminish the enormity of what you experience, but also refuse to let you wallow in sadness. People who know me well would affirm, \u201cIf anyone can make it through these difficult days, it\u2019s you Jacqui. And we\u2019ve got you!\u201d Similarly, it was my siblings who reminded me, honestly, \u201cMom\u2019s death was so hard, but her love is ever-present.\u201d Truth is a prerequisite for healing; we can\u2019t move beyond suffering without it. When I began to sit with the weight of present-day anguish and long-shrouded pain, I was forced to realize that I had not been loving myself well. The perfectionism I developed as a childhood defense mechanism had hardened, shielding me from trauma I had buried. Again and again, I wrapped myself in work, hoping that\u2014if I achieved enough\u2014I could avoid reckoning with my hurt. But that long-deferred bill was due. Perfectionism wasn\u2019t enough; I needed gentleness. What\u2019s love got to do with it Some think it is trite to suggest loving ourselves better to process trauma. And yet, true compassion for who we are\u2014including our flaws, our anxieties, our imperfections\u2014is at the heart of any recovery. Personal affirmations aren\u2019t narcissism, they\u2019re what help us know and own our belovedness. My beloved professor, Dr. James Loder, wrote, \u201cLove is a non-possessive delight in the particularity of the other.\u201d I was transformed by this notion. Non-possessive delight. Not demanding, not judgmental, not waiting to change the object of your affection into who you want them to be. Delight in the particularity. Quirks and super-powers. Beauty and flaws. Children develop best when caregivers provide a nurturing mirror, reflecting and naming their growth. As adults, we can give ourselves that gift: To look at what we\u2019re experiencing honestly, and name that we are finding our way through it. At a time of year when we\u2019re encouraged to think about others, I pray that you find time to celebrate yourself. We can give ourselves the kind of love Loder describes. Delight in our particularities, without judgement or shame. See our quirks and prickly bits alongside our shining light and beauty and love it all. You are your own best thing; leaning into this kind of love for you is a rehearsal for loving those around you. This powerfully resonates with my favorite part of the Christmas story. When Mary discovers she is pregnant, she ought to be terrified. Shame, even death, could be the consequences for pregnancy outside of marriage. And yet, despite those harrowing circumstances, Mary begins to sing: \u201cGod has done great things for me. Surely all generations will call me blessed.\u201d Mary looks at herself, in the middle of what ought to destroy her, and uses that moment to proclaim her sacredness. In a patriarchal society, she defines her own self-worth. She transforms a moment of profound loneliness and alienation into a celebration, not because she has changed her circumstances but because she has changed how she sees and loves herself. How to weather this season If you\u2019re lonely this holiday season, try to find community. Seek out people who can honestly reflect what you are experiencing and help you dream beyond it. Start with the one friend or colleague you know might also be lonely. Be intentional, ask for what you need. Set up a coffee meet-up. Think of the event you can host for a few people in your building. Which holiday movie wants to be watched in a group, with popcorn and hot chocolate? Set up time with your far-away cousins to check-in during halftime, or FaceTime that person with whom you exchanged numbers in a moment of spontaneity. See what happens. As you search for connection, reserve some compassion for yourself. Name what you have been through and celebrate your resiliency. Create a journal; reflect on your story. Where have you overcome obstacles, making yourself proud? What are the \u201cdo-overs\u201d you desire and how can you make amends? Nurture yourself by celebrating that you are on the planet, wonderfully becoming a better you as you breathe. Know that it is likely you and I will not return to how things used to be. But here is the thing about transformation: We don\u2019t leave these hard moments as we went in. And if you\u2019re alone? Let yourself feel the aloneness and see what lessons it has for you, about who you are, what you love, and how to love you better. Make a date with yourself and do that thing. Turn on the music and draw a bath. Alone does not have to be lonely. Read More: Patton Oswalt: How to Conquer Loneliness During the Holidays When we make loving ourselves a prime objective, our self love will be a source of comfort, not only during the holidays but throughout the year. We see more clearly how we are connected to our neighbors. We come to understand that though it may feel like we are adrift at sea, others are swimming nearby. In the spirit of Ubuntu\u2014a human is a human through other humans\u2014we are all inextricably connected. Compassion for our yearning yields empathy for others\u2019 desires. That empathy nurtures connection. Loving ourselves generates the energy we need to love our neighbors. This dynamic is what satisfies our longing to belong. Two years later, Middle Church is rebuilding. We\u2019ve raised millions in a capital campaign to fund a new center for spirituality, justice, and the arts in Manhattan\u2019s East Village, and expect to break ground soon. I am healing, too. I wrote Fierce Love, a memoir about how you and I can rise from ashes with courage and kindness. My father and enjoy a newfound tenderness, that has healed us both. More than anything, I\u2019ve found ways to see and nurture myself. Self-love can heal our endemic loneliness because it breaks the relentless cycle of depression and self-criticism to name the truth: You are holy, fearfully, and wondrously made. Even though you have suffered, that suffering does not define who you are, and it does not control your future. You are capable of goodness and beauty. Love can make you well. Come home to yourself, with love.",

This impacted the BNB price as well which dropped heavily by nearly 24%. This drop ignited ripple effects within the crypto space as most of the cryptos including the Bitcoin price dropped heavily marking a double-digit loss. However, it was largely considered as a FUD as Binance is a very strong exchange and BNB token is a little more diverse than FTT. While Binance Coin is the native token of both the Binance Smart chain and Binance exchange, FTT is the native token of the FTX exchange only. Besides, there are some more features that keep Binance away from the crowd. Binance Smart chain or BSC is the world\u2019s most used chain with the second highest TVL.

    "content": "According to a court document from December 21 showing the defunct cryptocurrency exchange FTX\u2019s retainer payment to bankruptcy attorneys of $12 million as collateral for payment of its costs and expenses throughout Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings. FTX\u2019s historical payments to S&C law firm. Source: aboutblaw.com West Realm Shires Services Inc. paid $12 million to the New York City-based law firm Sullivan & Cromwell LLP (S&C) for legal services on behalf of FTX. Additionally, the document proved that FTX paid S&C close to $3.5 million during the previous 90 days, or from August 26, 2022. According to the facts given, FTX must have paid S&C at least $15.5 million to conduct legal services for FTX. The document also showed that S&C already possesses over $9 million of the $12 million retainer sum. Following the series of payments, FTX declared bankruptcy on November 11, along with the resignation of the CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried. Investors in FTX lost access to the funds kept on the cryptocurrency exchange as a result of the platform\u2019s subsequent collapse. In order for some exchanges to reestablish investor trust, proof-of-reserve initiatives have to be used to publicly display a verification of the existence of users\u2019 cash. Paxful CEO Ray Youssef, on the other hand, supported the concept of Bitcoin self-custody. District Judge Ronnie Abrams resigned from the FTX lawsuit after learning that the exchange had been advised by a legal firm where her husband is a partner in 2021. While making it clear that her spouse was not involved in any of these assertions, she added: \u201cNonetheless, to avoid any possible conflict, or the appearance of one, the Court hereby rescues itself from this action.\u201d In order to avoid any potential conflicts of interest, Judge Abrams withdrew from the FTX lawsuit.

This is a bullish step forward for IOTA, especially considering that the cryptocurrency and blockchain industry has been underwater for most of 2022. The conclusion of the testing at such speed comes as a great surprise for the IOTA community, and it also highlights the possibility of new things ahead of the new year, for the platform. We\u2019re happy to share that we launched our first internal tests with a closed group of beta testers today.

SPYCE will also come in handy for builders and developers within the IOTA community. K\u00f6ther explains that decentralized applications can be developed using SPYCE. In a follow-up tweet, he expands on the usefulness of SPYCE, saying ; \u201cWith SPYCE we aim to provide the best experience for builders and developers to get started quickly, so that they can focus on what they do best: developing awesome dApps and implementing professional use-cases on the most scalable network. Today is the first step, which also helps us to test our behind-the-scenes tools. A big TY to all testers.\u201d IOTA is moving towards launching a privacy-preserving login system Meanwhile, IOTA also revealed on the 27th of July, that it was working on a very promising system. Dubbed \u201clogin with IOTA\u201d, the privacy-preserving login system is centered around accessibility for Web2 and web3 applications to onboard users onto different platforms. Excerpts from the blogpost posted on the official IOTA website explain the technology more in-depth: \u201cThe IOTA Foundation is developing a privacy-preserving login system based on self-sovereign identity (SSI) called Login With IOTA, which allows traditional (Web2) and decentralized (Web3) apps to easily onboard users. In this system, users remain in full control of their data and will be able to securely share information at their discretion.\u201d The Login with IOTA project has been gaining traction since March. In the same month, IOTA launched what it called a \u201crequest for proposals\u201d movement to aid it in securing new partners, to hasten the project\u2019s development. Proposal submissions led to IOTA selecting a proposal from Walt.id. Walt.id provides NFTs, identity, and wallet infrastructure for existing enterprises and developers that supports management for cloud services. A demo of the web2 and web3 flow was also revealed in a video posted to Walt id\u2019s YouTube.

The more the media field around Shiba Inu gets filled with news and rumors about Shibarium , the long-awaited Layer 2 ecosystem protocol, the more frequent the BONE price fluctuations become.

    "description": "Reflection tokens allow holders to earn passive returns from transaction fees by simply holding onto their assets.",
    "content": "Yield farming, liquidity mining , and staking have become common practices in the crypto market due to the remarkable growth the DeFi ecosystem has witnessed in recent years. These features enable users to earn interest on their crypto holdings by locking them as deposits for specific periods. The concepts sound appealing but there's one big risk: the potential decline in the valuation of the locked assets . In other words, users will see losses in U.S. dollar terms if the asset's value drops during the lock-in period. These shortcomings have raised \"reflection tokens\" as a viable alternative. In theory, reflection tokenomics remove the necessity of locking tokens while still offering staking-like benefits. The projects backing the reflection tokens charge a penalty tax (calculated in percentages) on each transaction. In turn, they give out the fee to all token holders depending on the percentage of assets they hold. As a result, reflection tokens' holders do not need to lock their assets for a certain period to earn rewards. They earn their income almost instantly in most cases when a transaction is made, with the functions governed by a smart contract. In addition, users can deposit their reflection tokens in third-party lending and yield farming contracts to earn additional yields. But while the combination of incentives for holding and staking theoretically reduces sell-side pressure, this has not been the case with most reflection assets . Some of the most popular reflection tokens include: SafeMoon (SAFEMOON), BabyFloki (BABYFLOKI), FlyPaper (STICKY), MinersDefi (MINERS), and EverGrow Coin (EGC). For instance, EverGrow Coin (EGC) 's price dropped nearly 98% after peaking at $0.0000039298 in November 2021. This project takes 2% of its network fee and distributes them in the form of Binance USD (BUSD) tokens across the EGC holders. The EGC weekly chart above shows its bearish price trend accompanying very low trading volumes, suggesting that the buying and selling on its network died down after the early hype. Less volume means lower rewards for EGC holders, which may have prompted them to sell their assets. Reflection tokens give holders the benefit of growing their passive incomes with immediate reward distributions. Nonetheless, they carry specific risks that could impact investors' profitability. Let's have a look: Projects asses transaction tax when users buy and sell reflection tokens. In other words, first-time buyers typically pay a transaction fee which they can recoup only if the project gains adoption. As a result, it could take months for investors to see profits. Related: Top-five most Googled cryptocurrencies worldwide in 2022 Scammer can misuse the growing reflection token trend just as any other digital tokens. They could dupe investors into paying initial transaction taxes, only to abandon the project midway and abscond with all the invested funds. Reflection tokens do not guarantee consistent returns given the yields depend on the asset's day-to-day volume. There's a possibility that a token may generate zero yields in the event of no activity on its network. This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

    "description": "Before filing for bankruptcy, FTX paid its lead lawyers over $12 million to oversee the earliest parts of its Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings. According to court filings, the now-bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange FTC paid its lead lawyers, Sullivan & Cromwell LLP a retainer of over $12 million shortly before the firm filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Sullivan & Cromwell indicated that it had drawn only a little more than $3 million of that, and that was for services rendered in the days leading up to the rushed bankruptcy filing according to reports by Bloomberg Law. Sullivan & Cromwell is a firm headquartered in New York City that received this retainer from West Realm Shires Service Inc. on behalf of FTX for legal services the firm required. Available information indicated that FTX paid at least $15.5 million to avail and retain the firm\u2019s services. The court filing further revealed that the law firm currently holds $9 million of the retainer. Developments in the FTX Case FTX filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on November 11 the same day that its former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried resigned. Following the shutdown of the exchange, FTX investors lost access to the funds they stored on the exchange. Most recently, the judge overseeing the SBF-FTX case, District Judge Ronnie Abrams recused herself from the case after she revealed that a law firm employing her husband as a partner had previously advised FTX in 2021. Abrams further explained that the reason for her recusal was informed by the fact that the law firm represented parties that may be adverse to FTX and its former CEO, SBF, in other legal proceedings. SBF was also released on a $250 million bail bond secured by his parents who offered up their home in Palo Alto, California as collateral. The conditions of SBF\u2019s bail also include a written promise that he appears for future court appearances and he does not engage in any illegal activities.

    "content": "Decentralization is an extremely sensitive topic for cryptocurrency enthusiasts as it is the backbone of the whole blockchain industry, and if one of the biggest ecosystems on the whole market is not properly decentralized, it may cause some serious problems. Delphi Digital highlights an important problem that Ether has with decentralization . (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Usually, the composition of holders is the go-to metric for determining a network's decentralization and health. However, in the case of Ethereum, staking is just as important as the distribution of funds. According to Delphi , only four entities manage almost all of the network's staking, and the biggest of them have some systematic issues with decentralization. Related XRP's Local Uptrend Is in Danger as It Reaches $0.35 Lido Finance remains the biggest staker on the network, but its underlying system of redistributing stETH tokens has some critical flaws. After delegating \"real\" coins to Lido, investors receive liquid stETH tokens that they can trade while having Ethereum in locked contracts. However, there is a problem. window.coinzilla_display = window.coinzilla_display || []; var c_display_preferences = {}; c_display_preferences.zone = \"5335d7792eb489ae565\"; c_display_preferences.width = \"300\"; c_display_preferences.height = \"250\"; coinzilla_display.push(c_display_preferences); Ads window.coinzilla_display = window.coinzilla_display || []; var c_display_preferences = {}; c_display_preferences.zone = \"5335d7792eb489ae565\"; c_display_preferences.width = \"300\"; c_display_preferences.height = \"250\"; coinzilla_display.push(c_display_preferences); Ads If you are an investor willing to withdraw your Ethereum from Lido's contracts, you simply will not be able to do so as no ETH has been unlocked from contracts, which raises a lot of concerns among investors . The other stakers on the network are centralized cryptocurrency exchanges that either use the funds of investors who willingly delegate their assets for staking or use their funds in order to redistribute and diversify their holdings. Additionally, Ethereum has been going through a tough year with the number of OFAC-compliant blocks reaching new highs, making the network more centralized. However, with the incentives that Ethereum developers and MEV relays have implemented, the network should become less regulated as time goes by.",

    "content": "Get the weekly summary of crypto market analysis, news, and forecasts! This Week\u2019s Summary The Crypto Market ends the week at a total market capitalization of $810 billion. Bitcoin maintains a similar value to last week\u2019s $16,800. Ethereum gained almost 3% over the past seven days. XRP lost nearly 1% of its value this week. Almost all altcoins are trading in the red, with very few exceptions. The DeFi sector dropped the total value of protocols (TVL) to around $38 billion. Crypto Trends 19-25 December 2022: Market Analysis and Performance The crypto market is in for a silent Christmas celebration following another drab week this year. Most of its assets are bleeding slightly, and most traders have put their wallets under a holiday lock. Even the market capitalization remains still, seesawing by a few billion on each side of the $810 billion level. Bitcoin stagnates at around $16,800, seemingly too weak to launch an attack on the dreaded $17k level this year. The king crypto has had an uneventful week, now ending on the back of a minuscule 0.5% increase. Ethereum is faring only slightly better. The second crypto in command has added around 3% to its value, which is still far from most people\u2019s expectations. ETH has been dabbling in and around the $1,200 threshold for a few weeks. It will likely end the year there with very little optimism in the crypto market to push it further. Meanwhile, the FTX saga continues with yet another surprising development. This week, the exchange\u2019s former CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried, entered the custody of US authorities after his arrest in the Bahamas. He is currently facing criminal charges on multiple accounts, especially after two accomplices pleaded guilty. However, the judge allowed his release on a record-breaking $250 million bail. So, SBF is now back living in his parents\u2019 basement awaiting trial in the billion-dollar lawsuit. Altcoins & DeFi Most altcoins are trading in the red, with very few exceptions. For example, XRP is down by almost 1%, similar to BNB, Polygon, and Dogecoin. Meanwhile, Cardano dropped by over 2%, Polkadot by 5%, and Solana by 7%. Only a handful of altcoins can take pride in their movements this week. For instance, Litecoin is up by 3% and TRON by nearly 2%. The Metaverse sector is driving in the green, quite the opposite of the sentiment in the rest of the crypto market. For instance, ApeCoin increased by 2%, ICP by 3%, Axie Infinity by 2%, and Theta Network by 3%. On the other hand, The Sandbox is down by 6% and Decentraland by 1%. The DeFi sector lost almost $3 billion to the total value of locked protocols (TVL), now at nearly $38.33 billion. Crypto Market Analysis \u2013 What\u2019s in the News? Brazil legalized cryptocurrency as a payment option within the country. Dypius announced live testing for its Metaverse game with $50k in prizes. British Columbia suspended Bitcoin mining requests due to environmental concerns. Next Week\u2019s Crypto Market Forecast The crypto market is slowly dragging toward the end of one of the worse years in history. Most of its assets are eager to put this crypto winter behind and stare optimistically towards brighter horizons. This year\u2019s global economic meltdown has taken its toll on the crypto industry, and it is unlikely anything will change with only seven days left.

When the news was made, investors had reported losing their staked Defrost Finance (MELT) and Avalanche tokens (1) from their MetaMask wallets. \u00a0The platform at the time thought Defrost v1 was not touched by the breach and chose to shut down v2 while they looked into it.Defrost Finance is sad to announce that our V2 has suffered a hack, with an attacker using a flash loan function to withdraw funds.The V1 is not affected. We will soon close the V2 UI and investigate further with our tech team.Updates will be posted on our official channels.\u2014 Defrost Finance \ud83d\udd3a (@Defrost_Finance) December 24, 2022 PeckShield, a blockchain researcher, discovered that the hacker increased his or her profit by almost $173,000 by manipulating the share price of LSWUSDC. The results of PeckShield's study were as follows. The study demonstrates the addition of a phony collateral token and the use of an evil pricing oracle to liquidate existing customers. A loss of more than $12 million is anticipated. Despite the company's proactive announcement of the hack, the neighborhood believes there may have been a rug-pull going on. Defrost v1 was previously declared unaffected by the hack since it lacked a flash loan feature.What should investors do now?Doran, a key squad player, confirmed the attack on both Defrost Finance iterations from Telegram. The platform did, however, afterward recognize an emergency for v1, which stated:\"Our staff is looking into it right now. We humbly request that the community hold off on utilizing the V1 or V2 until upgrades are available.\"Investors are urged not to use Defrost Finance any longer. An internal team is looking into the matter and will contact users via authorized methods. Hackers from North Korea stole cryptocurrency from only one of the decentralized finance (DeFi) networks in 2022, totaling more than 800 billion Korean won ($620 million). All North Korean hackers used foreign DeFi vulnerabilities, according to a spokeswoman for South Korea's National Intelligence Service (NIS). However, the number of North Korean hackers significantly decreased due to Know Your Customer (KYC) measures. (2)",

    "content": "A lawsuit has been filed against Binance France and Binance Holdings Limited for claimed deceptive business practices and dishonest concealment.The damages incurredAccording to local media sources (1), 15 investors in France are suing Binance France and its parent firm Binance Holdings Limited for alleged deceptive business practices and fraudulent concealment. In a case submitted on December 14, the plaintiffs said Binance had broken French law by publicizing and offering cryptocurrency services before being registered in that nation. \u00a0Binance will receive a license to distribute digital assets in May 2022 from France's financial market regulator, the Autorit\u00e9 des march\u00e9s financiers.The authorization permitted the cryptocurrency exchange to provide services, including asset safekeeping and cryptocurrency trading. Screenshots of Binance's social media activity, including a Telegram channel called \"Binance French,\" are allegedly included in the lawsuit. The plaintiffs further assert that they lost more than 2.4 million euros due to TerraUSD's (UST) collapse, despite Binance's claims that the US dollar backed the token.Binance's responseBinance France (2) answered inquiries about the incident in a blog post. It states that the business made no promotional communications in France during the relevant time and explained that Telegram groups are worldwide community forums, enabling users to build and join channels voluntarily. In addition, Binance answered inquiries on Terra stablecoin promotion in the nation. The business pointed out that its messaging portrays staking with Binance as \"secure, and not the underlying tokens.\" The exchange added that it had enhanced its descriptions and always provided market risk cautions for cryptocurrency goods. The price of the LUNA token and its accompanying stablecoin TerraUSD (UST), intended to maintain algorithmic parity with the United States dollar, declined to below $0.30 in May 2022 as a consequence of a series of dramatic events.",

    "content": "American businessman and entrepreneur Marshall Field once said that buying real estate is the best way, the quickest way, the safest way, and may be the only way to become wealthy. But why would you learn from experience of an accomplished and successful man? Instead, we should heed the \u201cwisdom\u201d of a person who writes for the Atlantic. Jerusalem Demsas\u2019s article declares \u201creal estate should be treated as consumption, not investment.\u201d She admits that she \u201cdoesn\u2019t know if you should buy a house.\u201d In fact, her main area of expertise is inventing pronouns nobody has yet thought of. But she is still compelled to tell you that if you consider buying a home for your family, you are a terrible person and you should stop: \u201cHomeownership doesn\u2019t even consistently deliver on the core promise of providing financial security. And, crucially, pushing more and more people into homeownership actually undermines our ability to improve housing outcomes for all.\u201d As someone who owes my family\u2019s financial security to owning a home, I was genuinely interested in the arguments against it. Reading the article, here is what they were: \u201cBlah blah equal outcomes blah blah black people blah blah racial disparities blah blah sweat equity blah blah blah public facilities blah blah blah wealth building.\u201d The author pretends to argue that buying a home is a bad investment. Per her own admission, she doesn\u2019t know much about real estate, so inevitably every one of her arguments can be shredded in 5 seconds. \u201cHomeownership doesn\u2019t even consistently deliver on the core promise of providing financial security.\u201d Fact-check: \u201cand?\u201d No investment consistently delivers financial security. Every investment involves an element of risk and largely depends on hard work and research. The author\u2019s goal of \u201cguaranteed financial security\u201d can only be achieved by means of the government defining \u201csecurity\u201d for you and then giving you just enough to afford it. \u201cHome values, which purportedly built the middle class, are predicated not on sweat equity or hard work but on luck.\u201d Fact-check: false. While a certain element of luck is involved in any investment, real estate is the least vulnerable. Home values have gone up consistently throughout the past decades, and while some downturns were inevitable, most people end up richer rather than poorer while owning real estate. Other types of investments tend to be a lot riskier. \u201cThe wealthiest Americans are the least likely to store their wealth in their homes. Certainly, they benefit from owning their homes, but the wealthier the American, the more likely they are to hold their assets in equities and mutual funds.\u201d Fact-check: \u201cand?\u201d The wealthiest Americans also consistently own their homes \u2013 and most own multiple properties. Just because they own other investments as well does not mean that owning a home is a bad investment \u2013 otherwise, why would they continue owning homes? Diversifying your investments is always good if you can afford it, but if you can\u2019t, buying a home is your best bet. Your home usually grows in value, and even if it doesn\u2019t you get to live in it without the instability that comes with renting. \u201cPeople also tend to underrate the hidden costs of owning a home, including property taxes, utilities, maintenance costs, and upkeep.\u201d Fact-check: false. There are definitely costs involved with owning a home, but very few homeowners \u201cunderrate\u201d them. In fact, every homeowner you know probably told you a hundred times about rising cost of insurance and repairs. However, what you invest in your home eventually pays off, especially if you keep your house long term. Most people who choose to rent do so not because of the cost, but because of the logistics of home ownership. Home maintenance involves time and effort as well as money, and while the financial investment is usually worth it, the headache doesn\u2019t, for some people. That is why they choose to take a financial hit of renting, the same way you would choose to hire a caterer instead of saving money and cooking yourself. None of the author\u2019s arguments against home purchase is very convincing \u2013 but then again, they were never intended to be. The only real argument she wanted to present (and you see her come back to it over and over again) is this: owning your own home ruins \u201chousing equity.\u201d This article could be written about practically anything. Take any asset you possess and someone else lacks \u2013 a house, a car, a family, a gym membership \u2013 and you can write the same bunch of gibberish of why you should give it up in favor of \u201cequity.\u201d If you have something others don\u2019t, you didn\u2019t get it by fair means. You got it because you are white, or your father was a cis-gender male, or the teachers in your school didn\u2019t wear purple hair, a face tattoo, and a pronoun button. But someone else wasn\u2019t as fortunate, and now they have fewer things than you do. So, instead of encouraging people to work harder to compensate for whatever disadvantage held them down, the social justice warriors demand that you surrender your possessions and \u201clevel the playing field.\u201d After the Revolution of 1917, the Bolsheviks marched into the wealthy people\u2019s apartments and gave each room to a separate family. Because private home ownership was not allowed in the Soviet Union, 60 years later, people still lived in the \u201ccommunal\u201d apartments. Living in them was the most horrible nightmare for my friends who were unfortunate enough. The stories of a young family with a baby waiting for 6 \u201chousemates\u201d to finish using a single restroom, or 3 generations sharing one room, all stem from the same idea: \u201chousing equity.\u201d Home ownership is an idea that is still unique to America. Very few (and very wealthy) people in Europe live in their own homes. Their apartments tend to be small and lacking amenities even low-income Americans consider basic. That is mainly the reason many Europeans are so keen on lecturing us on being \u201cobsessed with material possessions.\u201d Then, every one of them who gets a chance to live in America immediately buys the biggest house on the block. \u201cLet housing be a home; let it provide shelter, access to good jobs, and safe and healthy communities. Just don\u2019t let it be an investment.\u201d From someone who came to this country with no money, investing in my own home provided me financial stability and security. My first house was so tiny I could switch the TV channels sitting on my couch. But it was a warm and welcoming place for my newborn babies. Saving money on rent eventually allowed my family to buy a bigger house; then to move into a better school district; then to afford a more comfortable lifestyle; and finally, to own multiple homes as a way to make extra income. Investment in real estate is the best financial decision you can make. As any investment, it requires planning, strategizing, hard work, and yes, a certain element of luck. As most families choose to only own a home that they live in, it is still a great way to invest your money without even realizing it. Owning a home is happiness, no matter of your race or financial situation. But the \u201csocial justice warriors\u201d don\u2019t want happy people. Their job security depends on some groups of society being constantly enraged at others. That\u2019s why they wake up every morning thinking of some arguments \u2013 any arguments \u2013 that will convince you how someone else\u2019s happiness is actually a stumbling block for you to achieve your own. And that is where every American family aspiring to own their own home is a threat to them. Owning a home produces more happy people. And happy people don\u2019t usually have a subscription to The Atlantic.

    "content": "The post Orbeon Protocol, Ethereum, And Polkadot \u2013 3 Must-Have Tokens For The Bear Market appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Many cryptocurrencies are in bad shape right now, but Ethereum (ETH) and Polkadot (DOT) are still holding on.\u00a0Orbeon Protocol (ORBN is also defying the norm and seeing continued growth throughout its presale. Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) is currently in phase 3 of its presale, analysts estimate it will climb over 6,000% in the coming weeks. Let\u2019s go through the three must-have coins for the bear market. Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) The creation of Orbeon Protocol was motivated by a desire to replace the VC sector by providing a mechanism through which companies may offer fractionalized NFTs as a service (NFTaaS)\u00a0to your everyday investor. In return, these fractionalized NFTs will provide investors with a marketplace where they may identify legitimate firms and investment possibilities. On Orbeon Protocol\u2019s platform, startups seeking to raise capital issue fractionalized, equity-backed NFTs that may be purchased by the general public for as little as $1. Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) is also a more secure investment alternative to Ethereum (ETH) and Polkadot (DOT) due to a 10-year lock on the liquidity pool and a 1-year lock on the team tokens. Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) offers a variety of useful services, including an exchange, a swap, a wallet, and more. This is why many investors are more than willing to switch to Orbeon Protocol in favour of other failing cryptocurrencies. The price of Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) is predicted to increase by nearly 6,000%, from its current level of $0.0302 to a high of $0.24. The real-case utility of Orbeon in the $13.5 billion dollar venture capital and crowdfunding industry continues to attract investors to the platform, raising its price, especially during the ongoing presale stage. Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum is among the most popular blockchain platforms currently available. While there have been a number of imitators of Ethereum appear recently, Ethereum remains the most prominent platform of its kind.\u00a0 Ethereum\u2019s blockchain network allows for the public creation of trustworthy digital ledgers. Many blockchain-based apps\u00a0rely on Ethereum as their underlying network.\u00a0 Investors have grown bullish about Ethereum (ETH) in recent weeks due to its highly anticipated \u201cMerge.\u201d Beacon\u2019s Proof-of-Stake protocol will replace the blockchain\u2019s original Proof-of-Work protocol.\u00a0 During the changeover, gas costs, transaction times, and network congestion will all be adversely impacted. As a major step forward, this move is being applauded by the investment community as a means to speed up Ethereum\u2019s mainstream acceptance. Polkadot (DOT) Polkadot, created by Ethereum creator Dr. Gavin Wood, provides a solution for interoperability, a major barrier to the widespread use of blockchain technology.\u00a0 All transactions are signed using Polkadot\u2019s native currency, DOT, and data transfers between blockchain networks are made possible with the help of Polkadot\u2019s parachains, a component of Polkadot\u2019s cross-chain compatible technology. The protocol\u2019s widespread adoption has driven up the cost of Polkadot, as more and more startups are seeing the value of Polkadot\u2019s capabilities and incorporating them into their own business strategies for the benefit of their clients.

    "content": "The post <strong>Binance In Legal Trouble, Sued For 2.4 Million Euros </strong> appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News As a result of the failure of rival cryptocurrency exchange FTX, Binance, which is the biggest cryptocurrency business in the world, has had a difficult few weeks. In addition, its token, BNB, has been trading consistently in the red. After a series of crypto exchange collapses this year, crypto investors have grown cynical about statements made by senior executives regarding the financial health of their companies. Binance France Sued Recent developments at Binance include a lawsuit filed against the exchange and its French subsidiary. Fifteen investors filed a lawsuit against Binance on December 14 alleging that the exchange had broken French law by promoting and selling cryptocurrency services before obtaining proper authorization from French authorities. The lawsuit includes images that illustrate Binance\u2019s activity on social media prior to the issuance of its license. These activities include the creation of a Telegram channel under the name Binance French. The plaintiffs additionally allege that they have suffered a loss of over 2.4 million euros as a result of the collapse of TerraUSD (UST), despite the fact that Binance promoted the token as being backed by the United States dollar, and they want their money back. Binance Responds Binance France provided their responses to inquiries about the issue in a blog post. It states that the firm did not engage in any promotional activities in France during the time period in question. Additionally, it was mentioned that Telegram groups are worldwide community forums, which enable users to freely establish and join channels. They said: \u201cBinance did not promote in France before being allowed to do so. Telegram groups are global community forums, which any Telegram user can create or join voluntarily.\u201d Is Binance On The Verge Of Collapse? Without a question, the demise of FTX has caused Binance a great deal of trouble. Despite the fact that the platform has displayed time and time again that it is reliable and safe, a significant number of investors now avoid using it. As a matter of fact, some have even predicted that Binance may go down soon.\u00a0 If Binance falls, hardly anyone will be able to salvage it. Meanwhile, others display unrelenting faith in the exchange and it\u2019s CEO \u201cCZ\u201d.",

    "content": "The post Cryptocurrency Market Sees Mixed Results \u2013 Litecoin And Tron Show Negligible Growth While Snowfall Protocol Skyrockets appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The cryptocurrency market has seen mixed results in recent months, with some coins experiencing significant growth while others have struggled to maintain their value. In this article, we will take a closer look at the performance of three popular cryptocurrencies: Litecoin (LTC), Tron (TRX), and Snowfall Protocol (SNW). While Litecoin (LTC) and Tron (TRX) have seen negligible growth, Snowfall Protocol (SNW) has skyrocketed by 400%. Litecoin (LTC) struggles to maintain value amid low liquidity and security concerns In 2011, Litecoin (LTC), a cryptocurrency, was developed as a derivative of Bitcoin. Despite its early start, LTC has struggled to establish itself as a viable alternative to BTC. One of the key reasons for Litecoin\u2019s (LTC) lack of success is its low value. The price of Litecoin (LTC) has plummeted in recent years, and it is currently trading at $66.39. This lack of value makes Litecoin (LTC) a less attractive option for investors and traders compared to other cryptocurrencies. Another issue with Litecoin (LTC) is its low liquidity. It can be difficult to trade Litecoin (LTC) for other currencies, which makes it less attractive to those looking to buy or sell it. This low liquidity further adds to the difficulty of getting value out of Litecoin (LTC). Its low value, lack of security, and low liquidity make it a much less attractive option compared to other cryptocurrencies like Snowfall Protocol (SNW). Risk of investing in Tron (TRX) increases due to the combination of struggling value and FTX bankruptcy Since reaching its high in January 2018, Tron (TRX) has struggled to maintain its value. The cryptocurrency saw a significant drop in value, just a month after reaching its peak. While it briefly rebounded in 2021, it has since entered a downward spiral, caused by a combination of factors, including the overall crypto crash and a supply that exceeds the demand for Tron (TRX). Additionally, Tron (TRX) has recently been hit by the bankruptcy of the crypto platform FTX. Investors are trying to withdraw their funds from the sinking exchange as quickly as possible, and as a result, the Tron (TRX) coin is now trading $0.055 lower on FTX than its market value. Thus, Tron holders are having to pay a premium of 400% just to move their Tron (TRX) tokens, leading to significant losses for many investors. The combination of Tron\u2019s struggling value and the FTX bankruptcy has made the cryptocurrency a riskier asset. Snowfall Protocol (SNW) offers an innovative cross-chain transfer ecosystem with 1000x potential Snowfall Protocol (SNW) is a cross-chain transfer ecosystem that allows users to easily swap assets between different blockchain networks. It is designed to connect the most widely used EVM and non-EVM compatible chains, creating a bridge for millions of people to access every blockchain. One of the key features of Snowfall Protocol (SNW) is its innovative multi-chain technology, which makes it possible for users to enjoy a suite of benefits such as easy asset transfers, low fees, and high liquidity. These benefits are just a few of the reasons why experts believe that Snowfall Protocol (SNW) has the potential to grow 1000x in value. Snowfall Protocol\u2019s (SNW) Stage 2 recently sold out, but you can still get in on Stage 3. The price of Snowfall Protocol (SNW) has already surged by $0.14 and has seen a growth of over 400%. With the prototype of the dAPP just announced, it is a great opportunity to get involved in this revolutionary project and potentially make 1000x gains. Conclusion In conclusion, the cryptocurrency market has seen mixed results in recent months. Litecoin (LTC) and Tron (TRX) have struggled to maintain their value due to a variety of factors, including low liquidity, lack of security, and low demand. On the other hand, Snowfall Protocol (SNW) has seen significant growth and has the potential to grow 1000x in value due to its innovative multi-chain technology and suite of benefits.

    "description": "Clinical trials are a necessary step\u2014and usually the final step\u2014in the development of new medicines",
    "content": "It is fortunate that, in a majority of cases, kidney cancer is caught before spreading to other parts of the body. For these patients, treatment usually involves a nephrectomy, which is the surgical removal of one or both of the kidneys. The goal of the surgery is to prevent the cancer from metastasizing. Unfortunately, many people who undergo a nephrectomy for high-risk disease\u2014between 20% to 50%, according to recent estimates\u2014will eventually go on to develop metastatic cancer. Until recently, there wasn\u2019t much a person\u2019s care team could do in this situation to stop the cancer from coming back. Reliably effective \u201cadjuvant\u201d immune therapies\u2014something added to surgery to prevent the cancer\u2019s return\u2014had not yet been identified. But in 2021, the New England Journal of Medicine published the results of a groundbreaking clinical trial. The trial involved roughly 1,000 people undergoing nephrectomy who were at high risk for cancer recurrence. About half of the people took a placebo pill, while the other half took a kidney cancer drug called pembrolizumab. Pembrolizumab is an immune checkpoint inhibitor\u2014a type of immunotherapy drug that stimulates the immune system to fight cancer cells. After two years of follow-up, the people in the trial who took the immunotherapy drug were significantly less likely to have had a cancer recurrence than those taking the placebo. A few months later, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved pembrolizumab as a form of adjuvant therapy. [time-brightcove not-tgx=\u201dtrue\u201d] \u201cThis was a win-win situation,\u201d says Dr. Toni Choueiri, one of the leaders of that trial and director of the Lank Center for Genitourinary Oncology at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston. Not only did the people involved in the trial benefit from the drug, but the experiment\u2019s findings also helped expand the medical community\u2019s knowledge of the disease and its arsenal of weapons. Clinical trials like the one Choueiri led are happening all the time across the country. They are a necessary step\u2014and usually the final step\u2014in the development of new medicines for the treatment of kidney cancer. But they don\u2019t always involve drugs. Clinical trials are also used to vet the effectiveness of new surgical techniques, new diagnostic procedures, and anything else that could improve the lives of people with kidney cancer. While some trials break new ground, others examine small changes to the existing standards of care\u2014such as adjusting the dose of a drug up or down, or changing the way treatment side-effects are managed. In all cases, a trial\u2019s results help shape the way every person who develops kidney cancer is treated, and so their importance cannot be overstated. Here, Choueiri and other kidney cancer specialists detail the latest developments in the trial landscape. They also explain who is eligible to participate in clinical trials, how enrollment in a trial works, and how trials have helped revolutionize the field of kidney cancer medicine. Mapping the current trial landscape Kidney cancer doesn\u2019t respond well to conventional cancer treatments, such as standard radiation or chemotherapy. As recently as 2005, there was only one type of medication\u2014an immunotherapy medicine called interleukin-2\u2014that had FDA approval for the curative treatment of kidney cancer. Thankfully, the situation today is much different. \u201cWe now have more than a dozen FDA-approved drugs, and every single one of them has been approved and is available because of randomized clinical trials,\u201d says Dr. James Brugarolas, director of the Kidney Cancer Program at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas. Brugarolas is involved in translational research, which aims to bring scientific discoveries made in the lab or in animal models into the realm of human medicine. Some of his recent work has involved a transcription factor called HIF-2. A transcription factor is basically a protein molecule that controls the activity of a gene, and HIF-2 regulates a gene that affects the growth of kidney cancer tumors. For years, there was speculation that blocking the activity of HIF-2 could stop or slow the growth of kidney cancer. However, because of HIF-2\u2019s unusual structure, typical drugs could not bind to it. HIF-2 was basically \u201cundruggable,\u201d Brugarolas says. But several years ago, researchers at UT Southwestern identified a cavity in an HIF-2 protein that could be exploited with specially designed drugs. Brugarolas has helped develop those drugs, which are called HIF-2 inhibitors, and a series of clinical trials has demonstrated that they are effective for several types of kidney cancer. \u201cVery few cancer drugs target transcription factors, so this is a new paradigm,\u201d he says. Brugarolas notes that clinical trials on HIF-2 inhibitors are ongoing, and similar trials are looking at many other novel drug treatments. Like other forms of cancer, kidney cancer isn\u2019t really one disease, he says. It\u2019s more accurate to call it a family of related cancers that have diverse characteristics. Some of his other work, including clinical trials he\u2019s led, has examined these characteristics to determine how certain patient groups will respond to certain therapies. While some clinical trials examine groundbreaking new treatments, others involve new cocktails of existing drugs. This sort of \u201ccombination therapy\u201d is an especially active area of kidney cancer research, says Dr. Eric Jonasch, a kidney cancer specialist and professor of genitourinary medical oncology at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. A handful of combinations have already received FDA approval. \u201cMore combinations are coming down the pipeline, and not just doublets, but triplets.\u201d Not all the trial work is concerned with drug treatments. \u201cThere have been advancements in surgical techniques, such as robotic surgery,\u201d Jonasch says. A specialized type of radiation therapy is another promising area of research. \u201cThe ability to focus radiation while minimizing collateral damage has significantly improved,\u201d he says. Radiation could offer improvements over broader \u201csystemic\u201d treatments for people with kidney cancers that have metastasized. \u201cIt could even treat kidney tumors themselves without surgery,\u201d he adds. The benefits of all this trial work are significant\u2014and quantifiable. \u201cKidney cancer is a disease where, maybe 15 years ago, someone diagnosed with stage 4 disease had just one year to live, and now the average is closer to five years,\u201d Choueiri says. The next decade is sure to bring more substantial improvements in the lives and longevity of people with kidney cancer. But to get there, clinical trials need participants. Read More: Coping With the Side Effects of Kidney-Cancer Treatment The benefits of participating in a clinical trial The precise risks and rewards of clinical trial participation will vary from one patient\u2014and trial\u2014to the next. But broadly speaking, experts say there are two compelling reasons for people with kidney cancer to take part in this type of medical research. \u201cNumber one, trial participation may give patients the opportunity to access therapies that might not otherwise be accessible to them,\u201d Jonasch says. In nearly all cases, the cost of these therapies\u2014which can be considerable\u2014will be picked up by the companies or institutions running the trial. For those who may be concerned about trying an experimental treatment, Jonasch says that every clinical trial must be approved by a review board\u2014an unaffiliated group of experts who scrutinize the proposed trial to ensure that participants are not exposed to undue risks. \u201cBecause of how ethical boards function today, you\u2019re very likely going to get something that is either equivalent or superior to standard care,\u201d he says. Research in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute has found that people with cancer who participate in clinical trials tend to fare slightly better than those who don\u2019t. Especially for those with advanced cancers with a poor prognosis, trial participation can be beneficial, that study found. It\u2019s not an exaggeration to say that taking part in a clinical trial has meant the difference between life and death for some participants. \u201cI have a lot of patients who were involved in clinical trials of small-molecule [drugs] or immunotherapies who, if they had gotten the standard of care back then, would not be alive right now,\u201d Choueiri says. Another benefit to trial participation is the impact its findings have on the cancer community. \u201cYou\u2019re contributing to the expansion of our knowledge of the disease, and you\u2019re helping in the development of therapies that will benefit other patients,\u201d Jonasch says. One of the tragedies of cancer is that, in many cases, it robs the world of all the good someone may have done had their life not been disrupted or cut short by the disease. \u201cFor many patients, life has been significantly undermined by cancer, and they may appreciate the opportunity to help other people who have the same disease,\u201d Brugarolas says. Read More: The Latest Breakthroughs That Could Improve Kidney Cancer Treatment How to take part in a clinical trial The first step is to ask your care team if you may be a good candidate for a clinical trial, Choueiri says. Referral from a cancer specialist or physician is the most common route to trial enrollment. However, you may also have to do a little research on your own. \u201cThe entire field of oncology, not just kidney cancer, is expanding at a rate where it\u2019s very hard to know everything that\u2019s going on,\u201d Choueiri says. If you\u2019re not being treated at a major research hospital or health system, your care team may not be aware of trials that could benefit you. There are a variety of ways to find trials on your own. \u201cVisit ClinicalTrials.gov,\u201d Jonasch suggests. This is a comprehensive database of clinical trials taking place in the U.S. and in other parts of the world. You can search it based on your type of cancer and your location, and it could help you find trials that are worth flagging to your doctors. Jonasch also recommends connecting with kidney cancer patient advocacy organizations, such as the Kidney Cancer Association and the International Kidney Cancer Coalition, to ask about clinical trials. \u201cThese groups can be a tremendous resource for navigating these waters,\u201d he says. Finally, he says there is an especially great need for more trial participation among people of color, who are not always appropriately represented in this work. He blames problems of access and recruitment for these shortfalls. \u201cWe\u2019re not getting it right yet, but there are efforts underway to ensure we\u2019re reaching out to communities that may not have access to clinical trials,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s extremely important that we have representative diversity to ensure we understand the effects in all patient groups.\u201d Clearly, there\u2019s a lot going on in the trial space for kidney cancer. It\u2019s a safe bet that more breakthroughs may soon follow.",

    "content": "Vox; Getty Images/CSA Images RF We bid adieu to moonshots, Portals, and ad-free Netflix. This was not a great year for Big Tech. In 2022, the economy slumped, stocks fell, inflation skyrocketed, and belts tightened. Silicon Valley was one of the hardest-hit places, partly because some of its companies had experienced such explosive and sustained growth for so long that it almost didn\u2019t seem possible for that growth to stop or even slow down. And yet, here we are. As quarterly earnings calls began to use ominous phrases like \u201ceconomic headwinds\u201d and business models were upended, tech companies realized it might be time to cut back on a few money-losing projects and initiatives. Some of them were big projects that companies put a lot of resources into, hoping that a few might pay off, and, in Google\u2019s words, \u201credefine humanity.\u201d With those resources drying up, efforts that might never come close to seeing the light of day became obvious targets for cuts. Some of what got cut were much less ambitious products or services that just weren\u2019t profitable and the worsening economy made the runway to get them there much shorter. And then there\u2019s Meta, which is continuing to invest a tremendous amount of money into the metaverse \u2014 something that may never pay off \u2014 because Mark Zuckerberg insists it\u2019s the future of his company and also the internet. But even those funds now have to come from somewhere else in the company. While the end of certain things probably won\u2019t do much for the future of our planet, the end of some of these humanity-redefining moonshots might be a bigger loss. Then again, none of them, with the possible exception of Waymo, ever really panned out. At least one of them \u2014 an Alphabet project called Mineral that wants to make food production more sustainable \u2014 is now being used by a berry grower to examine strawberries, which seems like the kind of thing that will help the berry grower and Google more than the rest of us. Here are a few of the ambitious gambles and more grounded projects that didn\u2019t pay off in 2022: Meta had some big problems in 2022. The app privacy changes that Apple rolled out in 2021, which allowed users to opt out of being tracked across apps, cost the company billions. Meta relies on some of that data to target ads to you and to be able to tell businesses how those ads performed, thus enabling them to sell more ads for more money. Josh Edelson/AFP via Getty Images In 2022, we will say good-bye to Meta\u2019s Portal. Meta laid off more than 11,000 employees in November as its stock continued to plummet to historic lows. That reduction also meant saying goodbye to some of its non-metaverse hardware, a division that has never done much for Meta anyway. RIP Portal, the camera Facebook put in your kitchen. Also the smartwatch that never got a chance to see the world. Could Meta\u2019s smart sunglasses be next? Also getting cut was the newsletter service Bulletin, which never caught on like Substack did (Twitter cut its own newsletter, Revue, although it\u2019s not clear if the economy is to blame for that or whether Twitter\u2019s new owner, Elon Musk, is). Meta\u2019s experimental product arm is now reportedly shrinking to focus just on short videos (very TikTok!) and it recently shut down its connectivity division, which developed or improved ways to access the internet. Google and its parent company, Alphabet, fared better than Meta in 2022. But things still weren\u2019t great, and there are rumors that Google is due for some layoffs soon, too. Its famed \u201cmoonshot factory,\u201d X, has a track record of flops even in the best of times. One X project, Loon, which tried to use weather balloons to beam internet to remote areas and was shut down in 2021, was spun off into an independent company. Area 120, Google\u2019s incubator where employees got to work on experimental ideas for the company, has been scaled back. The Pixelbook, Google\u2019s attempt to make an expensive Chromebook, has been discontinued. There are big cuts in the Google Assistant team. And Stadia, Google\u2019s cloud gaming service, will be shutting down in January. Google also just pulled out of building a long-planned data center (Meta has also canceled work on data centers). Amazon has also facing some problems. Layoffs are looming, and its stock price is down 50 percent in 2022 alone. The company is closing up or not going forward with plans to build several warehouse and delivery facilities. There are also product cutbacks, including the reported scaling back of Amazon\u2019s voice assistant Alexa, which costs a lot and doesn\u2019t make much (much like Google Assistant). Glow, a video calling device for children, is done just a year after its debut. Telehealth service Amazon Care will end when 2022 does \u2014 though Amazon also spent billions to acquire another primary care and telehealth service, One Medical, this year. The Grand Challenge lab, Amazon\u2019s moonshot-like arm, reportedly shut down three out of five of its projects in October. And Wickr, an end-to-end encrypted messaging app Amazon acquired just last year, will end its free version at the end of 2023, which will also see the end of cloud storage service Drive. Olly Curtis/Future Publishing via Getty Imag A controller for Google\u2019s cloud gaming platform, Stadia, which is closing up shop in a few weeks. And then there\u2019s Apple and Microsoft. They\u2019ve been around longer and so have more experience with economic downturns, which might be why they\u2019re both faring better than their rivals. Apple\u2019s take on the VR headset is still reportedly on the way in 2023, though the mysterious Apple Car has apparently been scaled back (it won\u2019t be fully autonomous) and delayed another year. That might have more to do with the technology not being there than the economy. Apple is expanding its ad offerings, though, which might be a way to bring in extra revenue at a time when people are cutting back, possibly including on their purchases of Apple devices. As for Microsoft, it had some layoffs in 2022 and seems to be putting its efforts to move back into the consumer market on pause. Its HoloLens VR headset also seems to be having some issues. But the company has been through much worse times and had far more expensive flops over the years. There are also a few Big Tech-adjacent cuts. Snap, which was particularly hard hit by changes in the advertising industry, discontinued its short-lived selfie drone, Pixy, as its stock tanked and it laid off thousands of employees. Snap is also getting more aggressive about monetizing its AR arm. Kitty Hawk, a Larry Page-backed attempt to create flying cars, made an emergency landing into reality and shut down. Twitter was decimated, but we can safely blame that on other factors. Some streaming platforms are struggling, too. Netflix, once one of the biggest success stories in the business, is losing subscribers and has had to introduce ads, which was a longtime no-go for the company. Disney+ just rolled out its own lower-priced ad tier while bumping up the price of its ad-free offering. The Warner Media-Discovery merger led to some major changes and cuts. CNN+ was live for less than a month, while HBO Max shut down several projects that were in the works and removed other shows from the platform entirely. So, yeah, not a great year for Big Tech, Big Tech-adjacent companies, and cool experiments that needed many years and dollars to have a chance of success. The buzzwords that promised to be the future of the industry at the beginning of this year \u2014 Web3, the metaverse, crypto \u2014 have flamed out for now, if not forever. We\u2019re only just seeing the potential of generative AI, an effort that\u2019s led not by a tech giant but by a relatively new company called OpenAI. For all of its money-burning moonshot projects, Big Tech might have missed the boat on its own future. At least until the next big thing comes along.",

    "description": "New tax credits are making some of the most energy-efficient systems more affordable in the new year, creating an option to possibly save your family money.",
    "content": "A working furnace has been much appreciated this holiday season in many parts of the country, especially with record-breaking temperatures.A working heating and cooling system is probably not something you think of until you need it.However, new tax credits are making some of the most energy-efficient systems more affordable in the new year, creating an option to save your family money possibly.WHAT'S A HEAT PUMP? Heat pumps have been around since the 1940s, but for many Americans, they are still a bit of a mystery. That's why we reached out to Tim Uzar, the founder of Ecomech Geothermal Heating and Air. \"This is a geothermal heat pump,\" Uzar said. While that sounds like a mouthful, because of new government tax breaks, homeowners may want to pay attention.A heat pump, generally, cools your home when it's hot outside and warms your home when it's cold.In the summer, it works by taking hot air out of your house and replacing it with cool air.In the winter, it pumps in the air that has been warmed from the outside.Heat pumps can be air-sourced or ground-sourced. Geothermal heat pumps are ground-sourced \u2014 storing and moving heat from deep underground. \"That's all we do is move heat from one space to another,\" Uzar says. Heat pumps are in the news because the new tax credit taking effect on Jan. 1 makes installing heat pumps and other energy-efficient upgrades to your home more affordable. Some incentives are already in effect.That matters because heat pumps are often more expensive than traditional heating and air systems. \"It's about two and a half to three times more expensive,\" Uzar says. Once they are in, though, utility bills can go down.When asked much a heat pump saves a homeowner, Uzar said, \"Generally, 40-70%.\"\"You got to break an egg to make an omelet,\" Uzar added. Still, the installation sticker shock has prevented many homeowners from making the switch. Depending on the size and model, heat pumps range from $4,000 to $40,000. INFLATION REDUCTION ACT That is why you want to read up on the Inflation Reduction Act.For instance, low-income households can cover 100% of specific heat pumps.Moderate-income households can get 50% of the costs paid.That's potentially an $8,000 savings.If you are a higher-earning family, starting Jan. 1, a tax credit of up to $2,000 a year is available if you make any energy-efficient upgrade to your home.Uzar showed us a geothermal heat pump \u2014 the most expensive and energy-efficient model. A new 30% tax credit for this is in effect.\"That brings it down to a more swallowable number,\" Uzar said. If you are wondering why Washington and other governments worldwide are so interested in heat pumps, the answer is climate change.In one neighborhood south of Atlanta, heat pumps are the only type of heating and cooling allowed because they don't emit as much carbon dioxide. They also don't require an ugly box on the side of your house, like a traditional air conditioner. In Washington State, a new state law says all homes and apartments built after July must have them.Tim's advice to homeowners? Do some research.\"I do expect there to be more interest,\" Uzar says, referring to the tax changes.",

    "content": "Amanda Northrop/Vox; Getty Images SBF and EA, animal welfare and economic growth, and why we\u2019re running short of people. Roughly a year ago, I joined Future Perfect as its lead editor. The decision was a no-brainer for me. Where else could I be deeply involved in directing, editing, and occasionally writing stories about the most important yet undercovered topics in the world? Looking back on my first year through our most read stories in 2022, I can say that our coverage definitely hit important subjects, but not always ones that were undercovered. That\u2019s because this was the year that effective altruism \u2014 the philosophical and philanthropic movement that helped inspire this section \u2014 went from background to foreground. First, earlier this year, new waves of money and a new focus on longtermism made EA as close to a household name as anything with roots in esoteric reaches of utilitarian philosophy can be. And then the source of much of that money \u2014 FTX co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried \u2014 saw his company collapse amid allegations of fraud that culminated in his arrest in the Bahamas earlier this month. (Disclosure: This August, Bankman-Fried\u2019s philanthropic family foundation, Building a Stronger Future, awarded Vox\u2019s Future Perfect a grant for a 2023 reporting project. That project is now on pause.) But if EA itself was the single biggest story Future Perfect covered this year, it was far from the only one. From the lingering effects of the Covid-19 pandemic to the mysteries of economic growth to the fate of billions of farm animals, our most read stories in 2022 hit every corner of Future Perfect\u2019s interests. 1) \u201cSam Bankman-Fried tries to explain himself\u201d by Kelsey Piper This story from mid-November \u2014 a late-night interview conducted by Twitter DMs with perhaps the most newsworthy person of 2022 \u2014 wasn\u2019t just the most read story on Future Perfect. It was the most read story of the year on Vox, period. Though Bankman-Fried would go on to conduct a wide-ranging and legally baffling media tour in the weeks that followed his company\u2019s shocking implosion, he would never be as candid as he was to Kelsey, answering questions on what went wrong and what he was thinking. It\u2019s hard to pick the most eyebrow-raising answer, but I\u2019ll go with this one, in response to a question about the real motivations behind his pre-collapse campaign to beef up cryptocurrency regulations: \u201cFuck regulators. They make everything worse.\u201d 2) \u201cThe incredible shrinking future of college\u201d by Kevin Carey Supply and demand are the twin forces that rule our world. And for decades, the American higher education system benefited from both \u2014 a generally rising supply of college-age young people, and growing demand for the benefits of a college degree. But as Kevin Carey of New America wrote in this November piece from Future Perfect\u2019s edition of The Highlight, colleges are grappling with an existential turnaround in both supply and demand. Demographic shifts mean that the number of college-age Americans will continually dwindle, while the declining economic value of the average college degree is denting demand, especially among men. That means we\u2019ll likely see college after college vanish in the years ahead, with grim implications for the small towns that depend on them. 3) \u201cOmicron is exploding. Here\u2019s what to do if you\u2019ve been exposed.\u201d by Sigal Samuel It says something about how long the Covid-19 pandemic has been with us that I was almost surprised to see this story from early January in our number three spot. But omicron, which only began spreading in the US a little more than a year ago, took the pandemic to an entirely new level. While vaccines still provided robust protection against hospitalization and death, especially for younger people, they were far less effective against infection \u2014 which made the tips Sigal highlighted in this story incredibly valuable. 4) \u201cAI experts are increasingly afraid of what they\u2019re creating\u201d by Kelsey Piper When we look back on 2022 in 10 or 15 or 20 years\u2019 time, we may decide that the most important topic of the year wasn\u2019t inflation or the Ukraine war or, god forbid, Elon Musk buying Twitter, but rather the astounding developments that occurred this year in the field of artificial intelligence, as ChatGPT became the first AI language product to really hit the masses. That, of course, assumes we\u2019ll still be around in 10 or 15 or 20 years\u2019 time. In this piece from Future Perfect\u2019s November Highlight edition, Kelsey explained why some of the people who best understand the bleeding edge of AI are also the people who are more worried about what their creation may do. 5) \u201c22 things we think will happen in 2022\u201d by Dylan Matthews, Kelsey Piper, and Sigal Samuel When the name of your section is Future Perfect, predictions about the future are hard to avoid. But we\u2019ve made it an annual habit at the start of the year not just to put our divination in writing, but to append probabilities to those forecasts \u2014 and to check back in a year\u2019s time to see how we\u2019ve done. We think this epistemic honesty should be less unusual in our line of work. You can look later this week for our piece reviewing how those predictions turned out, but let me just say that I hope that Dylan \u2014 who was relatively sure Kenneth Branagh\u2019s quickly forgotten film Belfast would win Best Picture at the Academy Awards this year \u2014 didn\u2019t wager his salary at the office Oscar pool. 6) \u201cHow the Fed ended the last great American inflation \u2014 and how much it hurt\u201d by Dylan Matthews 2022 will be remembered as the year that the long-vanquished demon of inflation came roaring back with a vengeance. In fact, it had been so long since rising prices were a major drag on the US economy that Dylan had to go back decades to find the last time the Federal Reserve had to take extreme measures to curb inflation. (How long ago? Then-Fed Chair Paul Volcker is depicted in the story\u2019s main photo smoking a cigar while testifying to Congress.) There\u2019s a lot to learn from this piece, but here\u2019s my main takeaway: The policy cure to runaway inflation is only slightly better than the disease. 7) \u201cAbout 200 years ago, the world started getting rich. Why?\u201d by Dylan Matthews At Future Perfect, we like our stories to take a wide scope, but it\u2019s not every piece that begins 300,000 years ago, as Homo sapiens began our long, slow crawl to the top of the planetary food chain. How we got here is, at root, the story of economic growth, and like a ponderous movie with a fantastic climax, it really only takes off in the last few pages. In an interview in June with the economists Jared Rubin and Mark Koyama, the authors of the excellent economic history How the World Became Rich, Dylan explored the story of what changed around 200 years ago, when, after millennia of little more than flat lines, economic growth skyrocketed. And in doing so, it did more than anything else to make the world we live in today. 8) \u201cCostco\u2019s inflation-proof $4.99 rotisserie chicken, explained\u201d by Kenny Torrella Call me an out-of-touch East Coast elite, but I\u2019ve never actually had Costco\u2019s famous $4.99 rotisserie chicken (though I did get a steady supply of Costco diapers and baby wipes delivered during my son\u2019s infancy). Turns out it\u2019s a whole thing \u2014 it even has its own Facebook fan page. But in a penetrating story in July, Kenny showed how Costco\u2019s dirt-cheap chicken \u2014 purposely sold at a loss to get customers through the door \u2014 is a symbol of an industrialized food system that damages the environment, harms workers, and causes untold suffering to farm animals, all in the name of a low-cost dinner. 9) \u201cHow you can get free N95 masks from the US government\u201d by Muizz Akhtar How intense was the fear around the omicron variant a year ago? Strong enough that a straightforward explainer from January about how to get the free N95 masks the Biden administration was providing easily made our top 15 for the year. Though 400 million masks were made available, as the omicron wave waned and vaccines held up against death, fewer and fewer of them were put to use. That may not be the case for much longer, though \u2014 earlier this month, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention once again encouraged Americans to wear masks in crowded indoor areas, this time to protect themselves and others against the tridemic of Covid, flu, and RSV. 10) \u201cA study gave cash and therapy to men at risk of criminal behavior. 10 years later, the results are in.\u201d by Sigal Samuel Violent crime returned as a social scourge during the pandemic, though for some parts of the world, like the West African nation of Liberia, it never left. But while American politicians were debating gun laws and sentencing practices, the University of Chicago economist Chris Blattman was hard at work on another option: offering direct cash benefits and targeted therapy to men in Liberia who were most at risk of violent behavior. Research published by Blattman and his colleagues in May found that these twin interventions reduced the future risk of crime and violence, with effects still seen 10 years after the fact. Blattman is now at work importing those practices to Chicago, where more than 600 people were killed in 2022. 11) \u201cHumanity was stagnant for millennia \u2014 then something big changed 150 years ago\u201d by Dylan Matthews How\u2019s this for an opening line: \u201cThe 140 years from 1870 to 2010 of the long twentieth century were, I strongly believe, the most consequential years of all humanity\u2019s centuries.\u201d It comes from the brilliant book Slouching Towards Utopia: An Economic History of the Twentieth Century by historian Brad DeLong, whom Dylan interviewed for this piece in September. The conversation is full of fascinating historical nuggets, like the fact that the average number of years that a woman spent either pregnant or breastfeeding declined from 20 in 1870 to just four today. Collected together, they make a compelling case that the turbocharged economic growth that began in the late 19th century fundamentally changed human life for the better, though not without caveats. It\u2019s a fact that we, living in the aftermath of DeLong\u2019s long 20th century, too often fail to appreciate. 12) \u201cThe Supreme Court is about to decide the fate of millions of pigs\u201d by Kenny Torrella It wasn\u2019t the most historic case on the Supreme Court\u2019s docket this past year, but few legal battles have ever affected this many living beings. As Kenny described in his piece from October, National Pork Producers Council v. Ross \u201chinges on a simple question: Can California set its own standards for how pigs are treated on farms, even when they\u2019re raised in other states?\u201d Yet the legal questions that were argued before the Court went to the heart of what the meat industry should be permitted to do to the millions of pigs on its farms \u2014 and what individual states are allowed to do to change that often horrific system. We won\u2019t know the Court\u2019s ruling until next year, but we know its decision will resonate from farm all the way to table. 13) \u201cPoor countries are developing a new paradigm of mental health care. America is taking note.\u201d by Sigal Samuel A default question behind both international news coverage and international philanthropy is this: What can rich nations do to help poor nations? But in this November story from Future Perfect\u2019s edition of the Highlight, Sigal turns the question on its head. Like the US, many nations in the Global South are suffering through mental health crises, a problem compounded by the fact that they have far fewer mental health professionals per capita than rich nations. But, as Sigal shows, the future of sustainable mental health care could take the form of the kind of community-based approaches being pioneered in countries like Ghana, featuring a \u201ctherapy that teaches people the skills to devise their own solutions to the problems they face.\u201d 14) \u201cAmericans keep moving to where the water isn\u2019t\u201d by Bryan Walsh Hey, I know that guy! I was inspired to write this story in August by a simple question: Why, as the effects of climate change like heat waves and droughts became ever more apparent, do Americans keep moving to those parts of the country most vulnerable to warming? Ten of the 15 US counties that saw the most population growth in 2021 were in the water-starved Southwest, while the 50 US counties with the least vulnerability to climate change lost more people than they gained. As it turns out, the desire for relatively cheap housing, a robust local economy, and as many weeks of sunshine as you can find outweighs climate fears for most Americans, in a perfect illustration of what economists would call \u201crevealed preferences.\u201d 15) \u201cThe great population growth slowdown\u201d by Bryan Walsh This story from January was the first one I published on Future Perfect, and it just made the top 15. (Maybe I should have quit while I was ahead.) It was also the first of several I wrote this year about what I believe is one of the most important trends facing the US and the world: slowing population growth. As I noted, the US population grew by just 0.1 percent in the year between July 2020 and July 2021 \u2014 the lowest growth rate in the nation\u2019s history. There are multiple explanations, but they boil down to this: fewer people having fewer babies, and, in the US at least, fewer immigrants arriving on our shores. Both trends have improved a bit over the past year, which I\u2019d argue is welcome news. Slow population growth is a recipe for economic sluggishness and cultural sclerosis. And if you\u2019d like to know more, you can read the 4,568 words I published on the subject in November.",

    "description": "The airline canceled 70% of its flights Monday, and the feds want to know why.",
    "content": "NEW YORK - Southwest Airlines is under fire after a stunning amount of passengers were left stranded.\u00a0 The airline canceled 70% of its flights Monday, and the feds want to know why.\u00a0 At LaGuardia Airport, passengers were sleeping on benches overnight. It was a clear sign that the holiday travel nightmare is far from over.\u00a0 According to FlightAware.com, more than 60 Southwest Airlines flights were already canceled from LaGuardia Airport for the day as of early Tuesday morning - that number could rise.\u00a0 It's leaving thousands of customers stranded with very limited options of getting out of town.\u00a0 For nearly 4,000 Southwest Airlines flights nationwide Monday, it's like a bad Christmas gift that keeps on giving.\u00a0 \"Just none of the turnstyles are going, and there is luggage all the way to the wall, and tons of people,\" said Southwest customer Aggie Bothwell.\u00a0 Much of that frustration aimed at the more than 70% of flights that were canceled. The airline says they were fully prepared staffing-wise heading into the holiday weekend, but bad weather across the country led to operational challenges.\u00a0 \"We walked in at five this morning, and it was crazy,\" travelers Susan and Rick Biegler said.\u00a0 \"People were on the phone to call in, like, four hours, and still did not get an answers,\" said traveler Patricia Mammenga.\u00a0 Southwest employees also showed their frustration amid the chaos.\u00a0 I\u2019m tracking closely & will have more to say about this tomorrow. https://t.co/qIRh9ymusT\u2014 Secretary Pete Buttigieg (@SecretaryPete) December 27, 2022 The U.S. Department of Transportation said in a tweet that it's \"concerned about Southwest's unacceptable rate of cancellations and delays & reports of a lack of prompt customer service.\"\u00a0 Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg says he's tracking the issue and will make an announcement Tuesday.\u00a0 It's a turbulent ride, and everyone wants off.\u00a0 \"I was on hold with Southwest for about an hour-and-a-half and there was no communication on what was happening,\" said traveler Heather Smith.\u00a0 In baggage claim, luggage stacked up, left unclaimed throughout the area.\u00a0 \"Flight got canceled last night. It got canceled again today. And now we're just kind of over it and we're going to head back home,\" said traveler Ben Rodriguez.\u00a0 Unfortunately, it looks like those issues will continue through Tuesday, with more than 60 flights at LaGuardia canceled as of early Tuesday morning.\u00a0 Travelers stranded at Newark Liberty International Airport 01:28 For more information:\u00a0 FAA Flight Delay InformationTSA Travel TipsLaGuardia Airport (LGA): DelaysDeparturesArrivalsJohn F.

I'm approaching 4,000 students in my career,\" she said.She currently teaches 10th grade history at East Orange STEM Academy.\"Ms. Maughan has been the epitome of what education and teaching looks like on a daily, consistent basis,\" Principal Vincent Stallings said.\"I couldn't think of a better person to receive this award. She is an exemplary and phenomenal educator,\" said Shay Richardson, social studies supervisor for the East Orange School District. Maughan recently received the Horace Mann Award, one of public education's top honors.\"It helps people to see urban school districts have great things that are happening within,\" she said.The award recognizes teachers for their leadership inside and outside the classroom, a quality Maughan shares she holds close to her heart.\"I am blessed that teaching is my passion work ... Receiving this recognition at this point in my life, I think it's just confirmed the idea that I try to get better each year,\" she said.Maughan was born in Belize. Shortly after her family immigrated to Jersey City and when they faced deportation, it was her sixth grade teacher who stepped in, helping them with the naturalization process and preventing their deportation. Since then, she says she knew what she wanted to do with her life:\u00a0 teach.\"I hope to inspire my children not to defer their dreams, that you keep pursuing it and you do it for the love of what you're doing,\" Maughan said.\"She is an exemplary educator, but not only is she this for the scholars, but with her ability to share with her colleagues and build them up is what makes her all the more greater,\" Richardson said.\u00a0Maughan says she hopes her success story inspires none other than her students.\"Each one of them has really contributed to making me the person I am today,\" she said.",

    "content": "While the broader crypto market consolidates over $800 billion market cap, some altcoins make a strong move. Terra Classic (LUNC) jumped nearly 16% on Monday and is one of the top-performing altcoins for the month of December. Just ahead of the end of this year 2022, the broader crypto market continues to hover at around $800 billion market cap. While Bitcoin continues to stay over $16,800 levels, a few other altcoins have registered strong moves in recent times. Altcoins like The Graph, Litecoin, Internet Computer and Terra Classic have outperformed the market recently. Let\u2019s take a look at each of them individually. The Graph Blockchain network The Graph allows developers to quickly search, index, use and publish the data from other public blockchains. Two years since its inception, The Graph continues to see strong network growth. Over the last year, the total number of developers for The Graph Network skyrocketed up by 145% to 38,000. In the same timeframe, the average GRT query fees also surged by 1,191% to 354,000. Similarly, total subgraphs and proxies for the applications have jumped by 122% to 641 on the decentralized network. Since the launch of The Graph Network two years back, it has onboarded a total of over 200 indexers, 10,000 delegators, and 2,500 curators. On Monday, December 26, GRT, the native cryptocurrency of The Graph jumped by 10% moving past $0.060. Currently, the price of GRT is trading at $0.05981. Litecoin (LTC) This altcoin has a strong show throughout the entire month of December 2022 spurred by strong whale activity. On Monday, December 26, the LTC price surged more than 10% in a fresh attempt to break past the resistance of $72.50. Since the 2022-low of under $45, the Litecoin (LTC) price has gained more than 72% so far and is currently trading at a crucial junction. If LTC breaks the resistance of $72.50, it can subsequently hit the targets of $78, $84 and $100 as well. #Litecoin shows strength, and probably will continue to show strength. I'm interested in the $69 range for some scalp trades. Further, primarily, looking for an option around $66.75 for longs, then targeting $78 and $84 next. pic.twitter.com/cVB0F3NTLh \u2014 Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) December 26, 2022 Over the last week, Litecoin (LTC) witnessed over $500 million worth of inflows as the market jumped from $4.55 billion seven days ago to $5.05 billion. We have just four days left to bid adieu to 2022 and well, we cannot rule out the possibility of a strong market rally going ahead. Internet Computer (ICP) Internet Computer (ICP) is yet another altcoin that has been on investors\u2019 radar recently and has made good gains of over 10% over the last week. As of press time, ICP the native crypto is trading 1% up at $3.92. The Internet Computer blockchain project caters to one of the most thriving industries of Metaverse. It is also the metaverse project with the highest market cap in the market. The ICP has outperformed some of the biggest crypto metaverse projects such as The Sandbox and Axie Infinity. Top 10 #Metaverse Coins by Market Capitalization\ud83d\udc49 https://t.co/Jb9xRHfJSy@TheSandboxGame $SAND @AxieInfinity $AXS @decentraland $MANA @enjin $ENJ @RenderToken $RNDR $MC @RealFlokiInu $FLOKI @Treasure_DAO $MAGIC $ICP $ILV pic.twitter.com/tKy88QGA4I \u2014 Ben GCrypto (@GCryptoBen) December 21, 2022 Metaverse Projects are likely to gather more steam as we head into 2023. Thus, Internet Computer (ICP) project might continue to stay on investors\u2019 radar for the next year as well and we can see more price action for ICP. Terra Classic (LUNC) On Monday, December 26, the price of Terra Classic (LUNC) surged by more than 10% after 25% gains already over the last week. The recent rally in LUNC comes as Terra Classic core developers Edward Kim and Tobias \u201cZaradar\u201d Anderson formed a new group \u201cJoint L1 Task Force\u201d. Besides, Kim also shared the first proposal by the group to work on Layer-1 Terra Classic blockchain developments. Currently, the LUNC price is trading 15.27% up at $0.0001796. Another major reason behind the LUNC price rally is the massive burn by validators and other Terra Classic projects. In recent times, the total LUNC burned has surpassed more than 36.5 billion tokens. The Terra Classic community burnt 80 million LUNC alone in December this month.

    "description": "When you create a New Year\u2019s Resolution this year consider joining a group.",
    "content": "We have an embarrassing confession: our New Year\u2019s resolutions for 2023 are nearly identical to the resolutions we made for 2022 (which were remarkably similar to 2021, 2020, and pretty much every year as far as we can remember). A year ago, we held such lofty ambitions. We would exercise more, use social media less, rise earlier, read more books, eat healthier, write more, reduce our carbon footprint, learn to meditate\u2026. We started strong. But a few weeks in, as January\u2019s cold morphed into the slushy days of February, our resolve slackened. Twitter reappeared on our phones and we doomscrolled late into the evening. Our warm beds seemed to grip us tighter when the alarm went off for our morning jogs. We began to hit snooze, once, twice, then three times. And, well, meditation never had a hope. [time-brightcove not-tgx=\u201dtrue\u201d] We had largely failed. Will this stop us from doing the same thing this New Year\u2019s? Absolutely not. But we have learned to approach our New Year\u2019s resolutions in an entirely different way and we think you should too. As the calendar turns from one year to the next, millions of people will resolve to reinvent themselves. On scraps of wrapping paper, crumpled napkins, or in fancy notebooks bought just for the occasion, we will engage in the annual collective ritual of listing the ways that we will, this year, be better. And yet, by some estimates, as many as 80% of people fail to keep their New Year\u2019s resolutions by February. Only 8% of people stick with them the entire year. Given this less than stellar track record, it is worth asking, what would we do if we were serious? What would we do differently if we really did want to stick to our resolutions for more than a few weeks? Psychologists who study self-control have advice about how best to stick to our goals. The worst approaches involve what they call \u201cresponse modulation\u201d\u2014otherwise known as white-knuckling it as you stare down temptation. Good old will power. The ancient Greeks knew that this was a terrible strategy, as evidenced by their myths. As Odysseus approached the Sirens, whose songs would lure men to their deaths, he plugged the ears of his crew and had himself bound to the mast of his ship. Odysseus knew that confronting temptation without a plan would fail sooner or later. Instead, he adopted a strategy that present-day psychologists call \u201csituation change.\u201d This is, according to a review of 102 studies, the best strategy for exerting self-control. Rather than exposing ourselves to temptations and hoping we possess the willpower to resist, it is better to avoid confronting them in the first place. The Lord\u2019s Prayer asks God not to lead us into temptation. Situation change takes matters into our own hands. Dieters remove all the sugary foods from their kitchens. Recovering doom scrollers delete the social media apps from their phones. Aspiring writers block off time for writing on their calendars just as if it was an important meeting during which they must not be disturbed. Just as importantly, situation change involves paying close attention to our social circumstances. The people around us and the groups we belong to have a substantial influence on behavior\u2014influence that can be leveraged to help achieve our goals There is one exception to our lists of unfulfilled resolutions, one area in which we have been successful: writing more. When we embarked on writing our first book together a few years ago, we thought carefully about how to structure our social environments to propel us through what could otherwise become a dreary trudge of 300 pages. We set weekly meetings, blocking off time to write together. We met in caf\u00e9s to argue over stories, studies, and turns of phrase. Working together created both social accountability and social support. More generally, we leveraged the power of groups by joining writing groups where we set goals together and meet each month. Groups help people achieve their goals by setting social norms and creating a sense of accountability. In our case, we have joined writing groups in which we set goals together with other people. Really together. Each member writes their goals in a shared document and reads them aloud each meeting to make it transparent that all of us are constantly prioritizing our writing. Knowing that other people expect us to stick to our goals helps us make writing a priority when other distractions or temptations appear. But new research by David Kalkstein, Cayce Hook, and colleagues suggests that norms don\u2019t simply change behavior because people conform in an effort to please others. Rather, norms may limit the behavioral options that even come to mind. Drawing on one of their evocative examples, imagine that you\u2019re at dinner with a coworker. With your diet in mind, you are finishing the meal with a small espresso, while they indulge in a delectable slice of cake. As you ruefully sip your drink, what are the chances you reach across and help yourself to a spoonful of their dessert? What are the odds that the idea of doing so even comes to mind? Near zero in both cases (at least in our experience). Everything changes, of course, if your colleague provides you the option. \u201cThis is far too much for me; would you like to share?\u201d Immediately, you confront a self-control challenge you didn\u2019t face before: stick to your diet or indulge? Putting this idea to the test, the researchers tested whether creating a norm against using technology (phones and laptops) in class would help university students be less tempted to engage in counterproductive multitasking while listening to lectures. In one version of a course, the teacher showed students evidence that multitasking reduces learning and established a social norm of not using technology. In another version of the same course, the teacher provided the same evidence and had students create a personal plan for not using technology in class. Norms trumped personal plans. On average, students whose resolutions not to use technology were independent reported spending 24% of their time in class multitasking. For students in the course with a clear social norm against tech, it was a mere 10! Importantly, people who were in a group with healthier social norms also reported fewer urges to engage with their phone or computer during class. Tempting thoughts came less frequently to mind. The need for sheer willpower was lessened. So when you create a New Year\u2019s Resolution this year consider joining a group. Whether you are at home or at work, think more deeply about how your good intentions can be supported (or undermined) by groups and their norms. You might form a running group with friends, start a book club with coworkers, join a local environmental organization, or attend regular meditation meet-ups. Of course, there is also the possibility that some of the groups you belong to have norms that contradict the goal you have set for yourself. If you want to reduce your alcohol consumption, for instance, you might need to avoid hanging out with your drinking buddies. Spend a little less time in their company and more in the presence of people whose own behaviors align with your intentions. This is how our groups can help us become the best version of ourselves.",

    "description": "A drumbeat of bad news and bad decisions is reducing Trump\u2019s standing within the GOP.",
    "content": "Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign is off to a brutally rocky start. In the weeks since announcing his third campaign for President, Trump\u2019s faced a historic criminal referral from the House Jan. 6 Committee, his company was found guilty of tax fraud, and his hand-picked Senate candidate in Georgia lost a winnable seat. But that\u2019s not all. Trump also called for the \u201ctermination\u201d of the Constitution in a social media post, and was met with disgust after his dinner at his Mar-a-Lago Club with white supremacist Nick Fuentes and antisemitic rapper Kanye West. The drumbeat of bad news and bad decisions has reduced Trump\u2019s favorability rating to 31 percent of voters, the lowest it\u2019s been since 2015, the year he declared his first presidential run after riding down an escalator at Trump Tower, according to a Quinnipiac University national poll released this month. [time-brightcove not-tgx=\u201dtrue\u201d] And Trump hasn\u2019t done much to reverse the slump. He\u2019s rarely left his Mar-a-Lago home since launching the campaign on Nov. 15, and hasn\u2019t hosted any other major campaign events or attended rallies that might have helped keep his momentum going. \u201cWhat campaign? No rallies. No infrastructure that I can see,\u201d says Larry Sabato, a prominent political analyst and director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia. His campaign website in late December listed no information about future events or his political platform. Visitors to the site saw a popup window requesting an email and cell phone number, which then sent them to a video of Trump encouraging supporters to \u201cget on line, donate, sign up, take action, volunteer, get organized, talk to your neighbors.\u201d Visitors were then directed to a fundraising page, and a link to a shop selling Trump 2024 campaign swag, including flags, T-shirts, wrapping paper featuring Trump in a Santa hat, and an ornament in the shape of a red baseball cap reading, \u201cTrump Save America.\u201d Trump is still the most potent force in GOP politics, but polls show that his support among Republicans is beginning to soften. The share of Republicans who see Trump favorably dropped to 64% in December, according to a USA TODAY/Suffolk University Poll, down from 75% two months earlier. More Republicans are open to other candidates as well. The same poll found that 61% of Republicans prefer a GOP candidate other than Trump who would pursue the policies from the Trump Administration. Thirty-one percent of Republicans want Trump to run in 2024, the poll found. So far, Trump\u2019s campaign is \u201cdisjointed, haphazard, unfocused, and still focused on the past, and his grievances, rather than the future, which is what attracted a lot of Republicans to him in 2015,\u201d says Whit Ayres, a Republican pollster. Nonetheless, Trump still has a grip on a meaningful slice of his party\u2019s base. According to polling Ayres conducted with North Star Opinion Research, about 30% to 40% of GOP voters fall into what Ayres describes as being \u201calways Trump,\u201d people who say they will support Trump no matter what. That is a strong base from which to wage a Republican primary campaign, Ayres says. Yet Trump\u2019s poor showing thus far has opened the door for potential challengers in a GOP primary, including Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin, who are being encouraged to run by deep-pocketed Republican donors disenchanted with Trump. DeSantis won reelection in Florida by nearly 20 percentage points, a much wider margin than Trump\u2019s win over Joe Biden in the state in 2020 and over Hillary Clinton there in 2016. Youngkin has won support from conservatives for passing tax cuts in Virginia and working to restrict what flexibility schools have to approach transgender and gender-fluid students. And unlike Trump, potential contenders like DeSantis and Youngkin have the advantage of still being in office over the next year, giving them better opportunities to get the attention of GOP voters through policy wins and responding to current events. The bad news for Trump isn\u2019t likely to let up anytime soon. Attorney General Merrick Garland responded to Trump\u2019s campaign announcement last month by naming special counsel Jack Smith to take over investigations into the role Trump played in trying to overturn his 2020 election loss, as well as Trump\u2019s mishandling of classified documents after he left office. And the investigation in Georgia by Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis into Trump\u2019s effort to press officials to change vote tallies is continuing to call witnesses from Trump\u2019s circle. On Dec. 23, the House Jan. 6 Committee released a final report that contained reams of pages of damning testimony and evidence showing Trump trying to advance a slate of fake electors to block Biden\u2019s win, and refusing to intervene as his supporters violently stormed the Capitol Building to stop the certification of the results. Some Republican leaders have become more willing to criticize Trump in public in recent weeks, perhaps emboldened by failure of a Republican wave to materialize in the midterm elections, which showed the limits of Trump\u2019s political clout. When Trump posted on his social media website TruthSocial that election fraud allows for the \u201ctermination\u201d of articles of the Constitution, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said such a statement would disqualify him from the Oval Office. \u201cAnyone seeking the presidency who thinks that the Constitution could somehow be suspended or not followed, it seems to me would have a very hard time being sworn in as President of the United States,\u201d McConnell told reporters on Dec. 6. Last week, McConnell continued to ding Trump, telling NBC News, \u201cthe former President\u2019s political clout has diminished.\u201d The weakening support for Trump among Republicans could be temporary. \u201cHe\u2019s bounced back before,\u201d Sabato says, adding that when \u201cthe pragmatic part of the party realizes how much he\u2019s cost them, they pull back, but these same people will go with the flow\u201d if Trump appears to be taking a clear lead against other candidates in the Republican primary. On Dec. 14, Trump ignited speculation that he was about to make a move that would reignite some momentum for his presidential bid. He posted that he\u2019d be making a \u201cmajor announcement,\u201d prompting speculation he had a major move planned related to his effort to win back the White House. The next day, Trump released a series of digital artworks of himself as nonfungible tokens, or NFTs, selling for $99 each. The profits went to Trump, not his campaign. A few days later, on Dec. 20, there was another sign of possible movement on the political front. A fundraising appeal from Trump\u2019s 2024 campaign touted a contest for a flight and hotel to attend Trump\u2019s first rally since his presidential announcement. But the notice didn\u2019t say where or when.",

    "content": "Enlarge (credit: Aurich Lawson | Getty Images) Ah, the annual end-of-year roundup, when it's time to sit down and think about all the vehicles we tested in 2022. Comparing this year to years past, it's notable how many electric vehicles make the list. Partly that's because the industry released some pretty compelling new EVs this year, but it's also a reflection of our coverage priorities\u2014in the past, you've told us loud and clear you aren't that interested in reading about new gasoline or diesel models. Read on to find out what impressed us most in 2022. 1. Kia EV6 Fun to drive and extremely efficient, the EV6 is an outstanding EV. (credit: Jonathan Gitlin) Our winner is actually one of the first cars we tested this year, and it's the Kia EV6. It uses a new 800 V EV architecture called E-GMP, shared with last year's winner, the Hyundai Ioniq 5, that delivers impressive levels of efficiency for larger, heavier EVs while also boasting some of the best fast-charging in the industry\u2014just 18 minutes from 10-80 percent on a 350 kW charger. Despite the shared roots, the Kia drives very differently compared to the angular Ioniq 5, with a sportier nature. And unlike the Hyundai, the EV6 is sold in all 50 states. Sadly, Kia dropped the cheapest configuration from the roster this year\u2014the $40,900 EV6 Light used a smaller battery and motor but only accounted for about 3 percent of customer orders, according to the company. Earlier this month, we got a chance to test the other end of the spectrum\u2014the $61,400 EV6 GT, which is very fast but might just be overkill.Read 22 remaining paragraphs | Comments",

    "content": "A Pacific Gas and Electric Co. worker moves a wire into place while installing a bypass switch in Yountville, California, in April 2020. The\u00a0California Public Utilities Commission\u00a0has proposed requiring large investor-owned utilities to speed up the deployment of microgrids and other so-called resiliency projects to minimize the impacts of wildfire-induced outages and power shut-offs. | David Paul Morris/Bloomberg via Getty Images The US can tackle methane emissions and deliver on global financing. 2022 delivered a sobering wake-up call of how much work is left to address the climate crisis. Flooding in Pakistan, Nigeria, and Indonesia killed thousands of people, drought affected millions of people in Somalia and China, and unusually severe heat waves settled over Europe and most of the US. But we keep moving in the wrong direction. Global emissions from fossil fuel combustion and coal use hit another all-time high, triggered by resumed Covid travel and geopolitical unrest. As UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres said in his year-end remarks, the world\u2019s mutual goal of limiting rising temperatures to 1.5 degrees Celsius \u201cis gasping for breath.\u201d There\u2019s much more that can be done in 2023, and the US has a particular role to play. Historically the world\u2019s biggest polluter, the US is finally gearing up for its biggest realignment yet on climate change. The country has a chance to slash its climate pollution and protect the population from the effects of extreme weather. And there are also actionable steps people can take in their own lives and communities to make a difference. Here are five things the US could resolve to do in 2023: 1) Slash methane emissions from the oil and gas sector Next year has the opportunity to be a turning point in the second-biggest contributor to climate change, methane. Methane is responsible for only 30 percent of climate change, a smaller share than carbon dioxide, but it is also much more capable of trapping heat. Methane is also unique because it isn\u2019t just a byproduct of burning fossil fuels, it is the fuel natural gas. All these factors make methane a particularly alarming climate problem, but one that is solvable in the short-term. Methane concentrations in the atmosphere reached a new peak in 2021, and are rising faster than ever. This is a problem that the US has unusual control over, because it is home to some of the world\u2019s worst superemitters. The place to start is in the oil and gas operations in the Permian Basin, a ticking time bomb of methane emissions that\u2019s worsening climate change. The Biden administration has a handful of different rules to finalize next year that target this problem. Two of them come from the EPA and the Bureau of Land Management, aimed at reducing the wasted gas oil and gas producers are letting vent or burn into the atmosphere. The EPA would require companies to regularly monitor pollution coming from their oil and gas wells, as well as limit companies from burning off the excess gas. And the Bureau of Land Management rule specifically targets public and tribal lands by setting monthly limits on burning off excess gas and having operators submit a waste minimization plan with any permit application. Mario Tama/Getty Images In an aerial view, some pumpjacks operate while others stand idle in the Belridge oil field on near McKittrick, California, in November 2021. In California, 35,000 oil and gas wells sit idle, many of which are unplugged and could leak methane gas. Another major change will be the Inflation Reduction Act\u2019s methane fee. The fee technically doesn\u2019t kick in until 2024, but next year will be key to figuring out its enforcement. The law charges oil and gas operators $900 per metric ton of methane that is released, and will scale up to $1,500 by 2026. None of these rules will mean much without proper monitoring and enforcement. But next year will also finally be a game changer in delivering better real-time data on the worst polluting offenders. A fleet of satellites, run by NASA and groups like Carbon Mapper and Environmental Defense Fund, will be up and running to capture exactly where the methane is coming from. It will provide the world\u2019s first check on whether companies, and governments, are actually meeting the lofty pledges they\u2019ve made on tackling methane emissions. 2. Mainstream heat pumps, induction stoves, and electric vehicles with the Inflation Reduction Act The Inflation Reduction Act passed by Democrats in Congress this summer includes $369 billion to push American consumers and industry away from relying on fossil fuels. The utility payments in the law will ensure that renewables will be cheaper than building new coal and gas power plants. And the tax credits and rebates aim at helping consumers make the leap to renewable and energy-efficient technologies. Some of these technologies are familiar, like rooftop solar and insulation, but some will be newer to Americans, including heat pumps, induction stoves, and plug-in electric vehicles. The law will help lower the costs of the machines for some Americans by thousands of dollars. So next year, hopefully the same products become mainstream. The mainstreaming of heat pumps and induction stoves will depend in large part on the implementation of the IRA\u2019s incentives, along with successful marketing to consumers. Within the Biden administration, agencies will be responsible for coming up with the rules and guidance to oversee the billions of dollars available under the law. The White House also has a dedicated site to unpacking the consumer credits available. But implementation will also depend on states, which are responsible for distributing most of the law\u2019s programs. For example, it will be up to states to carry out the law\u2019s investments in cleaning up abandoned oil wells and rebate programs, and other programs like training contractors in the newest energy-efficient technology. 3. Take extreme heat as seriously as the cold We learned some important lessons about the power grid this year. After repeated close calls around the country this year during high demand times, California and Texas narrowly averted mass power outages only when consumers helped to reduce the load on the grid, through small actions like changing the thermostat. These events averted mass blackouts during unusual heat waves. If the power did go out, millions could have been exposed to potentially dangerous temperatures. Everyone has different tolerances to heat, and in a heat wave, the elderly tend to be the most vulnerable well before the thermostat hits triple digits. But heat tends to get overlooked in US policy response, even as it becomes a bigger and likelier catastrophe from climate change. Historically, the US has managed to do better when it comes to helping people get through the winter. The vast majority of states have policies that forbid power shutoffs during a winter freeze. Most states also require heating for multifamily homes. But policy governing cooling in the summers is a patchwork that lets the most vulnerable slip through the cracks. Federal buildings, housing, and prisons have standards for heat, but no guarantee of AC. And only a handful of states have any kind of requirements that utilities keep the power on during a heat wave, according to data compiled by the Energy Justice Lab of Indiana University and shared with Vox. Kathryn Elsesser/AFP via Getty Images People rest at the Oregon Convention Center cooling station in Portland in June 2021, as a heatwave moved over much of the United States. The nation doesn\u2019t have an accurate picture of just what the lack of any coherent cooling strategy costs the public. Some low-income consumers have to choose between turning on the AC or buying food. For some, it means utilities have cut off their power for falling behind on an unpaid bill, even in life-threatening heat. There are reasonable policy measures that could prevent casualties in a heat wave. One is protecting people from having their electricity unexpectedly cut off due to an unpaid bill. Another is to ensure a stable power grid during a heat wave so the power doesn\u2019t go out, by investing in redundancy in the grid and investing in smart meters that communicate between the customer and the utility. These are small steps that finally take the heat as seriously as the cold. 4. Deliver on global climate financing The US still hasn\u2019t delivered on its original Paris climate agreement pledge in 2015 to deliver $3 billion to the Green Climate Fund. The fund is meant to help with clean energy financing in developing countries, in recognition of rich countries\u2019 lopsided blame for causing climate change. While Biden secured $1 billion from Congress this year, it\u2019s unclear where the remaining $2 billion will come from, especially given Republican control of the House next year. The US has other obligations on top of the Green Climate Fund. Biden also pledged $11 billion to developing countries. That\u2019s on top of the White House\u2019s announcements of joint energy partnerships with South Africa, Indonesia, Vietnam, and the EU. Some of this funding can come from agencies\u2019 discretionary budget, but Biden will need to depend on Congress for the rest. The US also has a new kind of climate commitment to deliver on. At the recent international climate conference in Egypt, the world committed for the first time to recognizing the loss and damages suffered by developing countries for a crisis they played a negligible role in creating. The US has long been wary of agreeing to pay for any losses and damages, worried it will open up a flood of lawsuits and claims against the world\u2019s historically biggest polluter, but did agree to a basic framework in Egypt. It\u2019s not clear yet what that will translate to in dollars. 5. Get personal and political In 2023, Americans will have more personal control over the kind of carbon footprint they have than ever before. They\u2019ll be able to take control over the \u201cmini fossil fuel plants\u201d people run in their homes every day for their heating, cooking, and driving. The incentives available under the Inflation Reduction Act will finally make it more financially affordable to go electric. There\u2019s money for rooftop solar; electric vehicles, clothes dryers, stoves, and ovens; heat pumps for heating, cooling, and hot water; electric panels and wiring. The law also includes programs that cover the costs of insulation and weatherization to cut a building\u2019s energy usage. Frederic J. Brown/AFP via Getty Images A driver charges his electric vehicle at a charging station in Monterey Park, California, in August. It\u2019s also important to get outside the mindset that the only impact you can have on climate change is in the ways you consume, eat, and live. There\u2019s more you can do. Action can mean thinking about your identities, your workplace, your networks, and your privileges, but also, a little more abstractly, understanding what sorts of action lead to policy change. All this will help you identify the appropriate community to link up with. In other words: You can always do more by not acting alone.",

    "content": "Sudeban, the Venezuelan banking watchdog, is currently working on a mechanism to review crypto-related transactions in real-time to control the influence these have on the stability of the exchange market. Analysts have recently linked the situation in peer-to-peer (P2P) crypto markets to the recent drop in the value of the bolivar. Venezuelan Government to Monitor Crypto Transactions The Venezuelan government is aiming to monitor the the movements of crypto-based P2P exchanges to protect the value of the bolivar. On Dec. 20, the Venezuelan banking watchdog Sudeban explained that it is in the process of designing a system to monitor banking transactions in real-time, with the help of Sunacrip, the national cryptocurrency regulator. While no more details were offered, the organization explained the objective is to \u201cfight the irregular practices that attack our currency and the stability of the exchange market.\u201d This means that the government looks to be examining the link between the volumes exchanged in cryptocurrency markets and the U.S. dollar \u2013 Venezuelan bolivar exchange rate. While the government has not stated explicitly there is a direct relation between these two variables, analysts have linked the recent cryptocurrency drought in peer-to-peer markets due to the collapse of FTX, to the sudden rise in the aforementioned exchange rate. However, this is also said to be mixed in with other causes, such as the natural abundance of fiat currency in the market due to holiday-related payments. Related to this measure, more than 75 bank accounts have been blocked due to suspicious activity related to cryptocurrency transactions since the end of 2021, according to Legalrocks, a national crypto-focused law firm. Devaluation and Inflation Cocktail This would be one of the \u201cdrastic\u201d measures that president Nicolas Maduro announced on Dec. 11 in order to subdue the devaluation of the bolivar, which has gone from 12.66 bolivars per dollar on Nov. 28, to almost 20 bolivars per dollar on Dec. 28. This follows another high devaluation period in November, which saw the bolivar lose 40% of its value. The behavior of the exchange rate has worried analysts, who are now examining the possible effects this will have on inflation rates for December and into next year. The country recently exited a period of hyperinflation that started in 2017 and lasted four years. Jose Guerra, a Venezuelan economist, predicts a 30% inflation rate for December. The Central Bank of Venezuela has not released official inflation numbers since October, registering an increase of 119.4% in prices during the first 10 months of 2022.

    "content": "Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ) smiles while talking to reporters after leaving the Senate chamber following a procedural vote on federal legislation protecting same-sex marriages in November. | Kent Nishimura/Los Angeles Times via Getty Images Three key questions to consider for 2024\u2019s Senate contest. Kyrsten Sinema, the country\u2019s newest independent senator, didn\u2019t exactly surprise Washington when she announced earlier this month that she was leaving the Democratic Party. Arizona\u2019s senior senator has had a long streak of bucking her old party\u2019s line, frustrating Democrats in her home state and in Congress, while befuddling pundits, constituents, and journalists about why she legislates the way she does. But her choice to go independent was shocking for many Arizonans, including some in the Arizona Democratic Party and former campaign volunteers and canvassers, who were expecting a drawn-out primary fight to ensue ahead of the 2024 general election, when Sinema\u2019s seat will be one of 23 Democrats have to defend to keep a Senate majority. Even before Sinema\u2019s announcement, Arizona\u2019s 2024 Senate contest was shaping up to be chaos: Potential Democratic challengers were mobilizing, and the state\u2019s Republican Party is in the throes of another civil war between its Trumpist, election-denying factions and conventional, business-friendly conservatives. Now, the prospect of a three-way Senate contest with a serious, well-funded independent incumbent during a potential Biden-Trump presidential rematch is almost hard to comprehend. But while most attention since Sinema\u2019s announcement has been on whether she would be a spoiler candidate for the Democrats or how angry people feel at her decision, there are a few other important questions to consider. Here are three of the most important. Will Kyrsten Sinema run at all? Whether Sinema runs again remains an open question. At the moment, she has taken the perfunctory step of filing a statement of candidacy with the Federal Election Commission to begin the campaign process, though she hasn\u2019t formally announced a reelection bid. A spokesperson for Sinema did not respond to a request for comment. Still, the conventional wisdom is that she will run, and that her decision to become an independent was a way for her to avoid having to run in a Democratic primary contest that she would almost definitely lose. Public and private polling by different pollsters and campaigns over the last year and a half all show that she is very unpopular among Democrats in the state, and generally unpopular across the board with white voters and voters of color, voters who are college-educated and not, and men and women. In interviews during the media rollout of her announcement, she\u2019s been cagey about saying whether she will run again. On social media, her personal Twitter account has promoted messages from Arizona local radio interviews in which voters say they would support Sinema in another race. And on YouTube, her political account shared a campaign-style video explaining why she was leaving the Democrats on the day she broke the news. It included a line about how she expected Arizona voters to feel about her decision: \u201cArizonans across the state are going to say \u2018Yeah, that\u2019s the Kyrsten we elected. That\u2019s who we sent to DC\u2019,\u201d she promised. But she came just short of saying that she hoped to be elected again, or of directing voters to donate money on her campaign website. Arizona-based organizers, pollsters, and strategists I spoke to told me that at the moment, it seems like Sinema is testing the waters in her state, seeing what kind of appetite there is for an independent candidate, and waiting to see if state Democrats coalesce around one candidate. \u201cShe has always been very strategic. She is two steps ahead of everyone else, of where she\u2019s going,\u201d Mike Noble, a longtime Arizona political strategist and the chief of research at polling firm OH Predictive Insights, told me. Her announcement echoed the decision her predecessor, former Republican Sen. Jeff Flake, had to make in 2017 after breaking with Donald Trump, he said. Sinema becoming an independent seems to dare national Democrats to sit out the statewide contest for fear of ceding the race to a Republican. In theory, that could mean her move is a way to get Democrats to support her in 2024. If Democrats choose not to support Sinema, and quickly unite behind one candidate, it could be difficult for her to find the support she\u2019d need to win. And in that case, there\u2019s a chance that Sinema sees Democrats putting up a fight and ultimately decides not to run. \u201cI am not convinced that she will actually run,\u201d Alejandra Gomez, the executive director of Living United for Change in Arizona, a progressive Latino organizing group that worked to help Sinema get elected in 2018 (but opposes her now), told me. \u201cShe\u2019s trying to figure out where her allies stand, who her people are, and party loyalty. I think she underestimates Democrats standing behind Democrats.\u201d Bill Clark / CQ Roll Call Kyrsten Sinema campaigns at a local union hall in Tucson, Arizona, during the 2018 senate race. Gomez told me that she thinks Sinema is counting on disunity among Democrats and Republicans during the primary process to open up a lane for both disaffected Democrats and Republicans to back an independent. \u201cShe\u2019s faced with a tall order now that she\u2019s put herself in this corner.\u201d It\u2019s still an open question of who Sinema\u2019s base would be, and what infrastructure would support her 2024 run if Democrats do run their own candidate: Already, her TV ad maker and a top polling firm have stopped working with her, the Huffington Post\u2019s Kevin Robillard reported. The tech firm that manages the state party\u2019s voter database is cutting her access, and another top progressive consulting firm dropped her as a client this month. A general election campaign without access to the Democratic Party\u2019s money, voter contact, and outreach apparatus, as well as its energized base during a presidential year, is a serious obstacle. (Sinema currently has about $8 million in cash on hand.) Arizona\u2019s voter pool is split into nearly even thirds between both parties and independents, and Republicans still hold a plurality of registered voters. But those voters with no party preference make up the second-largest group of voters, making them pivotal in statewide elections. In theory, those independent voters would form Sinema\u2019s base, but they have tended to split pretty evenly between both parties in statewide races. There are a number of viable alternatives Sinema could pursue if she doesn\u2019t run, ranging from an appointed position to transitioning into private sector consulting work. She\u2019s already a lecturer at Arizona State University. Whether she pursues any of these hinges on the question of why she even wants to be senator. Who would run against Sinema in a general election? Next year\u2019s primary elections in Arizona might determine whether the state sees a three-way race. It\u2019s a little early for any candidate to officially announce right now \u2014 donor networks, polling, and staff hiring must be activated first \u2014 but there are plenty of potential candidates. Among Democrats, the most obvious challenger to Sinema\u2019s nomination is Rep. Ruben Gallego, the longtime Congress member from Arizona\u2019s recently redrawn Third District. He represents the most Democratic district in the state, which stretches across Phoenix and into parts of Glendale, and has been a vocal critic of Sinema for the last few years. A former Marine, he\u2019s a progressive but considers himself less ideological and more practical in his work in Congress, and often criticizes his party for not defending its economic proposals to working-class people harder. Rep. Greg Stanton, a more moderate Arizona Democrat, has also been floated as a possible contender by state political strategists as well as national and local media (he fueled that speculation with a tweet showing what appeared to be internal polling showing how he\u2019d perform against Sinema in a primary). A former Phoenix mayor and city council member, he has served in Congress for slightly less time than Gallego, running for Sinema\u2019s old House district in 2018 when she ran for Senate, in the new Fourth District. He\u2019s a member of the New Democrat Coalition and has a more centrist identity, but like almost every other Arizona Democrat, he has voted in line with the president\u2019s agenda every time. Other possible competitors in a Democratic primary include Phoenix\u2019s current mayor, Kate Gallego, and Tucson Mayor Regina Romero, though they haven\u2019t spoken about the race. Republicans are much more divided. Coming out of a bruising election year that saw Republican candidates lose nearly all top statewide offices, the party faces a civil war between its current Trump-aligned leadership and the more traditional types that have long succeeded in statewide races. Though the state\u2019s marquee races have been certified and decided, the 2022 campaign is still not over \u2014 Kari Lake, the election-denying Republican loser in the gubernatorial race, launched a legal challenge to the results of the election. But she and outgoing Gov. Doug Ducey are probably the two Republicans with widest name recognition in the state. Ducey comes from a more conventional, pro-business conservative tradition that has a history of victory in the state. He served two terms as governor that he won by large margins, including during the 2018 blue wave that also saw Sinema elected. But his sheen has dulled in the aftermath of the 2020 election, when he stood up to Trump\u2019s demands to overturn the results of the presidential election (and faced an onslaught of Trump criticism), endorsed Lake\u2019s main opponent in the 2022 gubernatorial primary, and was used by Lake as a foil for her candidacy (she called him \u201cDo-Nothing Ducey\u201d). Plenty of congressional Republicans want him to run, but just last week he told local reporters that he\u2019s not considering a Senate run. The primary opponent Ducey and other establishment Republicans supported against Lake is also a potential contender: Karrin Taylor Robson, the lawyer and housing developer who lent herself $18 million to run a largely self-funded race, has been especially vocal about the need for Arizona\u2019s Republican Party to change directions before losing another general election. She\u2019s criticized the state party, called for the state chair, election conspiracist Kelli Ward, to step down from leadership, and has branded Lake a fake Republican and a grifter. \u201cOur party, in particular in Arizona, was hijacked by fake Republicans,\u201d Robson told me. \u201cI\u2019ve said now, many times: Kelli Ward, and the Arizona GOP, has been an unmitigated disaster. And we have to get back to a place where we know how to win and we do it based on conservative principles.\u201d Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Former Arizona gubernatorial candidate Karrin Taylor Robson greets supporters during a campaign rally in August 2022, ahead of the Republican primary. Robson told me she is not ruling out running for statewide office again: \u201cI was taught to leave my options open and give myself as many options as possible. But it\u2019s too early to say.\u201d Whether Ducey or Robson can win a Republican primary will depend on how Arizona Republican voters decide to answer the central, existential question that faces them: to continue backing Trump, Lake, election denialism, and more divisive, right-wing politics, or return to the kind of mainstream conservatism represented by John McCain and the pre-Trump Republican Party. There are plenty of names that could occupy the former space: Lake, Ward, Rep. Andy Biggs, Pinal County Sheriff Mark Lamb, and failed 2022 Senate candidate Blake Masters. There aren\u2019t many who could champion the latter. Who benefits from a three-way race? Now consider this: If Sinema did run as an independent, against both Republican and Democratic nominees, would she pull votes away from the Republican, the Democrat, or both? Plenty of reporting and punditry has assumed that a three-way race would hand the Senate seat to the GOP \u2014 that Democrats might nominate someone too far to the left to win a general election, which would push independents and moderate Democrats to vote for Sinema or the Republican. But that ignores the very real problems Arizona Republicans are having right now: their inability to move away from Trump and his brand of politics. Robson told me she hopes state leadership recognizes that most Arizona voters don\u2019t want to keep this antagonistic, bombastic, and combative style of politics going for another cycle. \u201cAs I traveled around the state in my campaign, most people out there just want to live their lives,\u201d she told me. \u201cThey\u2019re tired of the fighting, and unfortunately, today\u2019s Arizona Republican Party, led by Kelli Ward and magnified by Kari Lake, is all about dividing and tearing people apart, as opposed to bringing people together.\u201d For now, it doesn\u2019t seem like establishment Republicans have the upper hand. But should they manage to coalesce around a figure like Robson, Ducey, or state treasurer Kimberly Yee (who just won reelection by 11 points with a more moderate tone), they would pose a serious threat to both Sinema and a Democratic nominee, Noble, the Arizona pollster, told me. \u201cSinema is banking on Arizona voters to reward her in a hyper-partisan climate, and on filling that void of a Democrat version of John McCain,\u201d he said. \u201cSomeone that is a center-right Republican versus the current MAGA Republican, that would be your biggest threat, because it makes the numbers much bigger of a challenge and much less feasible for her.\u201d Her best case is having Democrats choose a progressive like Gallego, and having Republicans pick a far-right candidate, giving her an opening for moderates from both parties to join independents in voting for her. No candidate needs a majority, so she could theoretically win a plurality. For that to work, voters would need to disapprove of those candidates by a bigger margin than they currently dislike her (which, even among independents, is a high bar). Recent polling commissioned by Gallego shows that not to be the case \u2014 even with Sinema running, a theoretical Lake vs. Gallego vs. Sinema matchup is still a toss-up. All this happening during a presidential year means an even more difficult time trying to buy ad time, novel strategies to turn out voters who are thinking in binary ways, and running a campaign without institutional support. Of course, the only way we\u2019ll actually know any of this for sure is to see the campaign play out. Buckle up.",

    "content": "Pope Benedict XVI waves as he is driven through a crowd during his weekly general audience, in St. Peter's Square at the Vatican, on June 2, 2010. AP Photo/Andrew MedichiniBenedict XVI leaves behind a complex legacy as a Pope and theologian. To many observers, Benedict was known for criticizing what he saw as the modern world\u2019s rejection of God and Christianity\u2019s timeless truths. But as a scholar of the diversity of global Catholicism, I think it\u2019s best to avoid simple characterizations of Benedict\u2019s theology, which I believe will influence the Catholic Church for generations. While the brilliance of this intellectual legacy will certainly endure, it will also have to contend with the shadows of the numerous controversies that marked Benedict\u2019s time as pope and, later, as pope emeritus. Priest and professor Benedict was born Josef Alois Ratzinger on April 16, 1927, in Marktl am Inn, Germany. During World War II, he was required to join the Hitler Youth, a wing of the Nazi Party. He was later drafted into an anti-aircraft unit and then the infantry of Nazi Germany. Josef Ratzinger taking office as Bishop of Munich in 1977. Claus Hampel/ullstein bild via Getty Images In 1945, he deserted the German military and was held as a prisoner of war by the Americans; he was released when World War II concluded. In 1946, he went to study for the priesthood and was ordained five years later. He completed his doctorate in theology in 1953. While teaching at the University of Bonn, Ratzinger was chosen as a theological adviser to Cardinal Joseph Frings of Cologne, a strong critic of Nazism, for the Second Vatican Council held between 1962 and 1965. The Second Vatican Council attempted to renew the Catholic Church by engaging the modern world more constructively. At the council, Ratzinger argued that Catholic theology needed to develop a \u201cnew language\u201d to speak to a changing world. As pope, Benedict would later reject more progressive interpretations of the council as a revolutionary event that was intended to remake the Catholic Church. While the council did bring substantial changes to Catholic life, particularly by allowing mass in local languages, Benedict resisted any suggestion that the Second Vatican Council was calling for a fundamental break with centuries-old Catholic doctrine and tradition. And during his pontificate, he would permit wider celebration of the old Latin Mass \u2013 a decision that his successor Pope Francis would later reverse In 1966, Ratzinger accepted an important teaching position at the University of Tubingen. During the late 1960s, Tubingen saw widespread student protests, some of which called for the Catholic Church to become more democratic. When protesting students disrupted the Tubingen faculty senate, Ratzinger reportedly walked out instead of speaking with students as other faculty did. Ratzinger was disturbed by what he felt were dictatorial and Marxist tendencies among the student protesters. Ratzinger then moved to the University of Regensberg. In 1977, he was named bishop of Munich and Freising by Pope Paul VI. Soon after, he was named a cardinal, a member of the administrative body that elects the pope. Cardinal and pope As a skilled theologian, Ratzinger was chosen by Pope John Paul II to head the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, which oversees and enforces Catholic doctrine. In this position, Cardinal Ratzinger disciplined a number of theologians. Most notable was the case of American priest and theologian Charles Curran, who was fired from The Catholic University of America because he challenged official Catholic teachings on sexuality. Ratzinger was also chosen to head the committee drafting The Catechism of the Catholic Church. Published in 1992, The Catechism remains an important foundation for any understanding of Catholic thought and practice. After John Paul II\u2019s death in 2005, Ratzinger was elected pope. He chose the name \u201cBenedict\u201d in honor of Benedict of Nursia, the founder of Western monasticism, a religious movement that preserved Western culture after the fall of Rome. The name \u201cBenedict\u201d also acknowledged Benedict XV, a much-overlooked pope who tried to broker a peace agreement to end the First World War. Controversies in the pontificate After his election, Pope Benedict XVI had to confront a growing sexual abuse scandal in the Catholic Church. While a cardinal, he had publicly downplayed the extent and seriousness of the crisis. And it was under his leadership that The Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith decided not to remove Lawrence C. Murphy from the priesthood, even though Murphy had been accused of molesting more than 200 boys at a Catholic school for the deaf in Wisconsin. As pope, however, Benedict did take some strong steps that his predecessor, John Paul II, did not. Most significantly, Benedict punished Marcial Maciel Degollado, an incestuous bigamist, serial pedophile and the powerful founder of the Legionaries of Christ, an important Catholic religious order, by taking away his permission to preach or to say Mass publicly. He also criticized Irish bishops for their mishandling of the sexual abuse crisis. For many survivors of clerical sexual abuse, these actions were not nearly enough. Benedict did not move to open Vatican records to public investigation, and he also failed to discipline cardinals and bishops who reassigned pedophile priests. Beyond the sexual abuse crisis, Benedict\u2019s pontificate had other controversies that drew worldwide attention. During a lecture in Regensberg in 2006, Benedict seemed to criticize the Islamic view of God and the legacy of the Prophet Muhammad. This lecture led to protests in the Middle East and South Asia. However, his official visits to Beirut and Istanbul repaired some of the damage. Benedict also reached out to Catholic splinter groups. In 2009, he lifted the excommunication of bishops of the order of St. Pius X, a breakaway Catholic sect that rejects the reforms of the Second Vatican Council. After doing this, Benedict learned that one St. Pius X bishop, Richard Williamson, had made antisemitic comments and denied the holocaust. Benedict said his lack of knowledge about Williamson\u2019s views was an \u201cunforeseen mishap\u201d due to a lack of familiarity with the internet as a \u201csource of information.\u201d Theological writings As pope, Benedict continued his theological writing and produced three important encyclicals or papal letters. The first encyclical, Deus Caritas Est, or \u201cGod is Love,\u201d defends \u201ccharity\u201d as love that is freely given. Charity is not simply a good deed but an act that changes both the giver and the recipient. The second encyclical, Spe Salvi, or \u201cSaved in Hope,\u201d reflects upon the hope that God gives human beings in a world that often seems hopeless. In the third encyclical, Caritas in Veritate, or \u201cCharity in Truth,\u201d Benedict argues that charity is fundamentally related to justice. And when it comes to questions of human progress and fulfillment, we cannot place our trust in the nation state or market economies because \u201cwithout God, man neither knows which way to go, nor even understands who he is.\u201d These papal letters attempt to defend Christianity in a world that Benedict believed was growing increasingly hostile to religious faith. What was striking about Benedict\u2019s thought \u2013 even to his theological critics \u2013 was how elegantly he presented his case for Christ and Christianity\u2019s transforming power as sources of truth, beauty and love. But long before he became pope, Benedict admitted that Christianity would continue to lose cultural ground and dwindle to an ever smaller group of faithful believers. Writing in 1969, Ratzinger predicted the Church would have \u201cto start afresh from the very beginning,\u201d which meant that someday Christianity would have to build itself up again from its foundations. The legacy of Benedict XVI Pope Benedict XVI during a general audience held at the Vatican in 2013. AP Photo/Andrew Medichini When Benedict resigned as pope in 2013, it took the world by surprise. In saying that he could no longer bear the burdens of the Papacy, Benedict promised to live in seclusion. His official title became \u201cPope Emeritus.\u201d But controversy also followed his resignation. For example, he gave interviews and put his name on writings that appeared to criticize the reforms of Pope Francis, who succeeded him. Most recently, a January 2022 report on sexual abuse in the diocese of Munich criticized Ratzinger\u2019s \u201cinaction\u201d regarding four cases of sexual abuse during his period as archbishop from 1977 to 1982. In reaction to the report, the pope emeritus apologized but did not admit to any administrative failures. Benedict XVI\u2019s writings will be relevant decades from now, but his pontificate will inevitably be associated with controversies. As for his own personal legacy, that will likely be defined by the one issue that concerned Benedict the most: how the Catholic Church can still make a difference in the modern world.

    "content": "The NBA is the fifth-most richest league in the world in terms of broadcast evaluations. The economic impact the NBA holds, therefore, is considerable. Any evaluation and related economic prowess automatically come down to the popularity and marketability of the league. And it seems there is no shortage of such marketable superstars in the NBA, at least as of now. Sitting firmly atop that list is 38-year-old LeBron James. Also read: LeBron James, Whose Jersey Could Sell For $5 Million, Has His Jordans From High School Priced Around $200,000 The \u201cBoy from Akron\u201d has been a feature of the league for two decades and has shown little to no signs of slowing down. A 47-piece on his 38th birthday is merely the latest feather to his well-laden cap. James\u2019 greatness and what he has done for the NBA and his community, in general, have been well documented. The same is a fact not lost to others, including his teammates. James\u2019 teammate Patrick Beverley, is one of those who acknowledge the importance of James\u2019 contributions, even to the economy of the communities he is associated with. What did Patrick Beverley have to say about LeBron James\u2019 influence on the economy? Patrick Beverley only recently became a teammate of LeBron\u2019s as a trade took him to LA earlier this season. The man widely known as a \u201cpest\u201d, however, seems to be in awe of his superstar teammate. Beverley, in a podcast interview, spoke about how his relationship with James goes beyond LA and about how the superstar has been taken for granted by people. \u201cWhen you\u2019re talking about black catalysts, people in history books, he would go down as a superhero. We\u2019ve been knowing each other for a very, very long time. It\u2019s not like he makes you feel small or anything. He\u2019s always giving advice, open, funny. To be around all that every day. I think sometimes people take that stuff for granted. You changed the economy in Cleveland. It\u2019s really crazy. More people had jobs\u201d described Beverley of James\u2019 impact and legacy. A report from 2014 substantiates Beverley\u2019s claims and gives a quantitative outlook into LeBron\u2019s impact too. The King\u2019s fiscal impact on Cleveland and surrounding areas came out to around $50 million a year. Incredible numbers indeed, to highlight an individual\u2019s impact on his hometown\u2019s economy. This was prior to James getting Cleveland its first NBA championship. The numbers would have most definitively surged subsequently. The league\u2019s most marketable athlete has definitely proved to be worth his hype, both on and off the field. How much is \u2018superhero\u2019 LeBron James worth himself? It isn\u2019t merely Cleveland that has seen economic growth from the stardom of LeBron James. The star has made himself a billionaire with smart investments and betting on his own burgeoning stardom. In June 2022, James officially attained billionaire status. Currently valued at $1.2 billion, the Laker superstar is only expected to expand his portfolio going forward. The \u201cBoy from Akron\u201d is the NBA\u2019s only active billionaire and has a blockbuster lifetime deal with Nike. Movie productions, podcasts, football clubs \u2013 name it, LeBron has done it all. With further clever financial maneuvering, will James take over Michael Jordan as the richest NBA player of all time?

Previously, McCall\u00a0canceled a scheduled visit to Auburn the weekend before Christmas.On Tuesday, playing in what at the time was thought to be his last game in a Coastal Carolina uniform, McCall completed 10 of 12 passes for 67 yards. He left the Chanticleers\u2019 53\u201329 loss to\u00a0East Carolina\u00a0in the Birmingham Bowl with an upper-body injury.The Indian Trail, N.C. native was repeatedly banged up in 2022 as Coastal Carolina regressed slightly to a 9\u20134 ledger. A high ankle sprain cost McCall November games against\u00a0Southern Miss\u00a0and\u00a0James Madison, the latter of which the Chanticleers lost 47\u20137.McCall is most closely associated by the wider college football world with Coastal Carolina\u2019s 11\u20131 season in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. That year, he threw for 26 touchdowns against three interceptions as the Chanticleers rose as high as No. 9 in the AP Poll in their third FBS season.",

    "content": "Wireless Power Consortium (WPC) \u2014 an organization that overlooks wireless charging standards \u2014 announced a new standard called Qi2. The headline is that the WPC is working with Apple to bring Magsafe-like capabilities to Android. It\u2019s been over two years since Apple introduced MagSafe for iPhones \u2014 a wireless standard that opens up a ton of magnetically attachable accessories including chargers. The company\u2019s primary purpose was to bump up the speed of wireless charging \u2014 from 7.5W for Qi-compatible chargers to 15W for MagSafe Chargers. Apple also wanted to get rid of the difficulty of having to perfectly align the phone with the wireless charging pad with magnets that snap to the back of the phone perfectly. However, the standard is still proprietary and the Apple-certified ecosystem of accessories hasn\u2019t grown much. The WPC said that Qi2 enables a Magnetic Power Profile \u2014 built on the basis of Apple\u2019s MagSafe technology. So it\u2019s likely that devices compatible with the Qi2 standard will work will both Android and iOS-based devices. \u201cQi2\u2019s Magnetic Power Profile will ensure that phones or other rechargeable battery-powered mobile products are perfectly aligned with charging devices, thus providing improved energy efficiency and faster charging,\u201d the WPC said in a press release. The consortium said that the new Qi2 standard will be released later this year and will replace the existing Qi standard. And Qi2 compatible accessories should be available before the end of the year. Notably, it said this new standard will pave way for accessories \u201cthat wouldn\u2019t be chargeable using current flat surface-to-flat surface devices.\u201d This could be used for charging different kinds of headphones or smartwatches. The WPC hasn\u2019t released full specifications related to Qi2, so we don\u2019t know about its capabilities just yet. A WPC spokesperson told The Verge that while initially Qi2 will cap charging speeds at 15W, it plans to work on higher power profiles for the standard at a later stage. The Qi2 standard might set the stage for a faster magnet-enabled wireless charging experience, but it won\u2019t ensure the quality of magnets used in the chargers or phones. So it is hard to guarantee a secure magnetic fit with Qi2-compatible chargers. It\u2019s also not clear if chargers with this new standard will work perfectly with iPhone 14 or older models. Apple didn\u2019t comment on the story at the time of writing. As Apple will adopt USB-C for iPhones due to regulations in the EU and India, it might look for another standard to control. Right now, wireless charging \u2014 especially something like MagSafe \u2014 is nowhere near wired charging speeds. By having MagSafe be the base for a Qi2-like standard that will be widely adopted, Apple might be setting the ground for having iPhones rely more (or even completely) on wireless charging in the future. Wireless Power Consortium is working with Apple to bring MagSafe-like capabilities to Android by Ivan Mehta originally published on TechCrunch",

    "content": "Bird Buddy, the maker of a smart bird feeder that snaps photos of your bird visitors which are collected in a companion mobile app, is out today with another product for its nature enthusiast and birdwatching community. At the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, the company is showing off a prototype of its new A.I.-powered Smart Hummingbird Feeder, which is able to take photos and videos of 350 different hummingbird species with wing speeds of up to 60 mph. Like its original smart bird feeder, the new feeder\u2019s camera is triggered by motion which prompts it to take photos of the bird. Those are then run through an A.I. program to help identify the species, alerting the user to their visitor through the Bird Buddy mobile app. Originally a crowdfunded startup through Kickstarter, Bird Buddy realized it couldn\u2019t rely on open databases to help it properly identify bird photos. So in 2021, it built around 250 test cameras and sent them out to volunteer Kickstarter backers to help it develop its own A.I. tech. The company collected around 3 million photos, then hired an ornithologist and team of interns to manually process over 2 million photos to train its bird identification A.I. That has allowed Bird Buddy\u2019s system to identify around 1,000 birds \u2014 now including hummingbirds. Bird Buddy also comes with a nicely designed mobile app that gamifies the birdwatching experience. In the app, users build out their collection of birds, track birds\u2019 visits over time, learn about their habits, and share bird photos with the community, giving a bit of modern-day flair to what\u2019s often thought of as an older person\u2019s hobby. Image Credits: Bird Buddy The company says there are now 100,000 users in the Bird Buddy community who have a smart feeder. A new Heartbeat Map website, also launching at CES, lets others outside of Bird Buddy\u2019s own customer base track the bird sightings in real-time. At CES, the company demonstrated its new Hummingbird Feeder, noting it plans to build the feeder with recyclable and sustainable materials while also offering new features to cater to hummingbirds, like ports with a lily-shaped red flower that provides access to the nectar the birds will eat. The two-part design snaps together with a seal to prevent mold and leaks, but can easily be unsnapped to clean. And like the original Bird Buddy smart feeder, the new feeder features a swappable camera module, optional solar roof, motion sensors, and A.I. tech. The company\u2019s original feeder is $199 or $269 with a solar roof and has only been shipping since September. The Hummingbird Feeder isn\u2019t yet priced but will be comparable or maybe a little less, we\u2019re told. The company hopes to launch the new feeder later this year. Image Credits: Bird Buddy Longer-term, Bird Buddy\u2019s ultimate success may not be from its feeders themselves but from the data it collects. \u201cWe get timestamps, and we know the species and we know \u2014 generally \u2014 the location based on the town that you put in,\u201d explains Bird Buddy co-founder Kyle Buzzard, in a chat at CES. \u201cWe\u2019re building the largest database of bird visits.\u201d He says the company wants to open-source this data to allow organizations like the Audubon Society and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, as well as universities, to have access. The team has also discussed allowing users to photograph and ID birds using just their phones. In addition to Kickstarter funds the Slovenia- and Kalamazoo, Michigan-based startup raised $8.5 million from General Catalyst and Backed in a seed round last year.

    "description": "The halls of CES are full of smart home products, but some of them grab our attention more than others. Enter Bird Buddy, a company that makes camera-equipped bird feeders for keeping tabs on the winged friends around your yard, patio or balcony. The current model accommodates whatever seed you prefer and motion sensor alerts you via the company's app when you have a visitor. That same software catalogs images and video clips as well. It's like a security cam, but way more fun.\u00a0At CES 2023, Bird Buddy is adding an AI-powered smart feeder for hummingbirds to its lineup. The aptly named Smart Hummingbird Feeder can identify 350 species of the animals and the motion sensor lets you know when one is ready for a snack. This model can be disassembled in two parts, which Bird Buddy says helps with regular cleanings, and the company explains that the design will prevent leaks. Just like the original, the camera is removable when it needs a charge and there's an optional solar roof should you choose to splurge.\u00a0The Bird Buddy Smart Hummingbird Feeder is expected to go on sale in late 2023.",

    "description": "According to a Mt Gox announcement, base, and intermediate payments will be moved back from July to September 2023. After many years of waiting for their funds, creditors can now see a light at the end of the tunnel, albeit a slightly extended one. Creditors that were expecting to receive their first repayments in July, will now have to wait until September. Creditors will first receive a base payment, and then also a lump sum payment. Another available option is to wait a further period, and then accept what could potentially be a larger sum. Payments are to be made in cryptocurrency, a bank deposit, or a combination of both. According to a report by The Block, speculation has it that the recent change of date for crypto payments may be related to Kraken's decision to exit the Japanese market. Creditors had the option to choose from several exchanges to receive their payments, with Kraken being one of them.\u00a0 However, the exchange announced that it will be leaving Japan in January, causing some creditors to face difficulties in getting their exchange details verified in time for the previous deadline.\u00a0 Many creditors have registered with multiple exchanges as a backup, but some are still waiting for their KYC to be completed.\u00a0 While Kraken's exit may not impact the majority of creditors, it could create issues for Japanese users looking to exchange their crypto for fiat currency and withdraw to their local bank accounts. The Mt Gox bankruptcy, following a hack, goes all the way back to 2014. The current day FTX debacle might be argued to pale in comparison, given that 740,000 bitcoins were stolen from customers, along with 100,000 bitcoins belonging to Mt Gox itself.

    "description": "The Biden administration is proposing amendments to the Revised Pay As You Earn (PEPAYE) program made available in 2016.",
    "content": "The Biden administration and the U.S. Department of Education are proposing amended regulations to the Revised Pay As You Earn (REPAYE) initiative which was made available to student borrowers in 2016.The administration said in a statement made public on Tuesday that \"higher education should be a ticket to the middle class, not saddle individuals with student debt that becomes a lifelong financial burden.\"The administration wants to try and find ways to offer some relief to student loan borrowers to promote the ability to become homeowners, start businesses and save for retirement. The Department of Education (DOE) says that under a revised and updated REPAYE plan, it hopes future borrowers would \"see lifetime payments per dollar borrowed fall by 40 percent.\"DOE says \"on average,\" Hispanic, Black, American Indian and Alaska Natives could expect to see their lifetime payments \"per dollar\" reduced by 50%.For borrowers in the bottom 30% of earners, DOE says it hopes the updates to the REPAYE plan would have those borrowers see lifetime payments per dollar borrowed reduced by 83% on average.And DOE says that under the updated plan student borrowers with an income below $30,500 annually would not be responsible for making monthly payments on their loans. The Biden administration released an announcement saying that it will hold colleges and universities more accountable for creating more value for students and making education more affordable. The administration proposed several goals under this topic, including requiring educational institutions to warn students, before receiving federal aid, if they are attending a \"low-financial-value\" program. The Biden administration's announcement said that it recognizes that some educational programs leave students with too much debt compared to their expected earnings in the job market. Institutions, under the new rules, would be required to submit to additional conditions if the educational institution is \"exhibiting signs of distress or concerning behavior.\"The updated PAYE conditions would also stop colleges and universities from forcing students to sign forced arbitration agreements and class action waivers that \"insulate bad actors from accountability\" in the U.S. justice system.",

    "content": "More than $17 million in restitution will be distributed among investors in the pyramid scheme Bitconnect under a court order in the United States. The notorious crypto investment scheme defrauded thousands of people around the world. Bitconnect Investors From Dozens of Countries to Be Paid Back Millions of US Dollars A total of over $17 million in restitution will be returned to around 800 victims from more than 40 countries who lost money to Bitconnect, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) announced Thursday, quoting an order issued by a federal district court in San Diego. The large-scale crypto investment scheme defrauded thousands of investors globally. The ruling comes after on Sept. 16, 2021, the top U.S.-based promoter of Bitconnect, 44-year-old Glenn Arcaro, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud. He admitted to marketing Bitconnect\u2019s initial coin offering and digital currency exchange as a lucrative investment with the goal to exploit investor interest in cryptocurrency. Arcaro and his co-conspirators misled investors about Bitconnect\u2019s \u201cLending Program\u201d and its purported proprietary \u201cBitconnect Trading Bot\u201d and \u201cVolatility Software\u201d technologies which, as they claimed, could generate guaranteed returns on investors\u2019 money used to trade on crypto exchange markets. \u201cIn truth, however, Bitconnect operated a textbook Ponzi scheme by paying earlier Bitconnect investors with money from later investors. Arcaro and his co-conspirators ensured that up to 15% of the money invested into Bitconnect went directly into a slush fund to be used for the benefit of its owner and promoters,\u201d the DOJ explained. Glenn Arcaro, a resident of Los Angeles, was sentenced to 38 months in U.S. federal prison in September of 2022. He admitted to earning at least $24 million from the scam. At the time, the DOJ pointed out that all of that money will be repaid to investors or forfeited to the government. In November, the previous year, the Justice department had offered for sale $56 million worth of crypto assets seized from Bitconnect. The crypto pyramid\u2019s founder, Indian national Satish Kumbhani, was indicted on Feb. 25, 2022 for his key role in organizing the $3.4 billion fraud scheme. In August, police in India launched an investigation into Bitconnect and a search for its mastermind. If convicted in the U.S., he would face a maximum of 70 years in prison. Do you think Bitconnect investors will receive further compensation for their losses to the Ponzi scheme? Tell us in the comments section below.",

Until recently, they had the best home record in the league, and the worst road record. The team looked totally different at Chase Center and the polar opposite on the road. As they started on the five-game trip, the Warriors would be hoping to not only secure wins, but also improve their road record in the process. Tonight, they recorded a 144-113 win over the Spurs at the Alamodome. This is their fourth road win of the season, and by far, the most impressive one. Talking about the same, Stephen Curry joked and said, \u201cIt takes 64,000 to bring our best road performance of the year.\u201d Steph describes what it was like to play in front of a record-setting crowd pic.twitter.com/7RIS2laNJH \u2014 Warriors on NBCS (@NBCSWarriors) January 14, 2023 Well, Steph was a little off on the number there.

After tonight\u2019s game, the Warriors sit on the 7th seed in the West with a 21-21 record. They are 7.5 games behind the top seed in the West, and two games behind the 5th-seeded Kings. With Stephen Curry and Andrew Wiggins back and healthy, the Dubs can make a push for better seeding. They seem to have figured out a few of their issues, but a lot more are still bothering the team. The Warriors would have to elevate their performance to the next level to record a good seeding before the playoffs. It\u2019s a highly competitive Western Conference, with the 13th-seeded Lakers just two games behind the Warriors. Steve Kerr and co would have a note of the same and would look to eliminate their careless mistakes.

Its stated aim, as WIRED put it in a 2017 feature, was to become the new US National Football League. The two institutions certainly overlapped: The Overwatch League was the first major esports league to franchise local teams in major cities, and it features live spectator events with hometown crowds and salaried athletes. The goal was to offer esports fans a more traditional sports model, where they could go to a local arena or venue, see their hometown team play against an \u201caway\u201d team, and cheer during the event. The model offered local pop-up stores, team merchandise, ticket sales, media rights, and licensing. Read 18 remaining paragraphs | Comments",

Aviation is full of acronyms, and Notice to Air Missions, or NOTAM, is one acronym that pilots learn early on in their training. A NOTAM is quite simply a message that is disseminated to flight crews of every aircraft in the US.Read 11 remaining paragraphs | Comments",

The key to the approach is in the title \u2013 there\u2019s a timeworn predictability in everything from the plot (variations of this story have been told many times before, most recently in the superior Old Henry) to the big, expansive, Alfred Newman-inspired score, to the widescreen wild west backdrop.Two elements make the picture worth watching: one is Nicolas Cage, wearily brutal as Colton Briggs, a man who has already completed a lifetime\u2019s worth of killing. The other is Ryan Kiera Armstrong, playing his 12-year-old daughter Brooke, a chip off the old block. Both Colton and Brooke struggle to manifest the \u201cnormal\u2019 emotional responses. Their revenge is coolly efficient; their relationship \u2013 the only unconventional element in the picture \u2013 is angular, uncomfortable and unexpectedly affecting.In cinemas and on digital platforms Continue reading...",

    "content": "Enlarge / Amazon's Kindle Scribe e-reader. Andrew Cunningham reader comments 5 with 0 posters participating Share this story Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Reddit Amazon's Kindle e-readers have been around for 15 years, and they've remained steadfastly focused on displaying books for reading (and, to a lesser extent, audiobooks). Input has never been something they've been particularly concerned with. The devices' poky processors and laggy touchscreen keyboards are best suited for short annotations or looking up the name of a book or author\u2014not for writing anything longer than a sentence or two, and certainly not for taking notes or jotting down idle thoughts. That's the main change to the Kindle Scribe , the newest and most expensive member of the e-reader family. It's the first Kindle with its own purpose-built pen accessory and a 10.2-inch screen that's more suitable for input than the 6-to-7-inch screens on other Kindles. It doesn't come cheap\u2014it starts at $340 and goes up quickly from there. It's over three times as expensive as the Kindle Paperwhite and not much cheaper than a baseline iPad and Apple Pencil combo. But it's also trying to do some new things that older Kindles aren't built for. The problem for the Scribe is that the Kindle's software, likewise laser-focused on the reading experience and not the input experience, doesn't feel robust enough to deliver on the pen's promise. The actual handwriting experience is great, which gives us some hope that further updates could make this device more useful. But as it is, most of the things it's trying to do are things that an iPad is better at, and they come at the cost of some of the regular Kindle's best features. Advertisement Look and feel Enlarge / The Kindle Scribe (right) next to the current-gen Paperwhite (left). Andrew Cunningham The Scribe takes its design cues from the Kindle Oasis, previously the top-tier Kindle. Its display sits flush with its asymmetrical bezel, which is thicker on one side to give people holding the device with one hand more room. As with the Oasis, the Scribe can be used either left- or right-handed, and the screen's contents will flip 180 degrees based on how you're holding it. The back of the Scribe is a large, flat slab of aluminum, and if you're holding it without a case on it, the increased size and weight definitely make it more reminiscent of an iPad than the other Kindles. The increased size also makes one-handed operation less comfortable than it is with smaller Kindles\u2014it's comfortable for short stretches because the side bezel is large enough that you can really get a good grip on it, but it becomes fatiguing after a few minutes. The back of the Scribe is a mostly flat slab of aluminum; the four small rubber feet help to align it properly when you're using its case. Andrew Cunningham The USB-C port and power button are on the same side as the thicker bezel. Andrew Cunningham The Scribe is missing two Oasis features of note. One is waterproofing, so don't drop the Scribe in the tub, pool, or ocean.

    "content": "A young girl rides on a man\u2019s shoulders as they walk along a street in Beijing on October 7, 2022. China has announced its first overall population decline in recent years amid an aging society and plunging birthrate. | Mark Schiefelbein/AP Why the world\u2019s most populous country (for now) is experiencing population decline. More than 60 years ago, something rare happened in China: More people died than were born. That estimated one-year drop in population was due to the Great Famine, perhaps the worst human-made catastrophe in history, resulting in the deaths of as many as 45 million people. Combined with a short but drastic drop in the birthrate, China shrank by roughly 700,000 people between 1960 and 1961. Once Chinese leader Mao abandoned the forced industrialization policies that led to the Great Famine, however, China\u2019s fertility rate quickly rebounded and deaths fell, and today more than twice as many Chinese are alive as were in 1961. But now, for the first time since that year, China\u2019s population is again shrinking. And this time, it\u2019s not likely to rebound \u2014 not soon, and perhaps not ever. On Tuesday, the Chinese government reported that 9.56 million people were born in China last year, while 10.41 million people had died. You don\u2019t have to be a demographer to know what that means \u2014 all you need to do is subtract. China may have already lost its position as the world\u2019s most populous country to a still-surging India. While Covid played some role in those numbers \u2014 though how much is hard to say, given Beijing\u2019s lack of transparency around the full toll of the pandemic \u2014 this isn\u2019t like the early 1960s. China\u2019s population drop isn\u2019t the result of a single, acute crisis, but years of policy decisions and cultural and economic shifts that have led this nation of 1.4 billion people to where it is today: facing an aging and shrinking population for the foreseeable future. This doesn\u2019t mean that China as a country or as a world power is locked into irreversible decline. What\u2019s happening in China is happening at varying speeds in most countries, as the world \u2014 with the exception of still-young regions like sub-Saharan Africa \u2014 completes the transition from high fertility to low, with two-thirds of the planet living in nations that do not have enough children to replace their population through reproduction alone. Many of these demographic forces are positive, the result of economic growth that has given people, especially women, the freedom to live the life they want, including one with fewer or even no children. But it does mean \u2014 as Wang Feng, a sociologist at the University of California Irvine who specializes in Chinese demographics, told the New York Times \u2014 \u201cin the long run, we are going to see a China the world has never seen.\u201d As much as China\u2019s aging and eventual shrinking was a demographic inevitability as it became richer and more modern, the particular speed at which that transition is occurring, and the particular challenges that pace will present, are Beijing\u2019s own doing. Demographic regrets In 2015, the Chinese government did something it almost never does: It admitted it made a mistake, at least implicitly. The ruling Communist Party announced that it was ending its historic and coercive one-child policy, allowing all married couples to have up to two children. The one-child policy had helped lead to the mother of all demographic dividends, the term for the economist boost created when a country\u2019s birth and death rates both decline. Between 1980 and 2015, China\u2019s working-age population grew from 594 million to a little over 1 billion. China\u2019s dependency ratio \u2014 the total young and elderly population relative to the working-age population \u2014 fell from over 68 percent in 1980 to less than 38 percent in 2015, which meant more workers for every non-working person. Bettmann Archive Giant billboards erected throughout China \u2014 like this one seen in Beijing in 1983 \u2014 encouraged Chinese couples to have only one child in the modernization drive to limit China\u2019s population to 1.2 billion people by the year 2000. Having more young workers who had fewer young or old dependents to care for was the fuel in China\u2019s economic rocket engine. But no fuel burns forever, and over the past decade, hundreds of millions of Chinese have hit retirement age, with a plummeting number of young people to replace them. So the slogans went from \u201cHaving only one child is good\u201d to \u201cOne is too few, while two are just right.\u201d How did the Chinese people react? Not by having more children. By 2021, China\u2019s total fertility rate (that is, the number of expected births per woman over the course of their reproductive lifetime) had fallen to just 1.15, nearly a full child below the replacement rate of 2.1. (That\u2019s two to replace each parent, plus a slight extra to make up for children who might die before they reach adulthood \u2014 demographics is a dismal science.) For the people of China, if not the government, it seems two was not just right. Total births in China have now fallen for six straight years, and the United Nations\u2019 middle-of-the-road projections find that by the end of the century, the country\u2019s total population will have fallen below 800 million people, a level it hasn\u2019t been since the late 1960s. Unlike then, when the median Chinese was in their highly productive early 20s, that smaller China will be far older. That\u2019s not, on its face, a bad thing \u2014 population aging is a result not just of fewer babies, but of people surviving infancy and childhood at higher rates and living longer lives. (Life expectancy in China has risen from a shocking 33 years in 1960 to 78 today \u2014 higher, in fact, than the far richer US.) But with fewer young workers and more elderly dependents, it will be far more difficult to keep China\u2019s economic engine humming. Chinese economic growth in the last three months of the year fell to just 2.9 percent, its lowest record level since Mao\u2019s death in 1976. That was largely a result of the double whammy of months of Covid lockdowns followed by widespread outbreaks when those restrictions were suddenly lifted, but it also presages a broader and longer-term slowdown. Why China\u2019s aging challenge is so grave Just about every developed country, the US very much included, will need to grapple with the effects of an aging population, but China faces particular challenges. For all its power and aggregate wealth \u2014 it is by most accounts the world\u2019s second-largest economy \u2014 on a per capita basis, it\u2019s still a middle-income country at best. To reach anything like a per capita parity with a country like the UK, let alone the US, would require years more of high-powered economic growth that will be increasingly difficult to pull off in an aging nation. In the end, China could get old before it gets rich. And if China can\u2019t grow faster, the elderly will bear the brunt of the cost. A 2013 study estimated that nearly a quarter of China\u2019s seniors live below the poverty line, and the country \u2014 like many others in East Asia, including richer nations like Japan and South Korea \u2014 has little in the way of old-age support. That was less of a problem when older adults could count on being taken care of by their children, but decades of the one-child policy has left an inverted pyramid known as \u201c4-2-1,\u201d with four grandparents and two parents depending on one child. Jiang Wenyao/Xinhua via Getty Images A girl high-fives her grandfather, who came to pick her up at Kunming Changshui International Airport in southwest China\u2019s Yunnan Province on January 15, as families travel to be with their loved ones amid the Spring Festival travel rush. As more and more young Chinese choose to go without children altogether \u2014 pursuing the \u201cdouble income, no kids\u201d lifestyle \u2014 more and more elderly Chinese will have no familial support whatsoever, with one survey projecting 79 million childless older adults in China by 2050. And those trends will reinforce each other \u2014 younger Chinese are already citing the burden of caring for elderly parents as one reason to have fewer or no children. It\u2019s worth repeating that this state of affairs was, for the most part, inevitable. The fertility transition \u2014 the drastic drop in fertility as countries become richer \u2014 is as close to an iron law as demography has. There is no foreseeable situation where China could have developed as it has if its mid-1960s fertility rates of six to seven children per woman had continued, and much of that drop was due to improvements in infant mortality that gave parents confidence their children would live to adulthood. But while the ultimate destination of a demographic transition may be largely set, how fast you get there matters a lot \u2014 and years of the one-child policy, well past the point at which it made economic or demographic sense, have hurt China\u2019s ability to manage that transition. More out of less Beyond ending the one-child policy, the Chinese government has begun offering financial inducements to couples to have more children, following in the footsteps of other countries that have faced demographic deficits. Shanghai will give mothers 60 days of additional parental leave, while Shenzhen has joined other Chinese cities in giving subsidies \u2014 $1,476 in its case \u2014 to couples who have a third child. But don\u2019t expect these moves to make a major difference in birth rates. While such financial incentives might prompt couples to have a child earlier than they had planned, there\u2019s little evidence the programs can convince a childless couple to have a kid, or lastingly increase birthrates. Instead, China will need to focus on increasing worker productivity and the benefits of automation, while improving its social safety net, in order to manage its demographic transition as smoothly as possible. It won\u2019t be easy \u2014 while it\u2019s advancing rapidly in AI and its manufacturing know-how is top-notch, one of China\u2019s biggest advantages is still its large pool of young workers. That pool is drying up, though, while the country lacks the resources of already old neighbors like Japan that could help support its growing elderly population. But a worse outcome might be if China\u2019s authoritarian government tries to compel its citizens to have more children with the same heavy hand it once used to prevent them from doing just that. Already, growing discrimination against China\u2019s LGBTQ citizens is being framed as a response to the country\u2019s supposed demographic crisis. A better future would be one where Beijing does everything it can to support the demographic choices its citizens want to make \u2014 and, in doing so, provides a more solid foundation for those Chinese who actively want to have more children. That will take plenty of work. The rising costs of having a family, the Darwinian competition for educational resources and jobs, and the lingering effects of years of harsh Covid crackdowns have left China\u2019s young people in a state of existential crisis. As one young Shanghai protester told coronavirus workers in a video that went viral last year, \u201cwe are the last generation.\u201d It\u2019s up to the Chinese government to ensure that\u2019s not the case.",

    "content": "For your safety The Times is committed to reviewing theatrical film releases during the COVID-19 pandemic . Because moviegoing carries risks during this time, we remind readers to follow health and safety guidelines as outlined by the CDC and local health officials . To American audiences, especially comic fans, the title \u201cNew Gods\u201d may confuse. \u201c New Gods: Yang Jian \u201d is not related to comic legend Jack Kirby\u2019s 1970s DC masterwork that spawned Darkseid , Mister Miracle and others. And the gods are hardly new; the protagonists of this exquisitely animated Chinese film franchise (first \u201cNezha Reborn,\u201d now \u201cYang Jian,\u201d with \u201cThe Monkey King\u201d possibly next) are very, very old gods \u2014 figures from mythology reimagined for modern viewers. There\u2019s plenty of imagination in that reimagining: The world of \u201cNew Gods: Yang Jian\u201d is a swirling m\u00e9lange of myth, pseudo-steampunk, \u201cBlade Runner,\u201d the kung-fu film genre and music from many corners of your ears. Bet you didn\u2019t expect a gorgeously rendered Chinese legend to be characteristically scored by a lonesome harmonica (among the comedic swing, reggae and everything else). We\u2019re introduced via opening narration to a world that has survived an epic war among the gods in which the realms of the mortal and immortal are aware of each other but now generally keep apart. Our lethargic lead is fallen hero Erlang Shen , who used to be a big deal but now leads a group of scrappy bounty hunters on a flying wooden boat that seems in continual danger of running out of fuel. How big a deal did he used to be? He\u2019s the artist formerly known as Yang Jian, a mighty three-eyed deity who lost his powers in a nearly apocalyptic struggle involving his family. In the tradition of American detective movies, the big job he and his team lands forces him to grapple with his traumatic past. There are fun characters and dazzling action sequences. The filmmakers\u2019 approach to rethinking legendary figures and placing them in a kind of timeless, weirdly teched-out reality is intriguing. It looks like the \u201cNew Gods\u201d franchise is meant to be the Chinese animated answer to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and it\u2019s certainly got the deep bench of stories to compete at that level. It\u2019s also got the filmmaking talent. The movie is a visual knockout. The environs aren\u2019t just photorealistic, they\u2019re bursting with creativity and often effectively create emotion. Among the sumptuous sequences: the flying wooden ship traveling through a multicolored magic passage/wormhole; the poetic tableau as one character dies on a moonlit, winter night; a languid shot of a character walking down a hall, captured through translucent silk curtains. The creatures are designed with electric inspiration. So are the combat sequences \u2014 some influenced by the kung-fu oeuvres of Jet Li and Jackie Chan, some magic and cosmic without losing tension (as so often happens with flying people shooting beams at each other). One sequence seems visually influenced by Scott Derrickson\u2019s \u201c Doctor Strange \u201d without feeling derivative. As to the film\u2019s messages beyond being a ripping yarn updating mythology for fun and profit, things get significantly murkier. If there\u2019s a real-world metaphor in the central conflict, it could be a polemic against governmental regulation of climate change. It could also be essentially the opposite: an argument for what is natural against what is approved by leaders. But whatever else one comes away with, \u201cNew Gods: Yang Jian\u201d belongs alongside the more visually striking recent animated features.

    "content": "A song-and-dance troupe of pooping toy unicorns could be in steaming hot trouble, legally speaking, all because the lil' stinkers did a send-up of a huge Black Eyed Peas hit. Let us explain \u2026 a company called MGA Entertainment created a popular line of toys -- dancing unicorns that excrete sparkling slime called Poopsie Slime Surprise. Every kid's fantasy, right? In order to market the lil\u2019 poopers, MGA ran a bunch of ads with animated unicorns singing and dancing to a song called \"My Poops\" \u2013 featuring the catchy hook \"my poops, my poops, my poops, my sparkly glitter poops!\" If that banger sounds familiar, that's because it\u2019s a play on BEP's classic \"My Humps,\" and that's what lead to a lawsuit. Will.i.am and co's record label and music publishing company, BMG, owns the majority of the copyright to the 2005 smash hit, and it claims \"My Poops\" clearly rips off the melody, tempo, chord progression, and even features a vocalist who sounds a lot like Fergie . BMG says MGA never got the rights to use the song, and now it wants at least $10 MILLION in damages. If that sounds a bit high, it\u2019s worth remembering that \"My Humps\" was a HUGE hit, garnering more than 700 million views on YouTube alone and taking home the award for Best Hip Hop Video at the 2006 MTV Video Music Awards. If BMG ends up winning even a fraction of the $10 mil in court, this could be the most expensive poop joke in history! We reached out to MGA for comment \u2026 so far, no word back. The real shocker -- as God is our witness we thought unicorns pooped rainbows. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",

    "description": "Raw emotion makes up for a lack of an overarching vision in the Icelandic film about four wayward young boys.",
    "content": "In much the way you\u2019re never really prepared for the bursts of violence and abuse in the Icelandic drama \u201cBeautiful Beings,\u201d about a quartet of wayward teenage boys from broken homes, you\u2019re also shocked by their moments of tenderness toward each other, like the strange flower nestled in cracked pavement that both beautifies and intensifies its unlikely location. Such is the seesawing mood of hair-trigger adolescent sensitivity \u2014 to smash, or to cry \u2014 that writer-director Gu\u00f0mundur Arnar Gu\u00f0mundsson seeks to explore with his mostly arresting second film , which is also his second feature about the inner lives of kids (2016\u2019s \u201cHeartstone\u201d). An often tense release-valve scenario flecked with moments of dream imagery and lyrical naturalism, \u201cBeautiful Beings\u201d certainly positions Gu\u00f0mundsson as one of the more thoughtful chroniclers of the awkward age, even if he never quite knows how to corral his many moods into something wholly resonant about the nihilistic trap of delinquency. (The film was Iceland\u2019s submission this year for the international film Oscar, but didn\u2019t make the shortlist.) For your safety The Times is committed to reviewing theatrical film releases during the COVID-19 pandemic . Because moviegoing carries risks during this time, we remind readers to follow health and safety guidelines as outlined by the CDC and local health officials . Narrating our way in is Addi (Birgir Dagur Bjarkason), a sharp-eyed, wiry blond who runs in a misfit trio that includes goofy, bratty Siggi (Snorri Rafn Fr\u00edmannsson) and hot-headed hooligan-in-training Konni (Viktor Ben\u00f3n\u00fd Benediktsson), whose go-to reaction is punching. After seeing a news report about a relentlessly bullied schoolmate recovering from an assault, Addi finds himself drawn to said kid, Baldur (\u00c1skell Einar P\u00e1lmason), introduced to us separately as a scrawny loner living in squalor with an often-absent mother (\u00cdsger\u00f0ur Gunnarsd\u00f3ttir). To the astonishment of his mates, Addi invites \u201cBalli\u201d to hang with them. It could be out of boredom, or because even a pathetic outcast\u2019s parent-less pigsty is a better place to congregate than their own undesirable homes \u2014 and nervous, jittery Balli endures plenty humiliation from the others before he feels comfortable. But we sense Addi is at a stage where an extended gesture of potential friendship is of greater interest to him than getting into one more bloody scrap with other kids (usually spurred by Konni\u2019s terrifying behavior). Besides, after years of rolling his eyes at the clairvoyant ramblings of his attentive but mentally troubled single mom (An\u00edta Briem), Addi has begun having his own strange visions: a dream of domestic peace, or a glimpse at the future\u2019s potential violence, but sometimes just an ominous black smoke lurking in the corner. The supernatural interludes aren\u2019t nearly as effective, however, as the more thickly present scenes of hormonal restlessness and intuitive socialization: shared cigarettes, stupid humor, lit fuses that are better off extinguished (there are some gnarly, pulse-quickening melees), and those moments of affection \u2014 helping Balli look presentable, calming Konni \u2014 that suggest they\u2019re inching toward figuring something out about the cusp of adulthood. The pacing is sometimes shaggy, and the boys\u2019 motivations are occasionally mysterious, but Gu\u00f0mundsson\u2019s young actors are magnetic in a physical, haunted way, and the talented Norwegian cinematographer Sturla Brandth Gr\u00f8vlen finds a dankness of texture and color that punctuates everything from sweat and light on pasty skin to the general grey/green gloom of the boys\u2019 neighborhood. As for how Gu\u00f0mundsson handles the story\u2019s more brutal turns, it\u2019s hard not to sense the whiff of trauma as sensationalistic, even if the performances (especially Benediktsson\u2019s and P\u00e1lmason\u2019s) are solid enough to do the necessary heavy lifting. Some cruelties in wretched lives don\u2019t need explicitness for us to grasp their impact. And in the case of the reappearance of Balli\u2019s abusive stepfather Svenni (a commanding \u00d3lafur Darri \u00d3lafsson), which shakes up the molecules in that house and among the boys, a deterministic plotting regrettably takes over in the last half hour. Until that point, \u201cBeautiful Beings\u201d and its unhurried atmosphere of caring realism had been doing quite well without it.

    "description": "Netflix announced Thursday that its founder Reed Hastings is stepping down as co-CEO at the company and will serve as executive chairman. Hastings will be replaced by co-CEOs Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters.",
    "content": "Netflix announced Thursday that its founder Reed Hastings is stepping down as co-CEO at the company and will serve as executive chairman. Hastings will be replaced by co-CEOs Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters. \u201cOur board has been discussing succession planning for many years (even founders need to evolve!),\u201d Hastings wrote in a blog post on Thursday. \u201cAs part of that process, we promoted Ted to co-CEO alongside me in July 2020, and Greg to Chief Operating Officer \u2014 and in the last 2\u00bd years I\u2019ve increasingly delegated the management of Netflix to them.\u201d Hastings founded Netflix (NFLX) in 1997 and changed the way countless households watched movies and shows, first with its DVD-by-mail business and later with its streaming video service. Under Hastings\u2019 leadership, Netflix disrupted legacy movie rental companies like Blockbuster and helped shake up Hollywood by kicking off an arms race investing in original content. It also survived a notable misstep in 2011 when the company briefly planned to spin off its streaming service from its DVD business, with the latter to be re-branded as Qwikster. Netflix plans its biggest-ever slate of Korean content Last year, however, Netflix saw its stock and reputation take a hit after losing subscribers amid heightened competition from rival streaming services. In response, Netflix introduced a lower-priced, ad-supported tier for the first time in its history. Those changes may be paying off. In its earnings report on Thursday, the streamer said it added more than 7.6 million subscribers during the final three months of last year, well above the 4.5 million additions it had projected, for a total of more than 230 million paying subscribers worldwide. The company said the quarter\u2019s results indicate that its growth is reaccelerating, thanks in part to popular original programming like \u201cWednesday\u201d and \u201cHarry & Meghan.\u201d It also said that its ad-supported subscription offering, which launched in November, has gained traction. \u201cIt\u2019s still early days for ads and we have lots to do,\u201d the company wrote in a letter to shareholders. But it noted that engagement is better than what it had expected and \u201cwe believe the lower price point is driving incremental membership growth.\u201d Netflix also said it plans to \u201cstart rolling out paid sharing more broadly\u201d later this quarter, as part of its effort to crackdown on people who share passwords rather than pay for their own accounts. The company posted December quarter revenue of more than $7.8 billion, up just 1.9% from the prior year but in line with Wall Street analysts\u2019 expectations. For the current quarter, Netflix is forecasting revenue growth of 4%, driven in part by a modest increase in paid net subscription additions, a reversal from the slight decrease in subscriptions during the first quarter of last year. Shares of Netflix rose around 6% in after-hours trading following the Thursday report. \u201cReed Hastings stepping down from his current role raises a lot of questions about Netflix\u2019s future strategy,\u201d Jamie Lumbley, analyst at investment firm Third Bridge, said in a statement. \u201cWhile the subscriber growth numbers are encouraging, revenue growth is sluggish with the backdrop of a potential recession looming on everyone\u2019s mind.\u201d While Hastings\u2019 move away from the CEO spot represents the end of an era of sorts, Netflix said the leadership change \u201cmakes formal externally how we have been operating internally.\u201d And Hastings added in his blog post that Sarandos and Peters have \u201ccomplementary skill sets, deep knowledge of entertainment and technology, and proven track record at Netflix.\u201d Sarandos has led Netflix\u2019s content operations since 2000, and pioneered the company\u2019s transition into producing original content in 2013. In the process, he has emerged as not just a key leader at Netflix but a power player in Hollywood. Peters worked both as the COO and the chief product officer for Netflix prior to Thursday\u2019s promotion. He previously served as the streaming giant\u2019s international development officer, helping to expand the company\u2019s overseas distribution. \u201cSince Reed started to delegate management to us, Greg and I have built a strong operating model based on our shared values and like-minded approach to growth,\u201d Sarandos said in a statement. \u201cI am so excited to start this new chapter with Greg as co-CEO.\u201d",

    "content": "Golden Knights left wing center Chandler Stephenson views the 40- to 60-game mark of the NHL season as the \u201cdog days,\u201d with teams fighting to maintain their play while waiting for the trade deadline. The Knights are feeling it now. They\u2019ve lost three of four entering Thursday\u2019s 7 p.m. matchup with the Detroit Red Wings at T-Mobile Arena. Another loss will see the Knights drop three straight for the first time this season. The banged-up squad \u2014 which is missing captain Mark Stone, left wing William Carrier and defensemen Shea Theodore and Zach Whitecloud, among others \u2014 is trying to shake the skid without gripping its sticks too tight. The Knights did keep it loose in practice the past two days. Rookie Paul Cotter was pranked Wednesday, with his stuff spread all over the locker room at City National Arena. Right wing Jonathan Marchessault also provided a light moment in Thursday\u2019s morning skate when he back-checked during a drill when he wasn\u2019t supposed to because center Nicolas Roy bumped him in the offensive zone. \u201cJust little things like that to get everybody laughing, get everybody cheering,\u201d Stephenson said. \u201cYou just want to have that energy, have that fun. I think we lost that. We\u2019re just trying to get that back. I think that once we do, you\u2019re not going to remember this stretch.\u201d The Knights\u2019 opponent gives them an opportunity to bring their record during this homestand back to even. They\u2019re 2-3 with two games remaining and 13-12 at T-Mobile Arena overall. The Red Wings have the fourth-fewest points in the Eastern Conference and are 0-2-1 in their past three games. The Knights beat them 4-1 on Dec. 23 in Detroit, with goaltender Adin Hill making 24 saves. The 26-year-old is expected to start Thursday. Starting goaltender information for the Red Wings was not available. \u201cThey\u2019re a team that\u2019s still trying to find their way right now,\u201d Knights coach Bruce Cassidy said. \u201cThey had a good start to the year, gave back some ground. Now they\u2019re on a road trip where I think they\u2019re fighting to find their game.\u201d Knights vs. Red Wings (7 p.m.) TV : AT&T SportsNet Radio : KKGK (98.9 FM, 1340 AM) Line : Knights -176; total 6\u00bd Knights record : 28-15-2 Red Wings record : 18-17-8 Head-to-head : Knights 1-0-0 Knights\u2019 projected lineup : Chandler Stephenson \u2014 Jack Eichel \u2014 Phil Kessel Reilly Smith \u2014 William Karlsson \u2014 Jonathan Marchessault Jonas Rondbjerg \u2014 Byron Froese \u2014 Michael Amadio Paul Cotter \u2014 Nicolas Roy \u2014 Keegan Kolesar Nic Hague \u2014 Alex Pietrangelo Brayden McNabb \u2014 Kaedan Korczak Alec Martinez \u2014 Ben Hutton Adin Hill Contact Ben Gotz at bgotz@reviewjournal.com.

    "description": "While cinematographer Halyna Hutchins' family praised criminal charges against 'Rust' star Alec Baldwin and the film's armorer, the industry was mum.",
    "content": "The family of \u201cRust\u201d cinematographer Halyna Hutchins says it is \u201ca comfort\u201d that no one in New Mexico is above the law following the decision to bring criminal charges against actor-producer Alec Baldwin and the film\u2019s armorer. More than 15 months after Hutchins\u2019 2021 shooting death , Baldwin and \u201cRust\u201d weapons handler Hannah Gutierrez Reed are facing felony charges related to the October 2021 incident . Baldwin, 64, who stars in and is a producer on the low-budget western, was charged Thursday with two counts of involuntary manslaughter and Gutierrez Reed, who loaded the prop gun that was fired by Baldwin, is facing involuntary manslaughter charges. Assistant director David Halls reached a plea agreement on a misdemeanor charge in connection with the fatal shooting, which also wounded director Joel Souza. Company Town More than a year after \u201cRust\u201d cinematographer Halyna Hutchins was fatally shot on the film\u2019s set near Santa Fe, star-producer Alec Baldwin and the movie\u2019s armorer are being charged in her death. In a statement issued through an attorney , Hutchins\u2019 family thanked the Santa Fe sheriff and the district attorney for their \u201cthorough investigation\u201d and determining that the charges are \u201cwarranted for the killing of Halyna Hutchins with conscious disregard for human life.\u201d The family added, \u201cWe support the charges, will fully cooperate with this prosecution, and fervently hope the justice system works to protect the public and hold accountable those who break the law.\u201d An attorney for Baldwin on Thursday called the promised criminal charges a \u201cterrible miscarriage of justice\u201d and said \u201cwe will fight these charges, and we will win.\u201d Entertainment & Arts Facing criminal charges in the shooting of Halyna Hutchins on the set of \u2018Rust,\u2019 Alec Baldwin is likely to see his damaged career erode even further. Initial reactions to the shooting were swift and met with shock by Hollywood. Many celebrities called for better gun safety on sets as word traveled that people in New Mexico\u2019s tightknit film industry who worked on the \u201cRust\u201d set had walked out in protest of poor working conditions. Since then, however, developments in the long-running case have been met with a quieter response within the industry \u2014 but with not complete silence. SAG/AFTRA, the actors union, had a strong reaction slamming the decision. \u201cThe prosecutor\u2019s contention that an actor has a duty to ensure the functional and mechanical operation of a firearm on a production set is wrong and uninformed,\u201d the guild said in a statement. \u201cAn actor\u2019s job is not to be a firearms or weapons expert. Firearms are provided for their use under the guidance of multiple expert professionals directly responsible for the safe and accurate operation of that firearm. In addition, the employer is always responsible for providing a safe work environment at all times, including hiring and supervising the work of professionals trained in weapons.\u201d In a lengthy Twitter thread , Kirk Acevedo, an actor who has appeared in HBO\u2019s \u201cBand of Brothers,\u201d Fox\u2019s \u201cFringe\u201d and the CW\u2019s \u201cArrow,\u201d called Baldwin\u2019s incoming involuntary manslaughter charge \u201cthe most ridiculous charge ever\u201d and placed blame squarely on Gutierrez Reed. Citing his own experiences, he tweeted : \u201cThe majority of those actors never fired a real gun in their lives and those who did still had zero clue on how to properly hold or fire a live weapon let alone the prop weapons we were given. It was up to the technical advisors we had on those sets to show us or the armorer.\u201d California The charges expected against Alec Baldwin in the shooting of \u201cRust\u201d cinematographer Halyna Hutchins demonstrate the challenges of involuntary manslaughter prosecutions. \u201cThe Good Wife\u201d creator Robert King wrote in two tweets : \u201cTo charge Alec Baldwin as a producer is one thing, but to charge him as an actor seems to misunderstand the chain of responsibility on a movie set. If you\u2019re charging the actor, you should be charging the director, all producers, prop master, many others. The fact the DA didn\u2019t seems to suggest she\u2019s trying to make a name for herself.\u201d \u201c@sagaftra needs to demand use of fake weapons henceforth with effects done in post,\u201d \u201cAbbott Elementary\u201d actress Lisa Ann Walter tweeted . \u201cI\u2019ll be making the motion at the next National Board Meeting.\u201d California Sen. Dave Cortese (D-San Jose) said he once again plans to reintroduce legislation this year to establish safety standards in Hollywood after attempts to pass new laws failed in 2022. He said an alliance of studios and unions failed to find common ground to back changes. \u201cI\u2019ve been working with stakeholders and leaders in the industry, including many entertainment workers, to push these real reforms forward and to avoid yet another tragedy on set,\u201d Cortese said in a statement. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve learned is this is an issue that needs to be addressed across the industry, rather than incident-by-incident, to bolster safety as a whole and ensure we keep productions safe for everyone.\u201d \u201cToday\u2019s news reinforces the fact that anyone on set can be the tragic victim of the lack of statutory safety protocols,\u201d Cortese added. The charging decision comes three months after Baldwin and the film\u2019s other producers struck a proposed settlement agreement with Hutchins\u2019 family to end the wrongful death civil lawsuit filed early last year. The family initially blamed Hutchins\u2019 death on cost-cutting measures and reckless behavior by Baldwin and others. Meanwhile, right-wing pundits who have long been critical of Baldwin\u2019s liberal views \u2014 and his Emmy-winning impersonation of former President Trump \u2014 reacted with glee to the legal fallout. \u201cGreat to see that Alec Baldwin is at long last being charged for killing that young woman. I hope they throw the book at him because he demonstrated dishonesty and utter lack of humility every day thereafter,\u201d tweeted conservative commentator Candace Owens, who clashed with Baldwin\u2019s daughter Ireland on Twitter in the days after the shooting. Here\u2019s a sampling of the mixed reaction to Thursday\u2019s charges: Involuntary Manslaughter?! This is the most ridiculous charge ever. I understand he was a producer but every single producer on the movie should be held accountable for safety measures not being enforced not just Baldwin. The Armorer is 100% at fault here\u2026 Virtually every film we see today has gunfire in it; yet a mistake like this happened on this movie set. Of course actors use guns handed to them\u2014they are following a script. Blaming the actor is bizarre. https://t.co/GR4cwSoMWP I\u2019ve said this before, and still strongly believe it. The industry has strict protocol when guns are anywhere near set, if those were followed she would be alive today. Her tragedy is the result of failing to maintain a safe working environment in an attempt to save money. Santa Fe District Attorney well-within the law in New Mexico to charge Alex Baldwin with Involuntary Manslaughter. I feel badly for all, but his gun had a live round, he should have checked weapon before he pulled the trigger, and it was criminally negligent not to do so. To all Hollywood elites your feelings don\u2019t matter the truth does Maybe Alec Baldwin will be lucky enough to share a cell with Michael Avenatti. i guess we'll found out more but i still don't totally understand how what happened is Alec Baldwin's fault if someone handed him a loaded gun and told him it was unloaded. Hey, it's kinda weird to be excited about the Alec Baldwin news. Great to see that Alec Baldwin is at long last being charged for killing that young woman. I hope they throw the book at him because he demonstrated dishonesty and utter lack of humility every day thereafter. They just threw the book at Alec Baldwin. Not only is he facing an involuntary manslaughter charge but they added another option which would increase the sentence from up to 18 months, to a five year MANDATORY sentence. It is not the responsibility of the actor. For an artist to be handed a prop gun, and told its completely safe, and then held responsible when it's not, is outrageous. Actors play scenes. Armorers and prop people make sure props are safe. Times staff writers Meg James, Wendy Lee, Anousha Sakoui and Christie D'Zurilla contributed to this report.",

    "description": "A former Tennessee correctional officer could receive $160,000 in back pay and damages after he was forced to resign for taking Suboxone to treat his opioid use disorder.",
    "content": "NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) \u2014 A former Tennessee correctional officer will receive $160,000 in back pay and damages after he was forced to resign for taking Suboxone to treat his opioid use disorder, if a judge approves a landmark consent decree filed in federal court in Nashville on Wednesday. It is the first time the U.S. Department of Justice has used the Americans with Disabilities Act to settle a claim that an employee was discriminated against for taking a prescribed medication to treat drug addiction, according to the Department. Advertisement It comes less than a year after the Justice Department\u2019s Civil Rights Division issued new guidelines advising that employers, health care providers, law enforcement agencies that operate jails, and others are violating the ADA if they discriminate against people taking prescription medications to treat opioid use disorder. The Department noted federal law does not protect people who are using illegal drugs. In the present case, the complainant, who is not identified by name, was hired as a correctional officer at the Cumberland County jail in January 2015. He received positive employment evaluations and was even promoted, but when a drug screen showed he was taking Suboxone to treat his opioid addiction in 2018, he was given the choice of resigning or being fired for drug use. The complaint filed in federal court Wednesday claims a Cumberland County\u2019s sheriff\u2019s office policy prohibiting employees from being on controlled substances while at work \u201cfails to make individualized assessments of its employees\u2019 ability to perform the essential functions of their jobs ... when they are taking legally prescribed medications.\u201d In addition to providing $160,000 to the former employee, the county has agreed to revise its employment policies and implement training around ADA compliance as part of a consent decree also filed Wednesday. The decree won\u2019t become final until approved by a judge. An initial case management conference is scheduled for Friday. Advertisement Drugs like Suboxone often carry a stigma because they contain opioids, but Dr. Marc Stern, a correctional physician who is on faculty at the University of Washington School of Public Health, said they should not. \u201cWhen these drugs are prescribed for someone who has a disorder, it helps them be normal. It helps them be healthy. It helps them to hold a job,\u201d Stern said. \u201cMore importantly, the Department of Justice has spoken, and this is the law. It\u2019s not up to employers to decide whether they like it or not.\u201d Because of how opioids act on the brain, people dependent on them get sick if they stop using. Withdrawal can feel like a bad flu with cramping, sweating, anxiety and sleeplessness. Cravings for the drug can last for years and be so intense that relapse is common. Suboxone is a common form of buprenorphine, a gold standard medicine approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration that reduces cravings. Overdose deaths in the U.S. remain at near-record levels. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that overdoses contributed to more than 107,000 deaths in the 12 months that ended Aug. 31. Opioids were involved in more than 81,000 of those. The proposed consent decree in Tennessee comes as President Joe Biden \u2019s administration pushes for greater access to addiction treatment. Most recently, Biden signed a law eliminating the need for doctors to get a special waiver to prescribe buprenorphine. He has also released a national drug control strategy that, for the first time, prioritizes preventing death and illness in drug users while trying to engage them in care and treatment.

    "description": "Netflix's co-founder Reed Hastings is leaving his co-CEO role and will stay on as executive chairman. Greg Peters, chief operating officer, has been promoted to co-CEO and will share that title with Ted Sarandos.",
    "content": "Reed Hastings is stepping aside as co-chief executive of Netflix, the streaming giant said Thursday, in a significant leadership change that the company says completes its succession plan. Hastings, also a Netflix co-founder, is now the Los Gatos, Calif., company\u2019s executive chairman. Greg Peters, Netflix\u2019s chief operating officer, has been promoted to co-CEO, a title he now shares with Ted Sarandos, in a changing of the guard at the world\u2019s largest subscription streaming firm. The move is the culmination of a gradual ceding of day-to-day authority by Hastings, who has been with the firm throughout its evolution from a DVD-by-mail upstart to a disruptive Hollywood powerhouse with a massive original content operation. \u201c[Hastings] leaves some big shoes for Greg and I to fill,\u201d Sarandos said in a recorded interview to discuss earnings. \u201cFortunately, we have four feet to do it with.\u201d In a blog post, Hastings said he has increasingly delegated management of Netflix to Peters and Sarandos over the last 2\u00bd years. Netflix said in a letter to shareholders that the transition \u201cmakes formal externally how we have been operating internally.\u201d \u201cIt was a baptism by fire, given COVID and recent challenges within our business,\u201d Hastings said. \u201cBut they\u2019ve both managed incredibly well, ensuring Netflix continues to improve and developing a clear path to reaccelerate our revenue and earnings growth. So the board and I believe it\u2019s the right time to complete my succession.\u201d The change comes as Netflix tries to accelerate its growth, which slowed significantly last year, as it faced increasing competition in the marketplace from players including Walt Disney Co.'s Disney+ and Hulu, Apple\u2019s Apple TV+ and Warner Bros. Discovery\u2019s HBO Max. The early days of the pandemic caused a major surge in streaming sign-ups as consumers were sheltered at home, but since then subscriber growth has slowed down, causing investors to question its business model. The company reported slower revenue growth Thursday for its most recent quarter as streaming services look to trim costs amid a possible looming recession and the company takes steps to accelerate its business by rolling out a cheaper ad-supported plan and charging customers for password sharing. The company said its fourth-quarter revenue increased 2% to $7.85 billion, missing analysts estimates of $7.86 billion, according to FactSet. Its growth was slower than in previous quarters. Revenue jumped 6% to $7.9 billion in the third quarter. Fourth-quarter net income was $55 million, down from $607 million in the same period a year earlier. Full-year revenue in 2022 totaled $31.6 billion, up 6% from the year before. That\u2019s a marked slowdown from 2021, when sales increased 19% to $29.7 billion. \u201c2022 was a tough year, with a bumpy start but a brighter finish,\u201d Netflix said in a letter to shareholders Thursday. \u201cWe believe we have a clear path to reaccelerate our revenue growth: continuing to improve all aspects of Netflix, launching paid sharing and building our ads offering. As always, our north stars remain pleasing our members and building even greater profitability over time.\u201d Some of Netlfix\u2019s moves are bearing fruit. Netflix increased its subscribers by 7.7 million to 231 million customers during the quarter, beating analyst estimates of 4.57 million subscribers added. Popular shows that helped draw large audiences included \u201c Wednesday \u201d featuring characters from the Addams Family that was released in November, the Rian Johnson murder-comedy movie \u201c Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery\u201d in December and the recent royal docuseries \u201cHarry & Meghan.\u201d \u201cWednesday\u201d has become the third-most watched show of all time on Netflix, viewed more than 1.2 billion hours in its first 28 days on the streaming service, according to Netflix company data, behind only \u201cSquid Game\u201d and \u201cStranger Things 4.\u201d \u201cWednesday\u201d has been renewed for a second season. Meanwhile, \u201cGlass Onion\u201d ranked as Netflix\u2019s fourth-most popular English-language movie, drawing 273 million hours of viewing time by audiences. The results support Netflix executives\u2019 assurances to investors that their business has stabilized after losing subscribers in the first half of last year and laying off hundreds of staffers. Still, some analysts believe that the market for streaming services \u2014 once businesses of massive growth during the early days of the pandemic \u2014 may soon reach its saturation point. Company Town As Netflix\u2019s stock declines and investors ramp up pressure to continue to expand its customer base, ads on Netflix will soon become a reality. Netflix and Warner Bros. Discovery are canceling shows after previously renewing them for subsequent seasons, as they look to manage costs while still appealing to audiences. The two men who will run the company moving forward, Peters and Sarandos, are longtime Netflix executives. Sarandos has been the chief architect of Netflix\u2019s original programming strategy , while Peters has been overseeing the building of the company\u2019s efforts in advertising, gaming and monetizing password sharing \u2014 seen as new areas to generate revenue. \u201cThis is the right move at the right time,\u201d said Maribel Lopez, founder and principal analyst of Lopez Research, adding that Hastings was the CEO for subscriber growth, but now Netflix is transitioning to a leader focused on products meant to boost revenue per customer. \u201cRunning in a maturing market requires different skills than running a company for scale.\u201d Sarandos was promoted to co-CEO in July 2020 and has moved past controversy in 2021 surrounding transphobic content in a Dave Chappelle special that upset Netflix employees. Key people in charge of Netflix\u2019s content strategy were rewarded with promotions and loftier titles Thursday. Bela Bajaria was named chief content officer. She was previously head of global TV. Scott Stuber, previously head of global films, is now chairman of Netflix film. Succession planning has not always come easily to major media and entertainment companies. In 2020, Disney announced that its longtime CEO Bob Iger was stepping down to become executive chairman, while his handpicked successor Bob Chapek would take on the CEO role. In November, the Disney board fired Chapek and replaced him with Iger for a two-year term. There are challenges ahead for Netflix, including the continue ramp-up of competition in both the subscription and advertising markets. \u201cReed has certainly won the war over the last two decades but the battles on content appeal relative to competitors and entering a very competitive AVOD (advertising video on demand) market will be intense,\u201d said Matthew Harrigan, a senior equity research analyst at Benchmark, who has a sell rating on the stock. To attract cost-conscious consumers, Netflix in November rolled out a cheaper, ad-supported subscription for $6.99 a month in 12 countries. In the U.S., Netflix with ads costs $6.99 a month. It was the first time the streamer offered ads after years of being reluctant to do so. Its competitors, including HBO Max, Peacock and Paramount+, had already offered lower cost video streaming options with ads. Netflix said that it was pleased with the early results from its ad plans and that there was very little switching among its ad-free subscribers to the lower-cost plan with commercials. \u201cWhile it\u2019s still early days for ads and we have lots to do (in particular better targeting and measurement), we are pleased with our progress to date across every dimension: member experience, value to advertisers, and incremental contribution to our business,\u201d Netflix said in its letter to shareholders. Some analysts believe Netflix is well positioned because big brands will be willing to spend to get access to the streamer\u2019s large audience. In a report from financial services firm Cowen & Co., 41% of 50 ad buyers it asked said they anticipate their largest client would advertise on Netflix this year. Still, some analysts are skeptical about how popular Netflix\u2019s ad-supported plan will become. Company Town Some industry analysts are scratching their heads over what they say was a missed opportunity for Netflix to capture more box office dollars had it gone with a wider theatrical run. \u201cI think it remains to be seen what happens,\u201d Harrigan said. \u201cIt isn\u2019t like they\u2019re doing something different than everyone else. They\u2019re actually playing catch-up on the advertising side.\u201d Netflix\u2019s stock closed at $315.78 on Thursday, down 3%. In after-hours trading, Netflix stock rose 7% to $338.95.",

    "content": "A college student has used Open AI's chatbot called ChatGPT to write an essay about burqa bans that they then submitted for grading. According to a report from The New York Times , the student confessed to using the chatbot to write the essay after their teacher, philosophy professor Antony Aumann from Northern Michigan University, busted them. Aumann explained to Futurism that the student was instructed to rewrite the essay, which is what is done the majority of the time in plagiarism cases. Chatbots such as OpenAI's ChatGPT are free and have very powerful capabilities that are resulted in them going viral. ChatGPT is an artificial intelligence designed to have human-like conversations where it remembers what was talked about earlier in the conversation. Additionally, users make improvements to the AI's answers, write code, essays, format data, create programs, and more. An example of a prompt would be, 'write an essay on burqa bans'. A more simpler request could be, 'Got any creative ideas for a 10 year old's birthday?' The emergence of these AI systems has caused education departments to make changes across learning programs as these chatbots are available to anyone that has an internet connection. Many school boards have chosen to redesign courses to combat the rise of AI and are getting students to submit their work in handwritten form or oral exams. Notably, both The New York City and Seattle public school systems have outright banned the use of ChatGPT on school networks/devices. However, universities aren't likely to follow in the same fashion, with Aumann explaining that universities want to give faculty members the freedom to respond to ChatGPT how they see fit. The professor of philosophy also said that ignoring ChatGPT and trying to prevent it is pointless since it is already here and widely available. Essentially saying it's too late to stop it. Instead, Aumann hopes to teach students to think for themselves and not \" mindlessly defer to others. \" Aumann is telling his philosophy student to \" react to ChatGPT in the same way they would any other philosophical source \", which will lead to students having to provide reasons and arguments behind its existence. Furthermore, the development of AI is compounding, which will only improve the likelihood of student abuse and make it even more challenging to detect. Educators will need to do what they can to adapt to the new world of artificial intelligence being available to everyone.",

According to a Reuters report , the incident was described in a Jan. 19 court filing which they said underscored the security risks faced by the FTX founder and those linked to him, including the two individuals who secured Bankman-Fried\u2019s $250 million bond, stating: The lawyers however didn\u2019t specify the date or time at which the incident took place. On Jan. 12, lawyers representing some of the largest U.S. media outlets \u2014 including Bloomberg, CNBC, Reuters and the Financial Times \u2014 wrote a letter to U.S. District Court judge Lewis Kaplan to request for the names of the guarantors. The media\u2019s lawyers argued the public\u2019s right to know Bankman-Fried\u2019s guarantors significantly outweighed their privacy and safety rights. Given that Bankman-Fried shares close ties to some of the wealthiest and most politically-connected individuals on the planet, the lawyers argued that such non-disclosure could undermine public confidence in U.S. government institutions. Related: FTX profited from Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s inflated coins: Report Bankman-Fried was extradited to the U.S. in December and pleaded not guilty to all eight fraud and conspiracy-based charges laid against him on January 3, 2023. All charges relate to his alleged involvement in FTX\u2019s catastrophic collapse in November. The controversial figure remains under house arrest at his parent\u2019s California home until his trial date, which is set for October 2, 2023.",

    "content": "NVIDIA provided an engineering sample of the new GeForce RTX 4090 laptop GPU to Jarrod'sTech to compare it to the last gen laptop flagship, the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti laptop GPU. Although NVIDIA hasn't sponsored the video, it did provide both laptops, and the initial testing results are mainly limited to DLSS 3 performance in games. However, some impressive productivity results were also shown. Source: Jarrod's Tech The RTX 4090 laptop featured in the video is the impressive Razer Blade 16 for 2023, which includes an Intel Core i9 13950HX CPU and 32GB of DDR5-5600 memory. With DLSS 3 enabled, running five titles in 1440p - Portal with RTX, Microsoft Flight Simulator, A Plague Tale: Requiem, Warhammer 40,000: Darktide, and Cyberpunk 2077 - the performance increase compared to the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti laptop GPU is more than double. Going up to 2.6X in Portal and Flight Sim. Source: Jarrod's Tech As DLSS 3 uses NVIDIA's new Frame Generation technology on top of DLSS 2's Super Resolution and NVIDIA Reflex and is exclusive to the GeForce RTX 40 Series, it's not a 1-1 comparison. The RTX 3080 Ti laptop is limited to DLSS Super Resolution. The video notes this on a few occasions, though it rightfully points out that Frame Generation is an exciting tech for gaming laptops as it can push performance to crazy new levels. And for the most part, there's a significant reduction in latency, which is surprising (and very cool) to see. Due to what we assume is an embargo, Jarrod's Tech is unable to show rasterization performance for the new GeForce RTX 4090 laptop GPU - so all we get to see are these DLSS 3 results. So we'll have to wait a bit longer before we get in-game performance without additional features like DLSS or visual effects like ray-tracing enabled. Source: Jarrod's Tech When it comes to content creation tests, though, we get to see just how big of a leap the new GeForce RTX 4090 laptop GPU presents. Blender's Classroom test sees a 2X performance increase compared to the RTX 3080 Ti laptop GPU, which bumps up to an impressive 2.4X increase. Throw in the new dual NVENC encoders and AV1 video support, and the new GeForce RTX 40 Series laptops are set to boost portable creativity. GeForce RTX 4090 and RTX 4080 laptops will begin shipping on February 8.",

    "content": "\u2013 Brokers say that tickets to this Sunday's Cowboys-49ers game are some of the most expensive ever for a divisional playoff. It's making life difficult for Cowboys fans who are determined to be there. \"Gotta get on every site that I know of...trying to find the best available ticket,\" said Dallas police officer Jamie Castro. Castro never thought he would need his detective skills for this. \"Oh man I'm searching, I'm calling, I'm texting, and I'm messaging every contact that I have,\" he said. Castro wants, or to put it more accurately, has to be in the stadium when the Cowboys take on the 49ers in San Francisco on Sunday. \"I've been waiting 30 years, 30 years just for a road playoff win,\" Castro said. \"I have been to more than 210 consecutive home games I wanna be there to share the moment with them.\" You may recognize this Cowboys fan better as his alter ego, Ballz Mahoney. Castro created him more than 20 years ago and is recognized in the NFL Hall of Fame as a super fan along with his late brother, a Buffalo Bills super fan known as Pancho Billa. Castro is ready to pack his uniform for a trip to the West Coast if he can afford the high price of admission. \"At the end of the day you're looking at probably $1,500, close to $2,000 trip,\" he said. Ticket IQ says the average ticket on the resale market is going for $1,400. Castro says he paid only $300 to go to the Cowboys last road playoff game in Green Bay eight years ago and can't believe what he's seeing now. \"For divisional game tickets to be at $700 in the nose bleeds is really unheard of,\" he said. Castro says the NFL's elite group of super fans work together to help each other attend road games even if they cheer for other teams. But the game clock is about to run out on Ballz Mahoney who still hasn't scored a ticket. We are keeping our fingers crossed, but if for some reason, Castro does not make it to San Francisco, he plans to be dressed in character at one of the watch parties at The Star or outside AT&T Stadium.",

    "description": "One-in-five new cars sold in California in 2022 was a zero-emission vehicle, the state said Friday, as the largest car market in the United States charges towards its goal of electrifying its fleet.",
    "content": "January 21, 2023 by Huw GRIFFITH One-in-five new cars sold in California in 2022 was a zero-emission vehicle, the state said Friday, as the largest car market in the United States charges towards its goal of electrifying its fleet. Last year officials set ambitious targets for boosting the number of electric vehicles (EVs) and plug-in hybrid vehicles (PHEVs) on the roads, as they look to slash planet-warming gases produced by combustion engines . The California Air Resources Board announced in August the sale of new gasoline and diesel-powered cars would be eliminated by 2035, setting an aggressive timeline to phase them out. On Friday the California Energy Commission said 18.8 percent of new cars sold in the state in 2022 were EVs, PHEVs or fuel cell electric vehicles, all of which California includes in its zero-emission category. Ten years ago, that figure was two percent. \"California continues to lead the zero-emission vehicle revolution with groundbreaking policies and investments that drive innovation, create good jobs and expand (zero-emission vehicle) access and affordability across the state,\" said Governor Gavin Newsom. \"Keeping our focus on the communities that are most impacted by the intensifying climate crisis, we'll keep pushing ahead to make our clean transportation future a reality in California.\" Data showed Tesla continued to dominate the market for EVs, with around two-thirds of the 346,000 zero-emission vehicles sold in the year being made by Elon Musk's company. California already accounts for the lion's share of electric vehicles in the United States, with 1.4 million of them on the state's roads, and around 40 percent of all ZEV sales in the US are in the state. Their popularity has mushroomed in the years since they were seen as little more than novelty golf carts for tree-huggers who were content to drive no more than a few dozen miles (kilometers). Mainstream manufacturers like Ford and Mercedes are rushing headlong into the market, producing everything from small runarounds to luxury sedans to heavy duty pick-ups. Still, the vehicles remain more expensive than their fossil fuel-powered equivalents, and critics say only federal subsidies of up to $7,500 make them viable for many buyers. But supporters say the incentives are necessary short-term supports that will fade away as increased adoption boosts economies of scale and drives down prices. As the biggest auto market in the United States, California has an outsized influence on national standards . Environmentalists hope that as manufacturers fall into line with California's rules and produce more attractive, cheaper EVs, opposition from less liberal states will be overcome, and America can be weaned off its addiction to gas-guzzling cars. Human-caused global warming has already raised average temperatures around the planet, affecting weather patterns and worsening natural hazards like wildfires and storms. Scientists say dramatic action is required to limit the damage, and point to curbing emissions from fossil fuels as key to the battle. \u00a9 2023 AFP",

    "content": "January 21, 2023 by Randall Chase The judge presiding over the bankruptcy of cryptocurrency exchange FTX has approved the company's choice of a law firm representing it in the bankruptcy, despite concerns about potential conflicts of interest. Judge John Dorsey on Friday granted a motion by FTX for the Sullivan & Cromwell law firm to serve as debtor's counsel. The ruling came after a Sullivan & Cromwell partner filed additional disclosures this week about the firm's work for FTX entities and FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried before the November bankruptcy filings. Those disclosures were made in response to concerns raised by the U.S. Trustee, which serves as a government watchdog in Chapter 11 reorganizations. According to declarations filed by attorney Andrew Dietderich, the firm was paid millions of dollars for work on behalf of FTX starting in July 2021. That does not include bankruptcy-related retainers totaling $12 million. Of that amount, $3 million was paid to Sullivan & Cromwell for previous work. Bankman-Fried has pleaded not guilty to charges that he illegally diverted massive amounts of customer money from FTX to Alameda Research, his cryptocurrency hedge fund trading firm. Dietderich said in a hearing last week that Bankman-Fried instructed FTX co-founder and chief technology officer Gary Wang to create a secret \"back door\" that allowed Alameda to borrow from customers on the FTX exchange without their permission. Wang and Carolyn Ellison, the former CEO of Alameda Research, have pleaded guilty to charges including wire fraud, securities fraud and commodities fraud and are cooperating with federal prosecutors . Meanwhile, Dorsey signed an order Friday authorizing FTX to redact the names of all customers, and the addresses and e-mail addresses of non-individual customers, from court filings for at least the next 90 days. FTX also is authorized to permanently keep secret the addresses and email addresses of individual creditors and equity holders. Dorsey also allowed FTX to maintain a veil of secrecy for at least the next 90 days over the names of individual creditors or equity holders who are citizens of the United Kingdom or European Union nations and covered under a consumer protection program known as the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR. Lawyers for FTX have argued that its customer list is both a valuable asset and confidential commercial information. They contend that secrecy is needed to protect FTX accounts from potential theft and to ensure that potential competitors do not \"poach\" FTX customers. \u00a9 2023 The Associated Press.

Averaging 29.7 points this season, James is closing in on Abdul-Jabbar\u2019s 38,387 points, and he has made a furious push in the past five weeks \u2013 despite missing three games since Dec. 18 \u2013 with 13 games of at least 30 points, including three 40-plus point games, topped off by 48 points against Houston on Jan. 16. At his scoring rate, James should pass Abdul-Jabbar and become the NBA\u2019s all-time leading scorer in early February. Let\u2019s take a look at James\u2019 progress: vs. Memphis, 38,127 career points Follow every game: Latest NBA Scores and Schedules Jan. 20: James scored 23 points in the Lakers' eventful and dramatic 122-121 victory over the Grizzlies, who entered riding an 11-game winning streak. vs. Sacramento, 38,104 career points Jan. 18: James had 32 points but it was in a 116-111 loss to the Kings. James played 36 minutes, and after the game, Lakers coach Darvin Ham said he needed to find a way to reduce James\u2019 minutes and get him some rest. vs. Houston, 38,072 career points Jan. 16: James scored a season-high 48 points in the Lakers\u2019 140-132 victory. In another efficient performance, James was 16-for-26 from the field, 5-for-10 on 3-pointers and 11-for-12 from the free throw line. vs. Philadelphia 38,024 career points Jan. 15: James passed the 38,000-point mark with 35 points in a 113-112 loss to the Sixers.

Julius Randle had 32 points and nine rebounds for the Knicks but was held scoreless in the final period.Murray has scored 27 or more points in four consecutive games. Young had six assists and has averaged more than nine assists in the winning streak.\"We want to be the best for each other and the best for our teammates,\" Murray said. \"We've got to be consistent. We've got to continue to want the best for each other and continue to make our teammates better.\"Hawks coach Nate McMillan said Young \"has done a nice job of really initiating the offense\" and added that Murray has \"been on fire\" during the winning streak.\"We've been playing really good, just taking what the defense is giving us,\" Young said. \"... Guys are knocking down shots, just playing free basketball.\"Atlanta acquired Murray from San Antonio before the season, and the pairing of the two All-Star guards required an adjustment. \"They're playing at a very high level right now,\" said Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau. \"They're sharing the ball and playing well together.\"De'Andre Hunter had 20 points and Okongwu scored 14 off the bench. Atlanta led only 102-101 before opening the fourth quarter with a 20-4 run that was capped by back-to-back inside baskets by Onyeka Okongwu. The Hawks outscored the Knicks 37-23 in the period.RJ Barrett scored 23 points for the seventh-place Knicks (25-22), who have a three-game losing streak. Jericho Sims started at center in New York's first game since losing Mitchell Robinson for at least three weeks. Robinson had surgery Thursday to repair his fractured right thumb suffered in Wednesday's 116-105 loss to Washington.Thibodeau was not happy with the Knicks' defense.\"You give up 139, credit to them, they're playing great basketball right now,\" said Thibodeau of the Hawks. \"But we're not going to win a game like that. ... We're not playing great defense and we've got to get back to that.\"The Hawks had center Clint Capela return this week after missing 10 consecutive games with a calf injury. McMillan said the return to the starting lineup of Capela, whose playing time has been restricted in his three games back in uniform, was important to Atlanta's defense. Even with Capela on the court, the Knicks still drove to the basket with consistency while making 30 of 42 shots from the field (71.4%) in the first half.The Knicks led 71-68 at halftime, with 38 points in the paint. Atlanta opened the second half with a 13-0 run, including nine points by Young.A 3-pointer by Young gave the Hawks a big lead of 13 points at 87-74 before the Knicks cut the deficit to 102-101 entering the final period.MISSING ROBINSON'S REBOUNDSThe 7-foot Robinson is averaging 7.2 points and 8.9 rebounds. Thibodeau said Robinson's rebounds were missed as the Hawks took a 39-34 advantage on the boards.\"The rebounding was a problem right from the start and that was a concern,\" Thibodeau said.Sims had 12 points and eight rebounds while sharing time with Isaiah Hartenstein, who had two points and six rebounds. Thibodeau said he \"went back and forth\" in deciding whether to start Sims or Hartenstein, who had been Robinson's top backup. \"Part of it was to keep some unity to the second unit,\" Thibodeau said.TIP-INSKnicks: Randle had three 3-pointers in the strong finish to the third period. Overall, New York made 13 of 30 3s, including 3 of 10 by Randle. ... Hawks: G Bogdan Bogdanovic (right knee soreness) had 14 points off the bench with his knee wrapped after he was listed as questionable in the first of back-to-back games. \"We knew that coming into the season that would be something we would have to monitor,\" McMillan said. \"We have to look at back-to-back situations.\" ...

One thing about Shaq\u2019s dominance over the league however is the fact that he never truly had to go up against the best of the best in the paint while in his prime. Hakeem Olajuwon was the best big-man he went up against but after him, guys like Dale Davis, Dikembe Mutombo, or Todd MacCulloch simply couldn\u2019t be compared to him. Also read: Shaquille O\u2019Neal aka DJ Diesel is Getting A Whole Stage on Tomorrowland! Could Steven Adams stand his ground against Shaquille O\u2019Neal? JR Smith posed an interesting question on social media. He pondered over whether or not Steven Adams could successfully hold his own over Shaquille O\u2019Neal in the post. Of course, the internet reacted the way they would and claimed that Shaq would treat him the same way he treated centers of his time. Would Adams stand @shaq up in the post if #Shaq posted him up? @ESPNNBA \u2014 JR Smith (@TheRealJRSmith) January 21, 2023 However, with the recent scuffle that has taken place between Shannon Sharpe and the Grizzlies, an interesting video has surfaced. The video shows a multitude of men trying to hold Steven Adams back from Sharpe and all of them failing to do so. not a single person in that skirmish made Steven Adams move an inch pic.twitter.com/WsgE2LCVd0 \u2014 Rob Perez (@WorldWideWob) January 21, 2023 There have also been a bevy of players across the league who have stated that Adams\u2019 screens are some of the hardest screens that have ever been set against them, analogizing it going up against a brick wall. So perhaps Adams would stand a chance against a prime Shaq. But that\u2019s all it could ever be. A \u2018chance\u2019. Shannon Sharpe and the Grizzlies get into it Shannon Sharpe has long been an avid LeBron James supporter. The two have linked up on several occasions and Sharpe\u2019s primary purpose on his show alongside Skip Bayless is to defend \u2018The King\u2019. So, when he yelled out at the Grizz that they couldn\u2019t guard him, the youngsters got heated. It started off with Dillon Brooks chirping at the NFL Hall of Famer but soon divulged into Ja Morant, Steven Adams, and Ja\u2019s dad (Tee) yelling at Sharpe. Security would have to get involved and would escort Shannon to the locker room.

Brazzo still bitter over non-call on Kimmich (SAT.1 via @iMiaSanMia) Bayern Munich sporting director Hasan \u201cBrazzo\u201d Salihamid\u017ei\u0107 is still a bit miffed over what he perceived to be a non-call on an alleged foul by Andre Silva on Joshua Kimmich during the buildup on RB Leipzig\u2019s game-tying goal on Friday. \u201cIt was a clear foul, that\u2019s all I can say about it. We can\u2019t complain about referee, even though he didn\u2019t have his best day. It\u2019s more our fault that we didn\u2019t win,\u201d Salihamid\u017ei\u0107 said. Referee Daniel Siebert explained his position and why he did not make a call. \u201cThere was contact, I can\u2019t deny that. But overall for me it wasn\u2019t a foul (on Kimmich). A bit of contact must be allowed in a Bundesliga top game. For me, there was no foul,\u201d Siebert said. As for why Dayot Upamecano escaped with a yellow card instead of a red card at a key moment in the second half, the referee also had an explanation for that as well. \u201cIf the foul had taken place centrally, directly in front of the penalty area, it would have been a different situation. If de Ligt wasn\u2019t in full sprint, it would be a different situation. I had the feeling that De Ligt was so close to the scene and wasn\u2019t outplayed. Therefore, no red card for Upamecano,\u201d Siebert said. I am just some dude typing this story, but I did not think it was a foul either. There was contact and it was surely borderline, but I just did not think it was enough to warrant a whistle. Navas to Al-Nassr? (@RudyGaletti) Linked to Bayern Munich just a few weeks ago, Paris Saint-Germain\u2019s Keylor Navas could be joining Cristiano Ronaldo at Al-Nassr: \u23f3 Keylor #Navas is very close to #AlNasr, after the initial agreement with the club based on a 6-month loan contract.

Yann Sommer officially transferred in, Konrad Laimer unofficially inks his deal (allegedly), and there is wall-to-wall excitement for the squad\u2019s re-start in the Bundesliga. Needless to say, we have A LOT on our minds about the biggest news pieces of the week. This is what we have on tap for this week\u2019s episode: Reacting to the Yann Sommer signing and the weird quirk of this deal that will be odd to watch play out. Konrad Laimer\u2019s signing isn\u2019t official, but it\u2019s done. New rumors on Tottenham Hotspur\u2019s Harry Kane and why it will be easier for Bayern Munich to get him rather than other Premier League squads. Should Bayern Munich fans get excited for Arijon Ibrahimovi\u0107? Assessing the Bundesliga title race. Some brief thoughts on the series premiere of The Last of Us. Chelsea, Gunners hunting Camavinga (90Min.com) Former Bayern Munich transfer target Eduardo Camavinga has not made quite the splash many expected at Real Madrid, but that has not stopped Chelsea FC and Arsenal FC from lobbing inquiries over to the player: Arsenal and Chelsea have both asked Real Madrid about the availability of Eduardo Camavinga this month, sources have told 90min. The Gunners and the Blues are both on the hunt for reinforcements in midfield before the end of the January transfer window - 90min reported on Friday about Chelsea\u2019s failed approaches for Franck Kessie, Yves Bissouma and Moises Caicedo already this week. Their respective searches have led them to Camavinga, who has found starts hard to come by in his two years with Los Blancos. However, sources close to Real Madrid insist that they want to keep him, while those close to Camavinga say he is not looking to leave and is happy at the club despite his limited game time. Leipzig wooing Reus? (Sky Sport) Could Borussia Dortmund be considering a move to RB Leipzig, as well as Manchester United? Sky Sport has started connected the dots: The future of Marco Reus - it is still completely open. So far there have been no negotiations with his club Borussia Dortmund about an extension, although his contract expires at the end of the season. The BVB captain arouses interest in other clubs. Also at RB Leipzig? Reus consultant Dirk Hebe was a guest in the Red Bull Arena on Friday evening in Leipzig at the start of the rest of the round against FC Bayern (1-1) . According to Sky information, he attended the game at the invitation of RB. What\u2019s going on between Reus and the Red Bulls? The fact is: Leipzig\u2019s new managing director Sport Max Eberl is one of the biggest sponsors in Reus\u2019 career. In 2009, when he was still sporting director of Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach, he brought Reus into the Bundesliga from second division club RW Ahlen for one million euros. Already there was lever on the side of Reus. His meteoric rise brought in 17 million euros for Gladbach in 2012, when the native of Dortmund switched to his heart club Borussia Dortmund thanks to an opt-out clause. Eberl recently hinted to the BILD newspaper that he still sees an interesting player in Reus, who could become an issue in Leipzig, especially because of his expiring contract: \u201cIn general, free transfer players have found a very large market If players are free transfers, then you should at least deal with each one.\u201d About the qualities of the offensive star, Eberl said: \u201cMarco is more of a leader who can make a squad stronger through his experience.\u201d Anything can between now and the summer transfer window, but this would be weird, eh? Bavarian Podcast Works: Postgame Show \u2014 RB Leipzig vs. Bayern Munich (Bavarian Football Works) Bayern Munich doesn\u2019t really have that many average days. Today, against RB Leipzig, was one of them. Considering how long the Bundesliga has been away for, the performance can be forgiven.

    "description": "Earlier this month, Michigan Supreme Court Justice Richard Bernstein spoke out against a fellow justice granting someone a second chance. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0",
    "content": "Who deserves a second chance? I think most people would answer, \u201cmost people.\u201d Last weekend, inside Nazarene Missionary Baptist Church in Detroit, a group of folks sat in a circle and put this theory to the test. Filling one chair was Michigan Supreme Court Justice Richard Bernstein. Filling the others were former prisoners of the criminal justice system and their advocates. Even the pastor had done time behind bars. The meeting was supposed to last an hour. It went on for nearly four. Now, we\u2019ll get to what happened in a moment. But let\u2019s be honest. When it comes to second chances, we Americans afford them all the time. Athletes who get in off-field trouble. Actors who misbehave. Media types who throw tantrums. Politicians exposed as liars. They get second chances, because we, the public, are the ones doing the forgiving. We\u2019re the ones continuing to watch, continuing to pay for tickets, continuing to vote. On the other hand, in smaller, less public places, private offices and local neighborhoods, people can be less forgiving. One strike and you\u2019re gone. So the question of second chances may be less about \u201cWho deserves one?\u201d than \u201cWho decides who deserves one?\u201d This is a stickier wicket. How quickly the tables have turned Recently, here in Michigan, we had a showdown on this issue. Bernstein, recently reelected to the state Supreme Court, expressed, in an interview, his disgust at the hiring of a former criminal named Pete Martel as a law clerk for fellow-Justice Kyra Harris Bolden. Martel, as a young man, had been involved in a convenience store robbery with some friends. In fleeing the police, he shot at a cruiser. No one was hurt. But Martel went to prison, then tried to escape. He spent 14 years behind bars, 10 of those in solitary confinement. When he got out, he began to rebuild his life. A formerly bad student, he studied, got his college degree and eventually graduated law school from Wayne State. He became an advocate for those still behind bars. He even worked in the State Appellate Defender Office. But Bernstein was unmoved. While believing in second chances, he said, he felt Martel did not deserve the prestigious law clerk position. \u201cThere are certain jobs you should never be allowed to have after you shoot at a police officer, and one of them is clerking for the highest court in the state,\" Bernstein told the Detroit News . Martel quickly resigned. So, at that moment, it seemed the person deciding on second chances was Bernstein. But the backlash against him was swift. Many who had voted for him said they felt betrayed. He was bashed in the media. He was criticized heavily by prisoner advocates and others. Days later, Bernstein apologized \u2014 to the public, to Bolden, and to Martel . He said he had overstepped, and that he wanted to be better in the future. Suddenly, he was the one seeking redemption. A different type of justice Darryl Woods knows a lot about that subject. He spent nearly 30 years in prison for a crime he maintains he did not commit. His sentence was overturned once, and he was ultimately granted commutation in 2019 by then-Gov. Rick Snyder. Instead of being bitter, Woods has devoted his life to breaking down the barriers and misconceptions about \u201creturning citizens,\u201d a better moniker than \u201cex-cons.\u201d He is, amongst other duties, the director of the Better Together program of SAY Detroit , which brings police officers and at-risk citizens together for meals and fellowship. Woods was one of the organizers of that meeting at Nazarene. Judge Bernstein sat in one chair. Folks like Woods surrounded him. How did it go? \u201cIt was a very tough conversation,\u201d Woods said. \u201cBut I'm telling you, by the end, there was not a dry eye in the room. \u201cWe had former (prisoners) who were now businesspeople, we had the pastor who had been in jail himself. We all told Justice Bernstein what it was like returning to society, and how what he said about Pete Martel sounded like it was OK for certain people in society to still be segregated. That they couldn\u2019t have certain jobs. It\u2019s already tough for people who return to society from prison to be able to do things like get housing. He was able to hear that. \u201cHe hung onto every word that everybody spoke. He sat there and took it. By the end, he was hugging people and weeping in their arms. He said he deeply regretted what had happened. He didn\u2019t mean it. He was deeply sorry.\u201d Hmm. Aren\u2019t those the words we often hear from criminals who finish their sentences? It's easy to judge others when you've never made a mistake. But once you do, you don't want to forever be judged by that one misstep. I understand those who push to severely punish repeat criminals. Some people do not seem rehabable. But shouldn't that make those who try even more worthy of a shot? I asked Woods whether he felt that Bernstein should be forgiven. \u201cAbsolutely. Everybody in that room believed in redemption. We all listened to him, especially at the end, when he said, \u2018I now know how it feels to want a second chance.' \u201d We like to think that we are all so different, that status, education or wealth separate us. But we can all switch positions so fast in this life. The saints become the sinners, the sinners become the forgivers. Woods said that he and Bernstein have met two more times since last Saturday, and they are developing a relationship that probably never would have started if not for this incident. Second chances work in strange ways. But we are all worthy of them, judges and returning citizens alike. Contact Mitch Albom: malbom@freepress.com .

All this aside from the obvious 4 Finals MVPs and 4 NBA championships. The King was always expected to be one of the better NBA players of this generation. However, his domination over the entire era can only be compared to Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant. However, this is not a discussion of what he has done over the course of his career. No, this a call back to a little fashionable moment he had right before he stepped into the spotlight of the NBA. A suit so clean, even the heavens quaked on that fine day in 2003.

And the outfits he sported in the YouTube clip below are a result of that. Nothing too flashy here. Just clean, fresh looks. However, it appears that wasn\u2019t the King\u2019s approach on June 26th, 2003. The day he was drafted. In one of the most stunning displays, James came out with a suit so clean, it hasn\u2019t been matched to this day. Undoubtedly a suit so clean, it\u2019d embarrass anyone\u2019s church shoes. Unfortunately, as pristine as it is, it was recently sullied. And it happened on the worst way possible. \u00a0 Someone else decides to put on LeBron James\u2019s suit during a House Party Or rather, the suit was sullied mercilessly during the movie \u2018House Party\u2019, starring LeBron James, and his house. Yes, his house. The story goes that he hired a cleaning service for his place. Due to it, our 2 main characters get access to James\u2019s house. As the movie goes on though, shenanigans take place. And ultimately it culminates in this hilarious moment.

    "content": "A movie originally designed to be watched in quick bursts on a mobile device, will now be getting a full-on theatrical release. Quibi's Die Hart is getting a limited theatrical release through Prime Video, making the latest twist in the Quibi saga -- one far too long or complicated to fit into a video on Quibi. The \"movie\" -- really a feature-length reworking of the series' original 10 episodes -- is directed by Weird: The Al Yankovic Story helmer Eric Appel, who since Brooklyn Nine-Nine has apparently fashioned himself a successful career in a weirdly (no pun intended) specific niche. John Wick franchise scribe Derek Kolstad created the series with Stuber writer Tripper Clancy. The total runtime of Die Hart is one hour, 18 minutes (unless there is something new added to the original series for the theatrical release). It will be dropping in theaters worldwide on February 24th in \"select cinemas,\" which could be either a limited release in New York and Los Angeles, or a Fathom Events-style screening where theaters around the country can opt-in for a limited release.In Die Hart, a fictionalized version of actor and comedian Kevin Hart is tired of being cast as a sidekick. He sets out to reinvent himself as an action star with the role of a lifetime, but things get real-life dangerous pretty quickly. The film also stars John Travolta, Nathalie Emmanuel, Jean Reno, and Josh Hartnett.Originally launched on Quibi in 2020, Die Hart was one of the projects picked up by Roku when it acquired Quibi's assets. Presently, Roku is in production on Die Hart 2: Die Harter, which will star John Cena, Ben Schwartz, and Paula Pell alongside a returning Hart.Quibi was the brainchild of former Disney and Dreamworks executive Jeffrey Katzenberg. The concept was fairly simple: it would try to capture the energy around TikTok or early YouTube, where all the content was short-form and taylored for personal devices...but it would do so using huge stars with bankable names. The company said their hope was to be the go-to entertainment platform for people riding on mass transit, waiting in lines, and other chores that create downtime in the middle of the day.{replyCount}commentsUnfortunately for them, their launch happened just as the Covid-19 pandemic shut down most of the world, and millions of people who might otherwise be bored on the subway, suddenly found themselves sitting around at home. Those circumstances, combined with the fact that a lot of observers and potential users never thought it was that good an idea to begin with, brought on a quick death for Quibi, which folded in December 2020 -- just 8 months after its programming had debuted in April.",

    "content": "Brazillian soccer legend Ronaldo Nazario once recalled how NBA legend Michael Jordan called him the MJ of the soccer world. Ronaldo Nazario has one of the saddest stories in football history. He started his career off in Brazil with Cruzeiro, for whom he knocked in 44 goals in 47 appearances as a teenager. This led to his selection to the Brazil national team for their World Cup win in 1994. Though he didn\u2019t appear in a single game at that tournament, Nazario\u2019s stock had risen quite significantly. Dutch football giants PSV Eindhoven picked him up as a 17-year-old for their roster. This is where Ronaldo made his first mark in European football. After 2 years of dominating the Eredivisie, Ronaldo earned a world record transfer to Spanish giants Barcelona. In his sole season with Barca, Ronaldo won them the La Liga trophy with a whopping 34-goal tally. Ronaldo Nazario turns 45 today.

But it was at Inter during his third season that Ronaldo suffered a debilitating knee injury. He rushed back to the field after a rather hasty recovery, which proved to be a bad decision as another knee injury kept him out of action for nearly 2 years. However, Ronaldo resurrected himself with a dominant performance for Brazil at the 2002 FIFA World Cup. He had 8 goals in 7 games to lead them to a 5th World Cup win. Nazario never returned to his former heights as a player, but he continued to play pro soccer until his retirement in 2011. Ronaldo Nazario recalls how MJ called him the \u2018Michael Jordan of soccer\u2019 Both Ronaldo and Michael Jordan endorsed sportswear giants Nike during their heyday. Ronaldo\u2019s peak with Barcelona coincided with the second threepeat won by Michael Jordan with the Bulls. In a 2021 interview with Marca, Ronaldo revealed a compliment that His Airness gave him when they met. This meeting took place at Nike\u2019s Beaverton headquarters in Oregon. \u201cHe said to me \u2018you are the Michael Jordan of soccer\u2019.

    "content": "LOGAN \u2014 Utah State men\u2019s basketball had a golden opportunity to make a critical defensive stop against the San Jose State Spartans down by a point with 2:57 remaining, and the Aggies pulled it off \u2014 again, and again, and again. And again. The Aggies overcame San Jose State nabbing four offensive rebounds and taking five shots on their second-to-last possession with nothing to show for it. Then junior guard Steven Ashworth, the shortest player on the court at the time, finally grabbed the defensive rebound, streaked downcourt and buried a go-ahead 3-pointer with 1:44 to go. Ultimately, Utah State came away with a 75-74 win over the Spartans on Saturday as junior Max Shulga made a tie-breaking free throw with 5.8 seconds remaining, the second game in a row that he\u2019s made critical free throws in the final minute after making two of them against UNLV last Tuesday. \u201cAll of us shoot free throws every day,\u201d Shulga said, \u201cso it\u2019s just a matter of staying composed and don\u2019t get too high when we go on a run or don\u2019t get too low when they go on a run, so it was just staying composed and staying level-headed.\u201d Ashworth led the team in scoring with 19 points, 16 of which came in the second half. Shulga was consistent through the game and finished with 15 points on 6 of 8 from the field, and senior forward Dan Akin added another 13 with seven rebounds. Shulga went to the line with the game tied and missed the first shot as a home crowd of 8,895 groaned. Against the wave of frustration after a game rife with frustrating moments, he calmly drained the second one, and the Aggies rushed back on defense to force a game-ending miss from 3 from SJSU guard Alvaro Cardenas. \u201cNaturally, you start thinking like, \u2018Oh my God, no way I just missed it,\u2019\u201d but you just try to dismiss those thoughts and trust your follow through, your shot and just stay in the moment,\u201d Shulga said. Most of the game wasn\u2019t favorable for the Aggies, as they trailed for over 31 minutes and by as much as 11 at one point in the first half. The most haunting part, one that would have reminded fans of the Aggies\u2019 non-conference loss to Weber State, was how the Spartans answered Utah State\u2019s scoring runs with big, momentum-killing shots over and over again. The Aggies made scoring runs that either got within a possession or retook the lead on four different occasions, all of them answered immediately by go-ahead buckets from San Jose State. \u201cWe had to adjust,\u201d Shulga said. \u201cAs the game goes on, we just have to adjust. We knew they were going to be really aggressive on the offensive board and try to be really physical with us. \u201cWe just had to adjust, see how the refs were calling, what were they calling, what were they not calling just as the game went on. I think we did a pretty good job of that in the second half.\u201d Utah State head coach Ryan Odom\u2019s game plan against the Spartans helped to limit their leading scorer, Omari Moore, who finished with 16 points on 8 of 19 from the field, but the Spartans\u2019 Tibet Gorener unexpectedly went off for 20 points on 7 of 11 shooting despite entering Saturday averaging just 5.6 points per game for the season. \u201cWe understood the shooting ability that this team has,\u201d Odom said. \u201cMoore can make shots. (Cardenas) can make shots. (Gorener) is a shooter. That\u2019s what he is.\u201d Coming into the last few possessions as the Aggies drew even with the Spartans, the crowd, from parents of youth cheer squads performing at halftime to a standing-room-only student section, and even the entire Sky View High School basketball team, rose to its feet, the same as it was in the last minute against UNLV earlier in the week. From the crowd\u2019s perspective, seeing the Spartans get five chances at the basket in a single possession was almost more than it could take. From Odom\u2019s, it was just how the game goes. \u201cThat was a huge play,\u201d Odom said. \u201cYou can get discouraged when you give up two or three offensive rebounds on one play. I felt like some of those were kind of a bad beat \u2026 I can\u2019t say enough about our crowd and the impact that our fans have on the game. \u201cIt\u2019s so loud in there, it\u2019s hard to think at times, and certainly I\u2019m sure it is for the opponent.\u201d",

To put it simply, Parma is the Wisconsin of Italian life, at least in the sense that cheese culture reigns supreme here. As one may have guessed, Parma is the proud home of Parmesan Reggiano. (The Reggiano portion of that moniker comes from the name of this region.) As a result, Parma and its surrounding communities serve as a minefield for the lactose-intolerant as the area is positively plastered with formaggio, including the shops that hawk cheese-wheels the size of Goodyear tires. At trattorias across this land, the cheese is rarely, if-ever, grated, but rather served via large chunks piled high on a plate, to be eaten by hand with the area\u2019s other specialties. Those include Parma ham or torta fritta, which are essentially salty, light puffs of fried dough. Yes, piles of cheese, as well as fatty and fried food. American catnip is on the menu here in Parma. Parmigiano-Reggiano, the cheese must pass inspections and meet specific quality standards. David Silverman/Getty Images ** But there is another beloved claim-to-fame of this community that is neither made up of salt nor fat. His name is Giuseppe and he was born and lived in these parts a century ago. What\u2019s ironic however is that I\u2019ve heard that Giuseppe Verdi was not so fond of quaint Parma, and certainly not as much as he enjoyed nearby big city life in Milan, where he\u2019d later trek in search of a career as a composer. It\u2019s a career that wound up materializing into what became a famously-lengthy run of creativity and world-famous operas. Throughout an 87 year-run, he was the mastermind behind such classics as Rigoletto , Il Trovatore , Aida and La Traviata. Yes, along with the aforementioned dairy, Guseieppe is Parma\u2019s favorite son, even though he did not return that sentiment. Still, Verdi\u2019s footprints are found all over Parma and its surrounding communities, with the late composer still conducting over this part of the world like a musical ghost. Sure, the composer Arturo Toscanini is also from these parts too, but his legacy is small potatoes compared to Mr. Verdi. (Also, Verdi never left Italy, while Toscanni decamped to New York for a time where he conducted in-house at NBC Radio). While top-of-mind year-round, Verdi\u2019s legacy truly takes center stage (or to tweak that figure of speech, steps squarely in the conductor\u2019s stand) every autumn. That\u2019s when Festival Verdi descends on the region; four weekends when the area welcomes a flood of visitors to feast their eyes and ears on his productions at Parma\u2019s opulent Teatro Reggio as well as Teatro Magnani, located in nearby Fidenza, along with street performances and talks. Many of the Americans who attend are rabid fans of the opera and regularly traverse the world in search of the art form. The New York-based non-profit International Friends of Festival Verdi serves as the pipeline from America to Parma for many of the attendees, and it\u2019s who I\u2019 tagged along with during this particular weekend. Admittedly, for someone with a formerly-rudimentary knowledge of opera (I was happily stoned when I saw my first and only opera at New York\u2019s Met, during which I was angrily hushed by the man next to me), it has been an education. Luckily, Francesco Izzo is here to fill in my gaps. A part-time resident of Parma and a Professor of Music at the University of Southampton in England, Izzo is \u201cDirettore Scientifico\u201d of Festival Verdi Parma. In other words, he\u2019s one of the keepers of Verdi\u2019s legacy. Case in point, Izzo tells me with passion in his voice: \u201cVerdi in Parma is a responsibility; not a right or privilege. It is a challenge and must remain a challenge.\u201d Suffice to say, this is a man who takes his Verdi seriously. Verdi Monument in front of Rocca Pallavicino with Opera House Teatro in Busseto. Getty Images *** It\u2019s Saturday afternoon in rural Roncole, located about 30 minutes from Parma proper. Still full from yesterday\u2019s platefulls of, you guessed it, cheese and ham, and I\u2019m walking through Casa Natale Verdi Museum, Verdi\u2019s childhood home. Today, magnets of cheese wheels that say \u201cParma\u201d are sold in the gift shop as an Italian flag waves outside in the country breeze. It\u2019s plain to see that Gusieppe decidedly did not come to age with a silver spoon in his mouth, but grew up in rather modest means here as the son of both an innkeeper and that long-ago full-time career known as a \u201cspinner.\u201d True to Italian form, there seems to be two dining rooms here: a small one and another that\u2019s, well, bigger. A wooden table displays a place setting where the Verdi\u2019s would have gathered around, complete with a bottle of Chianti and its distinctive wicker base, along with a loaf of bread. The floors here are lined with brick and the ceilings are outfitted with long wood beams, its imperfections distinctly convey a handmade quality. Verdi spent his early years here which were marked by tragedy in the form of the death of his younger sister, Giuseppa, who was also his best friend. In fact, his later years were marked by a similar loss with the deaths of his only two children by blood, as well as his first wife; the latter of a brain inflammation with the terrifying name of Encephalitis. It\u2019s no wonder why the operas I see during my trip are so angry with emotion, depicting extreme heartbreak and loss, with scenes ricocheting between pure jubilance and the depths of despair. While perhaps his most famous production, Il Trovatore, portrays characters exploding with an extreme joy, it ends with the two main lovers in a dungeon, both dying in utter agony. The house in the small village of Roncole Verdi (Busseto, Parma, Italy) where Giuseppe Verdi was born on October 10th, 1813, which is now a museum owned by the City of Busseto. August, 29, 2012. Edoardo Fornaciari/Getty Images ** The home Verdi wound up making for himself is much more expansive than his humble childhood digs. It\u2019s called Villa Verdi, because when one is both famous and rich your home has a moniker that is equally as ostentatious as it is eponymous. Located in the village of Sant'Agata, the property has been virtually left untouched from his 1901 death, complete with his books, curtains and sheets, right down to his distinct black hat sitting idly by, unworn for the past 120 years. It\u2019s a sprawling property complete with horse stable, wine room, and ornately decorated bedrooms complete with floral wallpaper which has long lost its bright color. The man had a dedication to his craft which would be inspiring if it didn\u2019t border on eccentricity, including sleeping in a separate bedroom from his wife in order, we\u2019re told, to not wake her when late-night inspiration struck. Elsewhere, it\u2019s been said that he purposely covered his walking path around the property with sand, because gravel would have drowned out his musical thoughts while on a stroll through nature. After walking through his dusty bedrooms, I ask Izzo later about the basis of the festival itself. \u201cIn some ways, Festival Verdi has no reason to exist; it is utterly indispensable \u201d he says during a moment of candidness. Izzo is fully aware that we\u2019re not talking about a ubiquitous household name like Beethoven or Shakespeare, but rather someone who the majority of lay people have never heard of. \u201cThe Festival can only exist when there\u2019s still so much to learn about him, and there is, both in terms of performing his lesser-known works and also performing them in a way that\u2019s closer to the spirit of the intention of Verdi himself.\u201d For the team behind the festival, that also amounts to a sense of risk. Word to the wise: do not piss off opera diehards because they will retaliate. At a performance of Verdi\u2019s Simon Boccanegera at the Teatro Reggio, some members of the (presumably vegan) audience booed at a new addition for the century-old show: the production's depiction of a butcher shop. Castello di Torrechiara on hill at sunrise, Parma, Italy. Getty Images ** Back inside Villa Verdi, the tour guide breaks a bit of news that elicited gasps from the gathered group: after a century of private ownership, the home and property are closing to the public, perhaps for good, this fall. Filling me in on the backstory, Izzo explains Villa Verdi is for sale and only God knows if someone will buy it. Verdi\u2019s distant family members don\u2019t have the financial means to keep the place open. While Villa Verdi may revert to the Italian government, it\u2019s an open question if they, too, would have the financial means for upkeep and public visitation. (It being the Italian government and all). Then again, unlike in America, it\u2019s not like they\u2019re going to knock it down and build a Citibank. \u201cAccording to Italian law, it needs to be preserved exactly the way Verdi left it,\u201d Izzo explains. \u201cSo we hope they can find a motivated buyer who can step in, like an institute or university who may want to have cultural activities there.\u201d Still, he adds with a wince: \u201cFor the moment, we\u2019re at a stage where we don\u2019t know what will happen. Which is scary. I prefer not to think about it.\u201d A recent glimmer of hope came this past November when Gennaro Sangiuliano, Italy\u2019s Minister of Culture walked through the house and assured the press there were \u201cmany entrepreneurs willing to intervene,\u201d adding \u201cthe government is very attentive to the fate of this villa, of this museum, because Verdi is the foundation of our nation, he is a heritage of all Italians.\u201d Whatever happens to the Villa, I feel fortunate to perhaps be among the very last people in a legacy of multiple generations to see it. Regardless of what goes down, the Villa\u2019s unsure future lends validity to both Parma and Festival Verdi\u2019s obsession with keeping the man alive. It\u2019s a mission that battles against the ending of memories, lives and real estate alike; even if Verdi himself wasn\u2019t a fan of Parma as much as Parma currently loves him. Izzo notably tells me that this Italian pride in Verdi came to fruition in the early 1900s. \u201cThere was a widespread quest for symbols of Italian role models and many cities began to celebrate and glorify and take pride in some of their most illustrious citizens,\u201d he explains. \u201cFor Parma that\u2019s Verdi. Every Italian city has a Verdi Street, Piazza Verdi, Ristorante Verdi, Pizzeria Verdi, and so on and so forth. But Parma does it to a much greater extent.\u201d \u201cWhen my mother decided to relocate to Parma she moved to what was called the Verdi building,\u201d he adds. \u201cVerdi himself would have strongly objected to this.\u201d",

    "content": "Rising to the challenge of equaling the batshit wildness of his prior Possessor , Brandon Cronenberg writhes around in more psychosexual body-horror violation, mutation, mutilation, and hysteria with Infinity Pool , a film so extreme that the only reasonable response is often laughter. Cronenberg\u2019s third feature is many things all at once, and though it doesn\u2019t all cohere in neat-and-tidy fashion, that messiness is part of the point\u2014a notion repeatedly hammered home by up-close-and-personal sights of blood and body fluids dripping, gushing, and squirting out of various orifices and wounds. Not for the faint of heart but precisely the sort of nightmare that fans of Cronenberg (and his father David) crave, Infinity Pool is an ideal fit for the Sundance Film Festival \u2019s Midnight section, where it just premiered ahead of its Jan. 27 theatrical release. The film oozes menace even before its chaos begins, courtesy of ominous snapshots of the vast ocean and white, angular trellises covering the walkways of a swanky resort on the fictional island of Li Tolqa. It\u2019s here that Em (Cleopatra Coleman) and James Foster ( Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd ) are vacationing, seemingly so that the latter might finally find the inspiration to follow up the one novel he wrote\u2014to negative reviews\u2014six years ago. Theirs is a relationship that feels as if it\u2019s quietly fraying beyond repair, and thus when James meets Gabby ( Mia Got h) and she introduces herself as a fan, he can\u2019t help but be flattered and enchanted. Photo by Frazer Harrison/Getty Images James and Em subsequently have dinner with Gabby and her husband Alban (Jalil Lespert) during which they learn that he\u2019s an architect and she\u2019s an actress who specializes in TV commercials\u2014specifically, those that require her to \u201cfail\u201d as a way of highlighting a product\u2019s necessity. That\u2019s weird, and Infinity Pool gets far weirder once Gabby and Alban convince James and Em to join them the following day on an excursion to a remote beach picnic spot. This is forbidden by the resort, and the fact that the gate through which they exit features enormous rings of barbed wire suggests that the island\u2019s dangerousness isn\u2019t a myth. A more intimate sort of peril, however, materializes once they reach their destination and, while relieving himself in private, James is manhandled by Gabby, who jerks him to completion (in one of many graphic, torrential close-ups) with blank-eyed mechanicalness. (Warning: Some spoilers follow.) If James is shaken by this sudden encounter, he\u2019s thoroughly rattled when, driving home that night, the car\u2019s headlights go out and he accidentally strikes and kills a local farmer. Convinced to flee the scene rather than take his chances with the island\u2019s ghastly legal system, James and Em return to the resort. Unfortunately, the police come knocking, taking the couple past a network of rusty, winding industrial pipes (the flipside of the earlier trellises) and to a derelict police station. There, detective Thresh (Thomas Kretschmann) explains the truly bonkers predicament in which James has landed. On the island, those guilty of murder are executed by the victim\u2019s family members\u2014in this case, the farmer\u2019s young son. Yet due to a diplomatic arrangement, perpetrators can pay to have themselves cloned so that their copy, who retains all their memories, can be put to death in their place. Don\u2019t bother asking how this island has perfected such a technique, or even how the process works. James signs on the dotted line, hands over a wad of cash (from an ATM inside the police station!), strips down and, after being measured, steps into a shower with a floor full of red-blue goo, where he\u2019s engulfed in strobe lights and battered with images of disco balls, nude women, and reflections of himself. Afterwards, he and Em are forced to watch the boy repeatedly and viciously stab James\u2019 doppelganger. Crazier still, upon returning to their hotel, James\u2014whose passport is now mysteriously missing\u2014is invited to join Gabby, Alban, and some of their friends, who reveal that they too have all undergone this procedure. Corey Nickols/Getty Images for IMDb James has stumbled into a group of deranged thrill-seekers who view this surrogate-spawning process as a license to indulge their every deviant desire\u2014since, after all, they can just pay to have themselves duplicated in order to escape capital punishment. That\u2019s just the tip of Infinity Pool \u2019s irrational iceberg, with James thrust into a hedonistic vortex of robbery, murder, hallucinatory drugs, orgiastic sex, and local ceremonial masks that resemble fiendishly disfigured faces. Whether James is himself or his replica is merely the first of many unnerving questions raised by this scenario, as the writer/director turns the film into a swirling, sinister vision of insecurity and strength, self-destruction and rebirth, transformation and desecration, and\u2014during much of its second half\u2014wealthy tourist privilege run madly amok. Cronenberg dives off the deep end and keeps descending into darker and more malevolent waters, bombarding viewers with schizoid montages of hazy forms, brilliant colors, merging body parts (including copious genitalia), and dripping blood. Close-ups of eyes, necks, and hands are rampant, lending the action a tactile quality that\u2019s as potent as the throbbing malice of Tim Hecker\u2019s electronic score. The proceedings feel both clinically manicured and soiled, not to mention unhinged. To that end, Goth\u2014fresh off her extraordinary turn in Pearl \u2014proves an entrancing figure of entitled, cunning perversion. Sultry and nurturing, sweet and cruel, she\u2019s the engine that powers this malignant affair as it plummets into an abyss of guises and deceptions, twisted parent-child tensions, and unholy unions. Like all great horror directors, Cronenberg cares less about making lucid thematic or socio-political arguments than about splattering his fears, anxieties, and hang-ups onto the screen, where they can meet, intertwine, and tear apart at a moment\u2019s notice. Infinity Pool has plenty to say but no eagerness to hold its audience\u2019s hand; its prime motivation is to shock, confound, and overwhelm, and the writer/director once again finds a way to keep escalating the madness until, finally, it becomes outright hilarious. That Skarsg\u00e5rd is so game for this sort of left-field lunacy\u2014in which he suffers a barrage of manipulation, abuse, and humiliation\u2014confirms that he\u2019s one of Hollywood\u2019s most daring leading men, as interested in eviscerating idealized masculinity as he is in embodying it. As for Cronenberg, he\u2019s a crazed genius of Frankensteinian symbiosis and division, smashing together disparate elements to create beautifully misshapen monsters.

    "content": "close Video Don Lemon presses Chuck Schumer on Biden classified documents The 'CNN This Morning' host asked Schumer why he had a more 'measured' reaction to Biden as opposed to Trump. The Senate Judiciary Committee will reconsider several of President Biden 's judicial nominees that Ted Cruz, R-Texas., said last year were \" extremists, partisans and radicals \" when they were nominated in the last Congress but failed to move. The Senate will convene this week for the legislative work of the 118th Congress, and the Democrats' slim 51-49 majority is expected to make it much easier to confirm Biden's nominees than it was last year in the 50-50 Senate. In the last Congress, Republicans protested eight of these nominees by citing their records of approving lenient sentences for violent criminals and supporting left-wing causes. Dale Ho has been renominated to be a judge on New York's Southern District Court, and in a hearing last year, Cruz said Biden has \"made a pattern of nominating extremists, partisans and radicals\" for administrative and judicial positions. Cruz said Ho's record \"reflects that same pattern of finding someone who has been an extreme partisan\" and \"a radical.\" Cruz pointed out that Ho, who has worked for the ACLU and NAACP, had \"tweeted attacks\" at multiple members of the Senate Judiciary Committee and that \"far from being intemperate statements when you were a teenager, most of these tweets occurred last year.\" DICK DURBIN DRAGGED FOR CLAIMING FREE SPEECH 'DOES NOT INCLUDE SPREADING MISINFORMATION': 'IT LITERALLY DOES' Sen. Dick Durbin will chair the Senate Judiciary Committee in the 118th Congress. (Ting Shen/Bloomberg via Getty Images) \"So in the last 12 months, you have engaged \u2013 or the last about 18 months \u2013 you have engaged in partisan attacks on multiple members of this committee,\" Cruz said before touching on a 2017 tweet from Ho: \"In these dark times, I\u2019ve been fortunate to find tremendous sense of purpose in my work as a civil rights lawyer. But as a colleague of mine asked me over lunch recently, 'Dale, do you do this because you want to help people or because you hate conservatives?\u2019\" Cruz said, quoting Ho. \"What he was getting at is that anger can in fact, be a tremendous source of power. For me, righteous indignation can provide a sense of moral clarity and motivate the long hours needed to get the work done. But it\u2019s only a short-term burst. It\u2019s not sustaining in the long run.\" The senator asked Ho how his previous comments would assure a conservative in his courtroom of his impartiality as a judge. Ho defended his comments by saying they were from a \"church\" conversation. Another nominee that took heat from Republicans last year and was renominated is Rachel Bloomekatz, an Ohio public interest lawyer who was nominated last year to serve on the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals. Last August, Bloomekatz faced brutal questioning from Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., for her defense of a 15-year-old, Brandon Moore, who beat and participated in the gang rape of a pregnant college student at gunpoint. Moore was sentenced to 141 years in prison, and a trial court ruled that he \"could not be rehabilitated.\" Bloomekatz argued all the way up to the Ohio Supreme Court that Moore should be released early, after claiming that his sentence was a violation of the Eighth Amendment against cruel and unusual punishment. In her hearing, Bloomekatz defended her position by saying U.S. Supreme Court precedent holds that minors should be treated differently in sentencing than adults, which Hawley said he found \"hard to understand.\" \"He's a criminal. He was 15 years old at the time he committed his horrific crimes, and what he took away from that young woman, she'll never get back,\" Hawley said. Another nominee, Nusrat Jahan Choudhury, nominated to serve on a New York District Court, has spent the better part of her career as a high-ranking lawyer at the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and once claimed that police kill unarmed Black men every day. SENATE FAILS TO CONFIRM BIDEN NOMINEE WHO ONCE RELEASED MAN LATER INVOLVED IN MURDER OF 10-YEAR-OLD President Joe Biden has renominated lawyers and judges with troubling backgrounds on crime. (Andrew Caballero) When Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., questioned Choudury on the matter in her hearing last year, she said she made the statement to make a \"rhetorical point\" during her work as an advocate. Despite these GOP complaints, Democrats believe they will have the upper hand on nominations this year given the 51-49 split. When Democrats cinched the majority last year, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer , D-N.Y., said confirming judges to the bench would be a \"a lot easier\" in a 51-seat majority. \"The practical effects of the 51-seat majority, it's big. It's significant. It gives us a bridge. We can breathe a sigh of relief,\" Schumer said in a November 2022 press conference.

It's one of the most significant things, maybe the most even of things we've done,\" Schumer said. \"It's been amazing how Republicans have been able to use the 50-50 Senate to procedurally hold up so many appointments. It's going to be a lot quicker, swifter and easier,\" Schumer added.

President Biden's tenure in the White House has been marked with a consistent tone surrounding the Second Amendment and firearms, but on several occasions, the president has shown that he may not know the real issue at hand as he repeatedly pushes for a ban on \"assault weapons.\" Biden's latest remarks taking aim at strong supporters of the Second Amendment and certain firearms came last week during a speech at the National Action Network's annual Martin Luther King Jr. breakfast in Washington, where he appeared to mock his conservative colleagues. \"I love my right-wing friends who talk about the tree of liberty is water of the blood of patriots,\" he said. \"If you need to work about taking on the federal government, you need some F-15s. You don't need an AR-15.\" The quote Biden refers to dates back to Thomas Jefferson , who wrote in a letter, \"The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots & tyrants.\" Jefferson was the principal author of the Declaration of Independence and America's third president. BIDEN BLASTED FOR REPEATING DEBUNKED GUN CLAIMS AT MLK JR. DAY SPEECH: 'OLE' SHOOT 'EM IN THE LEG IS BACK' President Biden's tenure in the White House has been marked by a consistent tone surrounding the Second Amendment and firearms in America. (Kevin Dietsch, Michael Macor/The San Francisco Chronicle via Getty Images) Biden has previously said gun-rights advocates need a much bigger arsenal of weapons to take on the federal government. In July 2021, he said: \"You need to have weapons to take on the government, you need F-15s and maybe some nuclear weapons\" during a White House speech to outline his plan to combat gun violence. In the same speech, he also falsely claimed there have always been limits on the Second Amendment. \"The Second Amendment, from the day it was passed, limited the type of people who could own a gun and what type of weapon you could own. You couldn't buy a cannon,\" he said. \"The point is that there has always been the ability to limit \u2013 rationally limit \u2013 the type of weapon that can be owned and who can own it.\" These claims have been analyzed and found to be false when Biden has made them repeatedly over the past few years. Federal gun regulation didn\u2019t come until 1934, decades after the Second Amendment was introduced, according to Politifact . Last November, following the 2022 midterm elections, Biden said the \"idea we still allow semi-automatic weapons to be purchased is sick\" and insisted that the purchasing of certain firearms \"has no socially redeeming value.\" AR-15 rounds displayed at the offices of Scott Jackson, owner of Bay Area Firearms Instruction in Burlingame, California, on Sept. 22, 2016. (Michael Macor/The San Francisco Chronicle via Getty Images) Semi-automatic guns, including handguns and rifles, fire one bullet for each pull of the trigger. Last August, during a campaign-style event in Pennsylvania , Biden also offered a variety of gun-related gaffes to promote his \"Safer America\" agenda, which is focused on deterring crime, helping law enforcement, and toughening up gun laws while expanding background checks. During the speech, Biden made a claim about the speed of AR-15 bullets. \"Do you realize the bullet out of an AR-15 travels five times as rapidly as a bullet shot out of any other gun?\" Biden asked rhetorically during his speech. PRESIDENT BIDEN BOTCHES AR-15 FACTS WHILE STUMPING AGAINST GUN VIOLENCE IN PENNSYLVANIA It is unclear what the president was referencing, but AR-15s generally do not shoot the fastest bullets. President Biden speaks at Wilkes University in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, on Aug. 30, 2022. (Jim Watson/AFP via Getty Images) A June study by hunting gear retailer Field and Stream looked at the fastest rifle cartridges \u2013 and AR-15 rounds did not make their list. Field & Stream listed .220 Swift, .257 Weatherby Magnum and .30/378 Weatherby as the fastest rounds, along with 224 Clark and .22 Eargesplitten Loudenboomer. The .220 Swift, according to Outdoor Life magazine, is known as the \"fastest commercial rifle cartridge\" in the world and releases a 48-grain bullet at 4,100 feet per second. The .220 is not listed by the National Rifle Association (NRA) on its practical list as one of the cartridges that could be used in an AR-15. The .223 and 5.56 \u2013 two popular, high-speed AR-15 rounds \u2013 move around 2,700 to 3,100 feet per second. During the same Pennsylvania speech, in which Biden ridiculed Second Amendment supporters and sarcastically called them \"brave\" for believing guns are a tool for self-defense, Biden also claimed that \"AR-15s just rip the body apart,\" which is also inaccurate. Damage from a gunshot depends on the type of bullets used. \"For those brave right-wing Americans who say it\u2019s all about keeping America independent and safe, if you want to fight against the country, you need an F-15,\" Biden said mockingly at the time. \"You need something more than a gun.\" Biden's remarks related to certain firearms, as well as the right Americans have to own them, are not confined only to his presidency, however. Before taking office \u2013 during a campaign stop in Iowa in September 2019 \u2013 Biden said it is \"absolutely mindless\" that \"we don\u2019t have elimination of assault-type weapons and magazines that can hold multiple bullets in them.\" AR-15 rifles are displayed for sale at the Guntoberfest gun show in Oaks, Pennsylvania, Oct. 6, 2017. (Reuters/Joshua Roberts) Biden's remarks at the time seemingly dismissed the fact that a majority of modern-day firearms have magazines that hold more than one bullet in them, including the AR-15, which holds 30 rounds in a standard magazine. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Since taking office, Biden has urged Congress to pass measures related to gun control. Last June, after it was passed by both the Democrat-controlled House and Senate, Biden signed into law the most significant gun control bill in nearly 30 years. Spearheaded by Sens. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., and John Cornyn, R-Texas, the measure came in the wake of recent mass shootings at the time and provides funding for states to create programs, often called red flag laws, that could keep weapons away from people who are a danger to themselves or others. In addition, the measure enhances background checks for gun buyers under 21, adds penalties for some gun criminals and provides funding for a variety of health and mental health-related programs. It also addresses closing the so-called \"boyfriend loophole,\" which is a gap in federal law that means spousal domestic abusers can have gun rights taken away but not unmarried ones.

Is Kevin Costner responsible for TV's \"Yellowstone Effect?\" Some of the hottest shows on television right now feature tough-talking, macho movie stars who have been on Hollywood's A-list for decades. Sylvester Stallone, Jeff Bridges and Harrison Ford have all made the switch from the big screen to star in a television series. Stallone took on the role of a mob boss in \"Tulsa King,\" which was released in November. The \"Rocky\" star was a guest on \"Fox & Friends,\" where he explained that he'd always wanted to portray a gangster, but was constantly denied the roles because he \"didn\u2019t look Italian enough.\" And Harrison Ford is following Costner\u2019s path, riding horses through the Old West as Jacob Dutton on Taylor Sheridan's \"Yellowstone\" prequel, \"1923.\" WATCH KEVIN COSTNER CLASSICS ON FOX NATION Kevin Costner, Harrison Ford and Sylvester Stallone are among the Hollywood legends making television debuts. (Getty Images) Dave Quast, the senior vice president of Red Banyan, spoke to Fox News Digital about what could have enticed the movie stars to make the switch to the small screen, and why they have been so successful. \"Traditionally movies have been considered more prestigious than television to many actors, but the emergence of premium, cinematic streaming programming has shattered that distinction and Hollywood legends have taken note,\" Quast shared. He continued: \"While there may be a particular attraction to some of the uniquely American themes of rugged individualism, western machismo and nostalgia, it is most likely that the success of \u2018Yellowstone\u2019 inspired projects with similar themes.\" Here is a look at some old-school members of Hollywood\u2019s elite who have made the switch. Kevin Costner \u2013 'Yellowstone' Kevin Costner made his debut as John Dutton on \"Yellowstone\" in 2018.

Harrison Ford made his television debut in \"1923.\" (AP) \"1923\" is the second spinoff from the popular series, which follows the lives of the Dutton family as they run the Yellowstone Dutton Ranch.

Also in the hunt are longplays by 1300, Body Type, Camp Cope, Laura Jean and Party Dozen. The ultimate winner will be revealed March 1 in Sydney, when the champ will be presented with a A$30,000 ($21,000) bounty, courtesy of major sponsor Soundmerch. Sales and chart positions have no bearing on the result. It\u2019s the artistry of the entry that counts. \u201cYet again we have a very strong list,\u201d comments AMP founder and prize director Scott B. Murphy. \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly diverse and truly captures another year of the world\u2019s best music. I sincerely thank the Soundmerch AMP team of judges \u2013 their donation of time and passion is much greater than what most people would think.\u201d Sampa The Great has form with the AMP. The Zambian-born, Botswana-raised, Melbourne-based hip-hop artist bagged the prestigious prize in 2017 for the mixtape Birds And The BEE9, and again in 2020 with The Return, to become the first and only artist to win the prestigious award twice. Sampa had another world-first in 2020, when she was named as the first-ever BET Amplified global artist. The AMP is modeled on Britain\u2019s Mercury Music Prize and Canada\u2019s Polaris Prize, the goal of which is to identify and reward the outstanding creative Australian album of the past year. The nine shortlisted recordings are drawn from a longlist of 490 eligible Australian albums released in 2022, all of which were individually reviewed by a panel of music experts. This year, the domestic affiliates of EMI, Virgin and Island are on board to sponsor the shortlist by each contributing A$3,000 ($2,100) for a funding pool, which shortlisted artists can drawn on to ensure they can attend the winner announcement event. Genesis Owusu\u2019s lauded collection Smiling With No Teeth won the prize last time, beating out recordings by Nick Cave, Hiatus Kaiyote and others.

    "description": "by Sophia Kovatch ProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they\u2019re published. Under the Free File agreement, Americans who make less than $73,000 per year should be able to file their taxes for free with one of the tax preparation companies that partners with the IRS. But this program has been historically underutilized, with just 4% of eligible Americans filing for free in 2021. The story of the Free File program is long and twisting, and it can seem more like a fight against free tax filing than a fight for it. One of the biggest players is Intuit, the maker of TurboTax, one of the largest tax preparation software companies in the country. ProPublica has reported on Intuit and the Free File program since 2013. Here\u2019s what we\u2019ve found. The Truth About TurboTax In 2002, Intuit, H&R Block and other tax prep companies signed a deal with the IRS to provide free tax filing services to millions of Americans. In return, the IRS agreed it would not create its own tax filing system that could compete with the tax prep companies. A government-run tax filing system, often known as return-free filing, is already a reality in many countries around the world. With a return-free filing system, the government fills out the tax forms with the information it already has, and taxpayers simply have to review the forms for accuracy. This is not the case in the U.S. Switching to such a system would devastate tax prep company profits. That\u2019s why Intuit and other members of the industry spent millions through the years lobbying to preserve the Free File agreement, particularly the part that restricts the IRS from creating its own free filing system. That\u2019s not all Intuit did to limit the scope of Free File. Intuit purposefully suppressed its own Free File product. It added website code to block its Free File page from showing up in search engines and used manipulative marketing patterns to trick customers into paying for TurboTax even when they qualified for Free File. It later removed the code. Internal documents previously obtained by ProPublica show these strategies were intentional on the part of Intuit and H&R Block. In previous statements, Intuit and H&R Block maintained that they support and encourage free tax filing options through Free File and other avenues within their businesses. ProPublica\u2019s Reporting Impact As ProPublica reported on Intuit and the Free File program, government officials took note. When ProPublica pointed out that codifying the existing Free File agreement into law would permanently bar the IRS from creating its own free filing system, the bill got new scrutiny in Congress and the restriction on an IRS-created filing system was scrapped. Senior IRS leadership and a New York state regulator began investigating Intuit and the Free File program. The Federal Trade Commission started investigating Intuit too, looking into the company\u2019s allegedly deceptive marketing practices. Ultimately, Intuit was found to have tricked millions of Americans into paying to file their taxes when they should have been able to do so for free. The company reached a $141 million dollar settlement in May 2022 in a case led by New York Attorney General Letitia James and covering all 50 states and the District of Columbia. (Intuit did not admit any wrongdoing in the settlement.) More than 4 million people are expected to receive money as part of the settlement. It\u2019s not clear when the payments will be made. The Current State of Free File Following ProPublica\u2019s reporting in 2019, the IRS reformed the Free File program. It barred companies from using deceptive practices to deter taxpayers from using Free File and removed the prohibition on the IRS creating its own tax filing system. Intuit left the Free File program in October 2021, citing a desire to innovate beyond what the agreement would allow. In March 2022, during the first tax season in which TurboTax did not participate in the Free File program, the FTC sued Intuit over deceptive ads for its so-called \u201cFree\u201d edition. Intuit disputed the FTC\u2019s arguments but agreed to pull the ads in question for the remainder of tax season. After both Intuit and H&R Block left the Free File program, the future of the program was unclear. It\u2019s still difficult to find truly free tax filing options. The IRS created a tool to help you find this year\u2019s Free File options. More changes may be on the horizon for Free File. In August 2022, IRS received a mandate to look into creating a public filing system, with $15 million allocated to the study. Justin Elliot and Paul Kiel contributed reporting.",

In previous statements, Intuit and H&R Block maintained that they support and encourage free tax filing options through Free File and other avenues within their businesses. ProPublica\u2019s Reporting Impact As ProPublica reported on Intuit and the Free File program, government officials took note. When ProPublica pointed out that codifying the existing Free File agreement into law would permanently bar the IRS from creating its own free filing system, the bill got new scrutiny in Congress and the restriction on an IRS-created filing system was scrapped . Senior IRS leadership and a New York state regulator began investigating Intuit and the Free File program. The Federal Trade Commission started investigating Intuit too, looking into the company\u2019s allegedly deceptive marketing practices. Ultimately, Intuit was found to have tricked millions of Americans into paying to file their taxes when they should have been able to do so for free. The company reached a $141 million dollar settlement in May 2022 in a case led by New York Attorney General Letitia James and covering all 50 states and the District of Columbia. ( Intuit did not admit any wrongdoing in the settlement.) More than 4 million people are expected to receive money as part of the settlement. It\u2019s not clear when the payments will be made. The Current State of Free File Following ProPublica\u2019s reporting in 2019, the IRS reformed the Free File program . It barred companies from using deceptive practices to deter taxpayers from using Free File and removed the prohibition on the IRS creating its own tax filing system. ProPublica Read More Are Unemployment Benefits Taxed? Intuit left the Free File program in October 2021, citing a desire to innovate beyond what the agreement would allow. In March 2022, during the first tax season in which TurboTax did not participate in the Free File program, the FTC sued Intuit over deceptive ads for its so-called \u201cFree\u201d edition. Intuit disputed the FTC\u2019s arguments but agreed to pull the ads in question for the remainder of tax season. After both Intuit and H&R Block left the Free File program, the future of the program was unclear. It\u2019s still difficult to find truly free tax filing options. The IRS created a tool to help you find this year\u2019s Free File options . More changes may be on the horizon for Free File. In August 2022, IRS received a mandate to look into creating a public filing system , with $15 million allocated to the study. Justin Elliot and Paul Kiel contributed reporting.",

    "content": "Crypto KYC has become far more commonplace in 2023. This is due to crypto companies becoming an increasingly significant element of the financial system, terms like BTC, ETH, of NFTs have also become broadly known across the world. Virtual asset service providers (VASPs for short) have played a crucial role in crypto\u2019s growth and as crypto exchanges, and crypto wallets sprout so do new ways to use virtual assets illegally. Money launderers are known for how quickly they can adapt themselves to new paradigms in finance, and within crypto, it is in no way different. Sophisticated new ways of using virtual assets have prompted governments throughout the world to attempt to bring virtual asset service providers under AML regulations (anti-money laundering). Subsequently, in virtue of said regulations, having (KYC) procedures became mandatory. KYC data refers to the data collected from Virtual Asset Service Providers throughout their onboarding and transactions which verifies client identity. This due diligence happens on account of process compliance with the regulatory framework at hand, namely with what concerns Customer Due Diligence (CDD). KYC intended purposes are simple: to identify clients and perform a verification check before granting them access to a service or to conduct a transaction. Has crypto regulation can drastically differ from one jurisdiction to another, it is important to understand that clients will also be required to submit different types of data. Usually, the absolute minimum KYC data gathered is a client\u2019s full name, his or her date of birth, and their residential address. The data is crosschecked with government-issued documents which the client must also submit. There are different stages in a KYC onboarding process, depending obviously on which company is performing it and the jurisdiction in which it operates. Generally speaking, onboarding starts with the identification stage in which the client submits his or her personal data. Usually, the client is asked to take a photo of their government-issued document and submit it. The said document is checked for issues, mistakes, and so forth as a way to attest to its authenticity. The data on the document in question is crosschecked with user-submitted data as well. Depending on the client\u2019s address, it will be determined if he or she is currently located in a high-risk country. Finally, there is usually a liveness check in which the user needs to prove his or her actual presence and a risk scoring stage in which the client is assessed with a risk category on the basis of the whole evaluation. In essence, KYC procedures can be either manual and/or automated. Both options have their pros and cons. Manual checks are much slower than automated ones. They are also costlier, and slightly more error-prone as human involvement leads to higher error rates. As for automated KYC processes, they are known for bringing costs down while speeding up onboarding. The process is designed to extract data from the documents users provide and compare the said data and documents to templates. A KYC check is usually mandatory in most jurisdictions. Thus, users aren\u2019t allowed to buy crypto or withdraw their funds before completing and passing a KYC check. But, even with legal obligations aside, being KYC compliant is incredibly helpful to crypto companies in many ways as the transparency it provides prevents money laundering and financing terrorism, helps in the fight against fraud, and boosts overall trust in both clients and investors. Non-KYC exchanges are normally unregulated and decentralized. They usually sprout in countries in which AML regulation is lacking (or almost non-existent). There are several risks of using non-KYC platforms, but the main one is the heightened vulnerability that clients have to criminals. Crypto\u2019s very nature lies in its inherent decentralization. It seems fairly certain that embracing KYC is in the cards for cryptocurrency as it adds transparency while protecting the user. Many countries have stated their message loud and clear as they pursue AML requirements and legislation which further tightens KYC and crypto together. With Web 3.0 on the horizon, however, the topic of decentralization rises again as does the fascinating new concept of online self-sovereign identity (SSI). Will regulators consider that approach when dealing with KYC and crypto? That will most likely be the main question going forward. As for now, crypto-related businesses that ensure AML compliance are unquestionably the highest ranked amongst user and investor trust, and while being fully compliant might be a hard endeavor, it seems incredibly beneficial.",

    "content": "De Nederlandsche Bank (DNB), the Dutch central Bank, fined cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase 3.3 million euros ($3.6 million), due to non-compliance with local regulations for financial service providers, according to a Reuters report on Jan 26. The exchange reportedly failed to obtain the necessary registration to offer services in the Netherlands prior to beginning operations in the country. The DNB said it took into consideration the size of Coinbase as a company and the fact that it has a \u201csignificant number of customers in the Netherlands.\u201d The authorities claimed Coinbase was non-compliant during the time period between November 2020 and August 2022. In December 2022, the DNB targeted the cryptocurrency exchange KuCoin saying that it too was operating without a license and therefore offering services illegally. In 2021 it targeted Binance Holdings Limited with similar allegations, for which the exchange paid more than 3 million euros in fines due to the violations. Related: Coinbase CEO urges Bitcoin legal tender for Brazil, Argentina \u2014 Reaction Since the beginning of the year, Coinbase has been in the headlines for numerous reasons relating to its business operations. On Jan. 10 it announced that it will be slashing 20% of its workforce due to operational restructuring. It was on this same day that the brother of the ex-manager of the crypto exchange was sentenced to 10 months in prison due to insider trading , which marked the first known case of its kind in the crypto industry. A week later on Jan. 18 Coinbase announced that it will stop its operations in Japan due to the ongoing effects of the bear market trading slump. Despite less than desirable developments from the exchange, around the same time as it closed up shop in Japan it was reported that Coinbase stock had a 69% surge from its all-time low. Additionally, Cathie Wood\u2019s ARK Investment added $17.6M in Coinbase stock since the start of 2023.",

Conway, a fierce critic of Trump, acknowledged the significance of the discoveries in all the cases. \u201cBut the fact is, because Trump pushed it so far by stonewalling justice, and refusing to produce all the documents when requested, and then lying about it through his lawyers, we now have a situation where everybody who has classified documents who shouldn\u2019t have is going to get a lot more scrutiny than they otherwise would have had if they turned them right over,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like the shoe bomber,\u201d Conway suggested, referencing British terrorist Richard Reid who in 2001 attempted to blow up an American Airlines passenger flight from Paris to Miami with explosives that he\u2019d hidden in his shoes. \u201cOne guy who tried to light his shoe as an explosive, and now all of us have to take our shoes off at the airport,\u201d he added.

Now, he\u2019s morphing into one of the three witches from Macbeth.

Trump announced his 2024 candidacy in November in a rambling speech that even some conservatives derided as \u201cpainful\u201d and \u201clow energy.\u201d He has also failed to pick up the endorsement of some key evangelical leaders, several of whom have said they will wait until the primaries are over . Advertisement Trump has slammed them for \u201c disloyalty \u201d for failing to fall in line. While Trump is still leading in some polls of potential 2024 GOP candidates, his numbers have steadily fallen to the point where some see him as vulnerable \u2015 and he may face competition from former Vice President Mike Pence , Florida Gov.

    "description": "The police body camera video showing the attack on former U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's husband at their San Francisco home last October will be released to the media on Friday morning, according to court officials.",
    "content": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 The police body camera video showing the attack on former U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's husband at their San Francisco home last October will be released to the media on Friday morning, according to court officials. A statement released by the San Francisco Superior Court said the video and audio in the case of the People vs. David DePape will be made \"available to accredited media members\" Friday morning at 9 a.m. in accordance with Judge Stephen M. Murphy's order Wednesday. Media representatives will be able to pick up the CD's containing the footage and audio recordings from clerks at the Hall of Justice once the provide identification, a completed criminal records request form and a $25 payment. The footage of the attack on Paul Pelosi is being made public after San Francisco Superior Court Judge Stephen M. Murphy denied prosecutors' request to keep it secret. Murphy ruled there was no reason to keep the footage secret, especially after prosecutors played it in open court during a preliminary hearing last month, according to Thomas R. Burke, a San Francisco-based lawyer who represented The Associated Press and a host of other news agencies including CBS News in their attempt to access the evidence. The San Francisco District Attorney's Office handed over the evidence to Murphy on Wednesday following a court hearing. Paul Pelosi, Nancy Pelosi's husband, was asleep at the couple's San Francisco home on Oct. 28 when someone broke in and beat him with a hammer. Prosecutors have charged 42-year-old David DePape in connection with the attack. ALSO READ: During a preliminary hearing last month, prosecutors played portions of Paul Pelosi's 911 call plus footage from Capitol police surveillance cameras, body cameras worn by the two police officers who arrived at the house, and video from DePape's interview with police. But when news organizations asked for copies of that evidence, the San Francisco District Attorney's Office refused to release it. The attack, which occurred just days before the 2022 midterm elections, prompted intense speculation from the public that fueled the spread of false information. The district attorney's office argued releasing the footage publicly would only allow people to manipulate it in their quest to spread false information. But the news agencies argued it was vital for prosecutors to publicly share their evidence that could debunk any false information swirling on the internet about the attack. \"You don't eliminate the public right of access just because of concerns about conspiracy theories,\" Burke said. The San Francisco District Attorney's Office did not respond to an email from The Associated Press seeking comment. The news agencies who sought the release of the footage includes The New York Times, The Washington Post, the Los Angeles Times, the San Francisco Chronicle, The Press Democrat, CNN, Fox News, ABC, NBC and KQED, an NPR-member radio station in San Francisco. DePape pleaded not guilty last month to six charges, including attempted murder. Police have said DePape told them there was \"evil in Washington\" and he wanted to harm Nancy Pelosi because she was second in line to the presidency. His case is pending. Democrats lost their majority in the House of Representatives after the midterm elections. Republicans elected California Republican U.S. Rep. Kevin McCarthy as the new speaker. Pelosi will remain in Congress, but she stepped down as Democratic leader. She was replaced by Hakeem Jeffries from New York.",

    "description": "Republicans say the move violates national party rules, resulting in less power for the state in choosing the GOP presidential nominee in 2024. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0",
    "content": "The Democratic majority in the Michigan Senate approved a measure Thursday that would move the state's presidential primary earlier in the year. The 20-18 party-line vote to shift the primary from mid-March to late February every four years is favored by Democrats, but may substantially hurt Republicans ahead of what is anticipated to be a heated election to decide the party's nominee in 2024. \"This bill uplifts the voice and vote of Michigan Democrats and Michigan Republicans, and gives every Michigander an early, deserving chance to choose the next president of the United States,\" said state Sen. Jeremy Moss, D-Southfield, the lead sponsor of the bill. Right now, the state's presidential primary is set for the second Tuesday in March every four years. The bill would move that to the fourth Tuesday in February. That would make Michigan one of the first states to hold a primary. Supporters point to the national hoopla associated with traditional first voting states Iowa and New Hampshire, arguing the attention brings more focus to local issues and concerns. But Republicans noted that their national rules are different than those of the Democratic Party. If Michigan moves its primary earlier in 2024, the national GOP would likely penalize Michigan Republicans, explained Senate Minority Leader Aric Nesbitt, R-Porter Township. More: Michigan moves one step closer to becoming early primary state for Democrats More: Michigan Democrats argue case for becoming an early presidential primary state \"If the Michigan primary takes place before March 1 of next year, Republicans would lose about 85% of the Republican delegates to the national convention. We had 72 delegates in 2020, and we'd go down to 13 delegates next year,\" he said. \"This legislation ... will, I believe, disenfranchise Michigan voters if left how it is.\" The argument did not resonate with the Democratic majority, but the GOP may ultimately achieve the outcome they want. Under Michigan Senate rules, it takes two-thirds of the members to make sure a bill goes into effect as soon as it is signed into law. Without that level of support, the law does not take effect until 90 days after the end of session. Right now, Democrats do not have enough votes to get to that threshold, meaning the bill would likely not take effect until after the prescribed 2024 primary date. The legislation was prompted by the Democratic Party's decision to revisit its calendar for which states hold presidential primary contests first. Late last year, at the direction of President Joe Biden, the party's Rules and Bylaws Committee adopted a new primary calendar for 2024 that would put South Carolina first, to be followed by Nevada, New Hampshire, Georgia and then Michigan, upending the current calendar that begins with Iowa's caucuses and then the New Hampshire primary every presidential year. However, all of the states, including Michigan, have to enact laws ensuring they can legally hold primaries on the dates preferred by the party \u2014 which still has to finalize the new calendar. The Republican Party, meanwhile, has said it would keep to the current calendar, raising questions about how this will work out between the parties come next year. While in the future moving the presidential primary may help the state, it's unclear how it would benefit Democrats in 2024. Biden has not officially said he's running for reelection, but many expect him to do so. If that's the case, it's unlikely a sitting president would face substantial opposition from his own party. But the GOP presidential primary is expected to be a raucous affair. Former President Donald Trump already indicated he's running, while Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, former Vice President Mike Pence and a slew of others are expected to weigh their own bids. If Michigan is actually penalized by the RNC for shifting its primary, that would mean the state's votes during the contest would have far less impact at the GOP's nominating convention. The bill must still pass the House and be signed by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer to become law. Free Press staff writer and Washington correspondent Todd Spangler contributed to this report.

    "description": "The measure would fully exempt public pensions from income taxes and create new deductions for other sources of retirement income. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0",
    "content": "Michiganders with public pensions and other, specific retirement accounts could soon see new tax breaks under a bill approved Thursday in the state Senate. The measure passed by a 23-15 vote, with three Republicans joining the 20 Senate Democrats to support a bill at the heart of Gov. Gretchen Whitmer's legislative agenda . However, Republicans opposed to the measure have the power to ultimately prevent it from immediately taking effect, even if it passes the House and eventually makes it to Whitmer from her signature. They wanted broader relief for more retirees, arguing the bill does not help enough Michigan seniors. More: Tax rollback? Sweetened EITC? Pension tax repeal? Michiganders could get it all. More: Buttressed by Democratic majorities, Whitmer lays out vision in State of the State speech What's in the bill? The bill restores a tax exemption for public pensions, which was removed in 2011 under then-Gov. Rick Snyder. But it also creates new deductions for other retirement accounts, like 401ks, IRAs and annuities. Public pensions would be entirely exempt from state income tax. The bill allows limited exemptions on earnings from other pension and retirement accounts: up to $56,961 for single tax filers, and $133,922 for people filing jointly. Initially, Democrats proposed the exemptions be phased in over a number of years, but amended the measure Thursday to ensure the changes would take effect for the 2023 tax year. Who does it help? Democrats note this helps people who have public pensions, chiefly those who had them before the 2011 change and expected them to remain untaxed. Any number of jobs are eligible for these pensions, from firefighters and police officers to city administrations and superintendents. Supporters, like Whitmer, note the change could help former rank-and-file workers save more of their money. Opponents argue the changes benefit a select few, including retired government executives with six-figure pensions. A Senate Fiscal Analysis of the original bill projected after full implementation, the lost tax revenue would likely top $500 million annually. More: 5 takeaways from Whitmer's State of the State speech More: Michigan Senate approves expanding tax credit for low-income workers: What it means What do supporters and opponents say? The bill offers immediate relief to a slew of Michigan seniors, argued Sen. Kevin Hertel, D-St. Clair Shores, the main sponsor of the legislation. \"My colleagues on the other side of the aisle have said that this bill would pick losers and winners. But this bill only creates more winners: no one's taxes will go up as a result of this legislation,\" Hertel said. \"This bill will enable seniors to live, work and retiree with dignity in our state. It will put an average of $1,000 back into the pockets of seniors in our communities.\" But Republicans argued the bill would only help roughly one-third of Michigan seniors, saying most do not have eligible retirement income or continue to work. Multiple GOP senators attempted in vain to amend the bill, proposing to broaden the tax benefits of the bill to more people. \"Working for the government for 30 years shouldn't entitle you to lower taxes, while someone who waited tables for 30 years will be paying full income taxes,\" said Senate Minority Leader Aric Nesbitt, R-Porter Township. \"We should provide relief to all seniors, not just a select few.\" The three Republican senators who joined their Democratic colleagues in supporting the measure were Sens. John Damoose, R-Harbor Springs; Mark Huizenga, R-Walker; and Michael Webber, R-Rochester Hills. What happens next? The House would need to approve the bill and send it back to the Senate before it could go to Whitmer for final approval. It's not immediately clear if the House will agree to support this version of the measure; Democrats and Republicans in the lower chamber have introduced their own iterations of tax relief for seniors. If it does make it back to the Senate unchanged, it does not appear that Democrats have the votes to ensure the bill could take effect immediately. Senate rules require two-thirds of all members to support a measure going into effect as soon as it's signed by the governor. That's generally 25 votes; only 23 senators voted for it Thursday. If that margin holds, then the bill would likely take effect sometime in early 2024. Contact Dave Boucher: dboucher@freepress.com.",

    "description": "The ruling reverses a lower court opinion that would've raised Michigan's minimum wage to $13.03 an hour on Feb. 19.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0",
    "content": "A three-judge Court of Appeals panel on Thursday reversed a lower court decision , preventing Michigan\u2019s hourly minimum wage from rising to $13.03 and changing the state\u2019s laws on paid sick leave on Feb. 19. The ruling likely sets up a battle at the Michigan Supreme Court between advocates who pushed for the wage and sick time changes and state attorneys. The panel, consisting of Court of Appeals Judges Christopher Murray, Michael Kelly and Michael Riordan, ruled the Michigan Legislature, controlled by Republicans at the time, did have the constitutional authority in 2018 to adopt a pair of petition initiatives and amend their respective policies, instead of having the initiatives go to the ballot that November. In a 20-page published opinion, Murray wrote there is no explicit language in the Michigan Constitution banning the Legislature from adopting laws initially brought forward by petition initiative and amending those laws in the same legislative session. \"The constitutional convention record squarely supports the conclusion that there was no intention to place a temporal limit on when the Legislature could amend initiated laws enacted by the Legislature,\" Murray wrote. Michigan's hourly minimum wage will remain at $10.10, thanks to the ruling. The tipped minimum wage remains at $3.84 an hour. The tipped minimum wage is the pay rate given to employees who are expected to make the bulk of their earnings through tips, like restaurant servers and bartenders. Had the Court of Appeals not reversed the lower ruling, the minimum hourly wage would have increased to $13.03 an hour. The tipped minimum wage would have increased to $11.73 an hour before being eliminated altogether and putting tipped employees at the regular minimum wage on Jan. 1, 2024. During oral arguments in front of the appeals panel in December, state attorneys representing Michigan\u2019s House and Senate argued the Legislature had the constitutional authority to adopt and amend the initiative in 2018, saying there was no express law preventing the tactic. Advocates for the initiatives as they were originally written say raising the minimum wage in Michigan would be a strong step toward eliminating economic barriers for the working class. The case is likely to be appealed to the state\u2019s Supreme Court. Mark Brewer, the attorney representing pro-increased wage group Mothering Justice in the case, told the panel during oral arguments, \u201cI frankly expect that at whatever decision you make, we will end up in front of the Michigan Supreme Court.\u201d In December 2019, the state's high court declined to hear the issue of adopt-and-amend. More: Michigan Legislature's handling of minimum wage, sick time laws argued in court More: Michigan's minimum wage hike resulting from judge's ruling delayed until February The Court of Appeals ruling, at least for the moment, affirms the Michigan Legislature\u2019s constitutional authority to adopt petition initiatives as law and amend the initiatives in the same legislative session. In July, Court of Claims Judge Douglas Shapiro ruled the Legislature acted unconstitutionally in 2018 when it adopted legislation created through a petition initiative originally intended to enact the wage changes, but in the same session amended the language to put in lower wage thresholds that increased the minimum wage to $12.05 by 2030 instead of 2022 and kept the tipped minimum wage at 38% of the standard one. Shapiro's ruling also addressed a separate petition initiative originally intended to require Michigan employers to provide one hour of paid sick time for every 30 hours of work. Employers with fewer than 10 employees would have to allow employees to accrue up to 40 hours of paid sick time annually, and employers with 10 or more would have to allow employees to accrue up to 72 hours of paid sick time per year. In 2018, the Legislature amended the petition to remove requirements for employers with fewer than 50 employees. While all three judges shared the same ruling opinion, Kelly wrote in a separate concurring opinion the tactic used by the Legislature was \"anti-democratic\" and circumvented the original intent of the petition initiative organizers. \"Although this procedure is permissible under the language of our constitution, this ploy \u2014 adopting an initiative into law so as to prevent it from going onto the ballot and then promptly and substantially amending that law in a manner that has left it essentially defanged \u2014 is anti-democratic,\" Kelly wrote. \"I cannot believe that this drastic action is what the drafters of our constitution even contemplated, let alone intended.\" Business and hospitality advocacy groups in Michigan had expressed concern over Shapiro's initial ruling, saying the increases to minimum wage and earned sick time, as well as the elimination of the state's tipped wage scale, would harm small business owners in Michigan. \"We are relieved and appreciative of the unanimous \u2018Adopt and Amend\u2019 decision out of the Court of Appeals today that will allow Michigan and its 18,000 restaurants and hotels to move forward with greater certainty as to their operating future. Through this ruling, countless restaurants and 50,000 hospitality jobs have been at least temporarily saved,\" Michigan Restaurant & Lodging Association President & CEO Justin Winslow said in a statement. \"We are optimistic that the Michigan Supreme Court will recognize the same and allow this industry to redirect its focus to the daunting task of recovering from a pandemic that decimated it so completely.\" Eboni Taylor, executive director of Mothering Justice, said the group will appeal Thursday's ruling. \u201cWe are extremely disappointed by the Michigan Court of Appeals decision to side with the former Republican-controlled Legislature\u2019s \u2018adopt-and-amend\u2019 shenanigans. The decision, once again, delays a much-needed and deserved pay increase for Michigan workers,\u201d Taylor said in a statement. \u201cThis is also a devastating blow to Michiganders that deserve paid sick time. The people of Michigan have long waited for earned paid sick time changes to be actualized. Everyone deserves and needs paid time off to take care of themselves or family members, and our economy will see the benefit of a labor ecosystem that honors this. We cannot delay any longer.\" Contact Arpan Lobo: alobo@freepress.com . Follow him on Twitter @arpanlobo . Become a subscriber today.",

    "content": "Our weekly roundup of news from East Asia curates the industry\u2019s most important developments. On Jan. 25, Yonhap Infomax reported that South Korean authorities had requested an arrest warrant for Kang Jong-Hyun, chairman and owner of cryptocurrency exchange Bithumb, over embezzlement allegations. That same day, the Financial Investigation Second Division of the Seoul Southern District Prosecutor\u2019s Office accused Jong-Hyun and two Bithumb executives of embezzlement, conducting fraudulent transactions and breach of trust. Authorities said that Kang played a key role in manipulating the stock prices of Bithumb affiliates Inbiogen and Bucket Studio through the issuance of convertible bonds. Bithumb is one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in South Korea . Its previous chairman, Lee Jung-Hoon, was found not guilty last month of a $70 million fraud charge related to his activities at Bithumb. Park Mo, Bithumb\u2019s former largest shareholder, died on Dec. 30 while under investigation for allegedly embezzling funds from Bithumb and related companies. The firm is also currently probed by the National Tax Service over tax compliance incidents. In its annual report released on Jan. 19, cryptocurrency exchange Binance revealed that the firm received more than 47,000 law enforcement inquiries throughout the year. The exchange said such requests were processed \u201cat a record time\u201d and that it was the first among blockchain firms to join the National Cyber-Forensics and Training Alliance, a nonprofit cybercrime fighting unit based in Pittsburg. In response to the inquiries, Binance said it increased the headcount of its security team by more than 500% and hosted 70 law enforcement workshops around the globe in 2022 to help fight blockchain-related financial crime. In the event of security incidents, Binance also stated it would tap into funds from its $1 billion SAFU (Secure Asset Fund for Users) user insurance program to compensate for losses. The exchange also tightened requirements such as NFT listings. Starting Feb. 2, Binance will delist all NFTs listed before Oct. 2 that had an average daily trading volume of less than $1,000 between Nov. 1 and Jan. 31. The exchange received 14 licenses and regulatory registrations in 2022. Other highlights include its $1 billion pledge for an industry recovery fund amid FTX\u2019s collapse and investing $500 million into Web3 and blockchain firms through Binance Labs. Although it does not have a fixed corporate office, the exchange\u2019s governing jurisdiction is the Hong Kong International Arbitration Center for legal disputes. Its servers are also reportedly located in Japan. The latest data from the website Active Player reveals that the number of players of the popular monster battle P2E game Axie Infinity, developed by Vietnamese gaming studio Sky Mavis, fell to 432,001 in the past month. This represents the lowest level seen since November and means the game has lost approximately 85% of its player base over the past year. Initially a groundbreaking GameFi success , Axie Infinity has fallen on hard times as the crypto winter took a toll on its play-to-earn dynamic, which was exacerbated by the infamous Sky Mavis Ronin bridge hack last March. New features, such as the much-anticipated Land Gameplay release on Dec. 28, did not appear to reverse the declining trend. At the time of publication, about $3.85 million worth of Axie NFTs changed hands in the past 30 days, compared with $639.5 million in November 2021. As first reported by local news outlet News 1 Korea, the city of Busan is working to establish a decentralized digital assets exchange scheduled for operations this year. According to municipal officials, the exchange will include buying and selling of tokenized intellectual property rights for films and games, as well as trade in gold, precious metals, agricultural and livestock products, ships and real estate. The Busan Digital Asset Exchange Establishment Promotion Committee plans to coordinate with domestic financial companies and conduct system tests in the near future. In a Jan. 20 Twitter thread posted by Ben Zhou, CEO of Singaporean cryptocurrency exchange ByBit, the blockchain executive clarified the exchange positions after questions arose regarding an alleged $151 million exposure to bankrupt crypto lender Genesis Global. As told by Zhou, the exposure amount is limited to Mirana, the investment arm of ByBit, and that $120 million of collateralized positions out of the $151 million exposure amount \u201chad already liquidated.\u201d Zhou claims that Mirana only manages \u201csome\u201d ByBit company assets and that clients\u2019 funds are separated. In addition, Zhou said that ByBit Earn products don\u2019t use Mirana. Genesis Global froze withdrawals last November, citing \u201cunprecedented market conditions,\u201d and filed for bankruptcy on Jan. 20, reportedly owing $3.5 billion to over 50 creditors. According to a Reuters report on Jan. 24, cryptocurrency exchange Binance allegedly helped move $346 million in Bitcoin for now-defunct Hong Kong cryptocurrency exchange Bitzlato. Binance was also reportedly one of the largest counterparties to the exchange. On Jan. 23, Europol stated that $19.5 million were seized in enforcement actions against Bitzlato. Last week, the United States Department of Justice announced a major international cryptocurrency enforcement action against Bitzlato for the latter\u2019s alleged role in laundering $700 million in funds tied to dark web marketplace Hydra and Russian illicit finance. Its founder, Anatoly Legkodymov, a Russian national and resident of China, was arrested in Miami on Jan. 18 on charges of operating an unlicensed money transmitter. The exchange has since been shut down.",

    "description": "The Raiders probably will be looking for pass catches to complement Davante Adams, Hunter Renfrow and Darren Waller. Here\u2019s some pending free agents who could fit their needs.",
    "content": "Editor\u2019s note: This is the fourth story in an eight-part series looking at NFL free agency this offseason and how it relates to the Raiders. Receiver and tight end don\u2019t jump out as a pressing need for the Raiders. Davante Adams made a smooth transition to Las Vegas, catching 100 passes for 1,516 yards and 14 touchdowns and being named to the All-Pro first team. And tight end Darren Waller and slot receiver Hunter Renfrow are exceptional players whose seasons were derailed by injuries. But a deeper look, including keeping an open mind to potentially dealing from a position of strength to fortify another part of the team, shows that the Raiders probably will be on the lookout for more weapons. Even if Adams, Renfrow and Waller return, there\u2019s no certainty that three pending free agents \u2014 tight end Foster Moreau and receivers Mack Hollins and Keelan Cole \u2014 will be back. That means the Raiders probably will need to fortify around their key players. The most pertinent need could be a viable No. 2 receiver to complement Adams \u2014 specifically, someone who adds a speed element that was lacking this season. And while the Raiders value Moreau, there\u2019s no guarantee he will return, so they could be in the market for a backup tight end. With that in mind, here are some wide receivers and tight ends to watch: Wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster, Chiefs Smith-Schuster, 26, wouldn\u2019t satisfy the Raiders\u2019 need for speed, but he would be a great fit as a second option to complement Adams. He had 78 catches for 933 yards and three touchdowns this season. He played on a one-year, $3.7 million contract, so he will be looking for a pay raise. That will come into play for the Raiders. Jakobi Meyers, Patriots Meyers, 26, has familiarity with Raiders coach Josh McDaniels, his former offensive coordinator in New England. He\u2019s coming off a season with 67 catches, 804 yards and six touchdowns, but in 2021 under McDaniels, he had 83 receptions for 866 yards. Again, money will be an issue, and Meyers is due a pay raise. But if the financials line up, he would be an ideal No. 2. Allen Lazard, Packers Lazard, 27, adds the speed element the Raiders need. He had 60 catches for 788 yards and six touchdowns this season, and those numbers would fit nicely with the Raiders. Others: D.J. Chark, Lions; Darius Slayton, Giants; Mecole Hardman, Chiefs; Jarvis Landry, Saints; Marvin Jones, Jaguars; Parris Campbell, Colts. Tight end Irv Smith, Vikings Injuries have held Smith, 24, back. His 25 catches for 182 yards and two touchdowns this season don\u2019t jump off the page, but he\u2019s an athletic weapon with upside. Playing with Waller and Adams could help. Austin Hooper, Titans Hopper, 28, is a great blocker who can also add a reliable option in the passing game. He\u2019s coming off a season with 41 catches, 444 yards and two touchdowns. In a role opposite Waller, he would be a solid option. Robert Tonyan, Packers Tonyan, 28, had 53 catches for 470 yards and two touchdowns this season and has proven to be a solid pass catcher. Hayden Hurst, Bengals Another solid complement piece, Hurst, 29, had 52 catches, 414 yards and two touchdowns this season. He\u2019s played in big games and was a reliable asset for Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow. Mike Gesicki, Dolphins An upgrade in talent and a coaching change meant Gesicki\u2019s numbers fell to 32 catches, 362 yards and five touchdowns this season. But the 27-year-old could be a great fit as a complement to Waller. Contact Vincent Bonsignore at vbonsignore@reviewjournal.com. Follow @VinnyBonsignore on Twitter.",

    "description": "Top acquisition executive Frank Calvelli said the Space Force must focus on advancing satellites systems for military operations on Earth The post Supporting military operations on Earth to remain U.S. Space Force\u2019s top priority appeared first on SpaceNews.",
    "content": "CHANTILLY, Va. \u2014 There is continuing interest in what role, if any, the U.S. Space Force will play in support of NASA in cislunar space or across the lunar surface. Those discussions are worth having but the service for now needs to keep its focus firmly on Earth, building the next generation of satellites for U.S. military operations, the Space Force\u2019s top acquisition executive Frank Calvelli said Jan. 24. \u201cI think we need to stay focused on our current missions and get those done really well,\u201d he said at the National Security Space Association\u2019s defense and intelligence conference. Calvelli, assistant secretary of the Air Force for space acquisition and integration, oversees the Space Force\u2019s procurement programs. \u201cThere\u2019s been talk of what our role in cislunar space is,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s an important talk down the road but right now what\u2019s important is tackling our core mission areas, and making sure the architecture is resilient, making sure the architecture is integrated so that [U.S. military operators] can use it effectively.\u201d Integration of space systems with air, ground and maritime platforms has emerged as a major challenge for the Space Force as military forces grow more dependent on satellites for critical operations. Connecting space and terrestrial systems is what gives forces a critical advantage, Calvelli said. Calvelli identified satellite-based communications, space domain awareness, precision navigation and timing, missile warning and tracking as \u201ccore mission areas\u201d that the Space Force has to invest in and move forward. \u201cWe have really got to take our core mission areas and transform them,\u201d he said. His remarks are in line with comments made last year by Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall at an industry conference where he said going to the moon is not currently on the list of national security priorities. \u201cI don\u2019t see a lot of interest from a defense perspective,\u201d Kendall said, noting that the United States today faces big space security challenges within Earth\u2019s orbit. Calvelli\u2019s emphasis on providing capabilities for military operations also is reflected in the recent decision to rename the Space Development Agency\u2019s planned network of military satellites in low Earth orbit. The agency\u2019s constellation previously named \u201cNational Defense Space Architecture\u201d was rebranded as the \u201cProliferated Warfighter Space Architecture.\u201d Calvelli said the term \u201cnational defense\u201d was too broad and he wanted the name to reflect SDA\u2019s focus on providing space-based capabilities for U.S. warfighters. Experiments planned in cislunar space The Air Force, nevertheless, is supporting an experiment to study the cislunar region of outer space. The Air Force Research Laboratory plans to launch a demonstration mission to deep space in 2025 to detect and track objects near the moon that cannot be viewed optically from Earth or from satellites in traditional orbits. Within the Space Force, some argue that the service needs to prepare for possible operations in cislunar space in the next decade, particularly if China or Russia move to establish a presence on the moon to exploit material and energy resources. \u201cThe United States and China are currently leading competing multi-nation efforts to send robotics and humans to the Lunar South Pole,\u201d wrote Captain Tyler Bates, a planner at the Space Force\u2019s Space Operations Command.\u200b \u201cHelium-3, iron, titanium, thorium, uranium, potassium, and rare earth elements also exist in significant concentrations across the lunar surface,\u201d Bates wrote in an article published last year in the Department of the Air Force\u2019s Journal of Strategic Airpower & Spacepower. \u201cThe United States should not cede access to this emerging economic zone of activity to nations notorious for claiming territory and resources by force or threat of force such as Russia or China,\u201d Bates argued. To provide security in the lunar region, the Space Force would have to deploy \u201cenabling capabilities including satellite communications, position, navigation, and timing, space domain awareness, and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance space systems.\u201d",

    "description": "Some who work in low wage jobs, including first-time parents, don't realize that the Earned Income Tax Credit is a way to get a big tax refund. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0",
    "content": "Hard to imagine anyone walking away from a few hundred dollars or possibly even $5,000 or more, but plenty of working people lose out each year on a valuable tax credit simply because they don't file a tax return. Many aren't required to file because their incomes are so low that they're not obligated to file a return. So they don't bother. But many would qualify for the Earned Income Tax Credit, which surely would make all the tax-time hassle very much worth it. Many might not realize that they qualify for a key tax credit. If you're earning very little money, for example, you don't have to have children to qualify for some money through the earned income credit. And some first-time parents may not know they are eligible. The average amount of Earned Income Tax Credit received nationwide in 2022 was about $2,043. The tax refund could be used to pay high heating bills, pay down credit cards, cover a major home repair, buy a car or even save for the future. The earned income credit is refundable \u2014 which means that even workers who did not earn enough money to have taxes withheld can receive hundreds or thousands of dollars in a tax refund for the earned income credit. Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan once again tried to build awareness of the tax credit at an afternoon event Thursday, driving home the point that the extra tax money is valuable to struggling families and others. The event included groups that offer no-cost tax preparation services to many in Michigan. Duggan said noted that many wealthy people have all sorts of tax breaks to consider, but \"the Earned Income Tax Credit is the tax break for people of lower income. It's your tax break.\" Many times, he said, he's talked with people who are shocked that they received $800 or $1,200 more as a tax refund. \"They just don't believe a tax break is ... for low income (people),\" he said. \"This is real.\" He said the outreach efforts are designed to make sure \"every Detroiter has the help they need to file their taxes, especially if they haven\u2019t filed in the past.\u201d Priscilla Perkins, president and CEO of the Accounting Aid Society, said people may be reluctant file a tax return because of misinformation. Word of mouth on the street, she said, is wrong if they say that people risk losing other federal benefits, such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program , known as \"SNAP,\" if they file a federal tax return, claim the Earned Income Tax Credit and receive a sizable refund. While many who have very low incomes aren't required to file a tax return, she said, they should file one to claim important tax credits that can help pay bills. The dollar amount that households receive will vary significantly and depend on your pay, filing status, and the size of your family. You need to have worked in 2022. Lawrence Hargrave, who attended the press event Thursday at the Ford Resource and Engagement Center on Detroit's east side, works as a security guard at the Amtrak station in Detroit and has five children, ages 12, 10, 6, 3 and 2. His mother prepares taxes as part of the free program offered at the Ford Resource and Engagement Center and encouraged him to get his taxes done for free at the center, staffed by Accounting Aid Society volunteers. After paying for years to get his taxes done, he got his taxes done for free last year at the center. His tax refund, he said, ended up being about $5,000 last year, including the Earned Income Tax Credit. He was surprised at how quickly the money was deposited into a popular mobile app that he uses for banking. He's not sure what his refund will be this year \u2014 he's still waiting on his W-2 information \u2014 but he plans to get his taxes done for free again. What's kind of money can you get? In Michigan, the maximum earned income credit for both the federal and state credit adds up to a maximum of $594 for a lower income worker who has no qualifying children but had an income that is less than $16,480 if single or head of household or an income of less than $22,610 if married and filing jointly. The combined federal and state of Michigan earned income credits can climb up to a maximum of $7,351 for a family with three or more qualifying children. The family must have an income that is less than $53,057 if single or filing as head of household or an income of less than $59,187 if married and filing jointly. The federal Earned Income Tax credit alone ranges from a maximum of $560 for a qualifying individual with no children to up to $6,935 for a qualifying family with three children or more. The federal credit offers a maximum amount of $3,733 for one qualifying child in 2022 and a maximum of $6,164 for two qualifying children in 2022. The federal credit, which dates back to 1975, is designed to encourage work and recognizes that extra costs associated with holding down a job can discourage low-income wage earners from working. It is a key measure, according to advocates, for lifting children out of poverty. Substantial expansions to the federal program were adopted in 1986, 1990, and 1993. How does the earned income credit work in Michigan? Currently, the state of Michigan offers extra money through a state earned income credit that amounts to 6% of the federal credit. The extra Michigan credit is $34 for a tax filers with no qualifying children, based on a maximum federal credit of $560. With no qualifying children, the maximum federal credit is $560 so the maximum Michigan credit at 6% is $34. The Michigan credit then can be a maximum of $224 with one child, $370 with two qualifying children or a maximum of $416 with three or more qualifying children. It's important for those who qualify for the federal earned income credit to file a state return, as well, when a state, like Michigan, offers its own earned income credit. More: Tax rollback? Sweetened EITC? Pension tax repeal? Michiganders could get it all. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer wants an expanded earned income credit Going forward, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said she wants to significantly increase the state's earned income credit for an estimated 700,000 families. Whitmer calls the state's effort the Working Families Tax Credit. On Thursday, the Michigan Senate passed a bill to create the Working Families Tax Credit , which would increase a state's match for the federal earned income credit to 30% \u2014 up from 6% currently \u2014 for qualifying taxpayers. Duggan, who attended Whitmer's State of the State address Wednesday, noted that there was one time that both Democrats and Republicans stood up and cheered together during that speech \"and it wasn't for the Detroit Lions.\" Instead, members of both parties applauded in agreement on expanding the state's earned income credit in some fashion. Others elsewhere have pushed in the past few years to enhance the state earned income credits. At 6% of the federal credit, experts say, Michigan currently has one of the least generous programs in the country. The New York City earned income credit \u2014 which was expanded in 2022 \u2014 ranges from 10% to 30% based on a taxpayer\u2019s New York adjusted gross income. Under New York City\u2019s expansion of the earned income credit, a single parent with one child with an income of $14,750 received $905 instead of $181. The credit had not been increased for almost 20 years. In Wisconsin, for example, the state's earned income credit ranges from 4% of the federal credit allowed to an individual for a family with one child, going up to 11% for a family with two children and then reaching up to 34% for a family with three or more qualifying children. More: Many families could see drastically smaller tax refunds in 2023: Here\u2019s why More: IRS tax season to begin Jan. 23: What to know about smaller refunds Billions of dollars going unclaimed The Internal Revenue Service estimates that nationwide only four out of five of eligible workers claim and get their Earned Income Tax Credit. So roughly 20% who qualify don\u2019t get their money, leaving billions of dollars going unclaimed. Nationwide, more than 31 million workers and families received about $64 billion for the earned income credit as of December, according to the Internal Revenue Service. In 2022, Detroiters claimed more than $260 million in earned income credit refunds alone. Many received even more money through other tax benefits, such as the Child Tax Credit. A real push has been made in the past few years by community leaders and others to make sure people take advantage of free tax preparation services and claim valuable tax credits. More: Tax rollback? Sweetened EITC? Pension tax repeal? Michiganders could get it all. Before 2017, it was estimated that $80 million in potential tax refunds went unclaimed each year by Detroiters who were eligible for the earned income credit. Get free help for a complex credit The credit has several key rules, and frankly, is easier to handle if someone else does it for you, such as a trained volunteer at a free tax preparation site . In Michigan, free tax preparation services are offered to those with lower incomes and others by the Accounting Aid Society , Wayne Metropolitan Community Action Agency and sites for the AARP Foundation Tax-Aide Program. Those in metro Detroit can call the United Way for Southeastern Michigan at 2-1-1 or visit www.getthetaxfacts.org to learn more and schedule an appointment for free tax help. Or see IRS.gov for information on a long list of free tax return preparation for qualifying taxpayers and events in your area, including free tax help at libraries, community centers, schools and shopping malls. In general, volunteer income tax assistance sites offer free tax help to those who generally make $60,000 or less; persons with disabilities and limited English-speaking taxpayers. The sites are staffed by volunteers and run by IRS partners. More: 2023 tax season guide for new parents: What to know about the Child Tax Credit and more Matt Hetherwick, director of individual tax programs for the nonprofit Accounting Aid Society in Detroit, said every dollar matters for clients served by the volunteers. He stressed that the earned income credit is money that applies to qualifying working families and individuals but it can only be claimed by filing your tax return. \"It is your money, claim it,\" Hetherwick said. The rules for the Earned Income Tax Credit can be complex and things can change over time. On 2022 returns, for example, the earned income credit rules will revert back to pre-2021 rules for age limits. On 2022 returns, the minimum age for a taxpayer to qualify is 25 as of Dec. 31 on the 2022 federal income tax return; the maximum age is 64 as of Dec. 31 for those without qualifying children. In 2021, a temporary break was given to expand the credit. For 2021 returns only, the minimum age limit was dropped to 24 years of age for a full-time student, 18 years of age for a qualified former foster youth or a qualified homeless youth, or 19 years of age for all others. Currently, workers who are age 65 and older no longer qualify for the Earned Income Tax Credit if they do not have dependent children. The credit had applied to older workers for one year on 2021 returns. This year, they would not even qualify for the lower $560 credit for 2022. Last year, the credit was worth nearly $1,500 for those without children who qualified. Hetherwick said earlier he doesn't have a number for how many clients could see a smaller refund because of the changes. When it comes to the earned income credit, it's helpful to know: The child or children you claim for the credit must be related to you, but grandparents who are raising children can qualify. The child or children must live in the same home as you do for more than half of the tax year. The tax filer needs to make sure that the Social Security number and name on the tax return are exactly how they appear on the Social Security card for everyone listed on that return. How long will I wait for a tax refund? Taxpayers may file their returns now. The deadline is April 18. But taxpayers need to realize that they will not receive a refund before mid-February if they claim the Earned Income Tax Credit or the additional Child Tax Credit. The IRS cannot issue refunds involving these credits any earlier. Extra time is given under the law for the IRS to review returns to prevent fraud. The \"Where's My Refund?\" tool on IRS.gov should show an updated status by Feb. 18, according to the Internal Revenue Service, for most early filers who claim the earned income credit and the additional child credit. The IRS said most of these refunds should be available in taxpayer bank accounts or on debit cards by Feb. 28 if people file early, choose direct deposit and there are no other issues with their tax return.

    "content": "Demolition of the old and sprawling Southwestern High School in Detroit is nearing completion. Crews from Adamo Demolition started ripping through the long-vacant school building at 6921 W. Fort St. the week after Christmas, a neighbor said, and little of the structure is still standing this week. The school site is owned by Dan Gilbert's real estate firm Bedrock, which acquired it in 2020 as part of a $38.5 million deal for nearby office and industrial buildings on 37 acres, including the campus of defunct auto supplier Sakthi Automotive Group USA. The site also is near the future Gordie Howe International Bridge. A Bedrock representative didn't return a message Thursday for comment about its future plans for the site. More: Packard Plant in Detroit slowly disappearing as 2nd part of demolition begins More: New owner of Continental Motors plant confirms plans to demolish ruins, build self-storage Southwestern dates to 1921 and had athletic fields as well as an indoor swimming pool. It closed in 2012 amid falling enrollment across Detroit Public Schools. The school's alumni include basketball player and sports analyst Jalen Rose and Ben Carson, the famed neurosurgeon and former Secretary of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. The demolition was the subject earlier this month of a podcast called Mr. P's Tales from the Road . The podcast's host, who in social media posts identifies himself as Brandon Parsons , a photographer and explorer of abandoned buildings, recalled visiting the empty school nearly a dozen times over the years and said in the podcast that seeing it get demolished \"kind of hit me in the gut.\" He did not respond to a Free Press question for his location. He noted how demolition also recently got underway at a slew of other prominent empty buildings in the city, including the former American Motors Corporation headquarters , the old Continental Motors Co. plant and the notorious Packard Plant. \u201cDetroit is losing all of its abandoned buildings,\" the host said. \"I know we\u2019ve had that argument before, where it\u2019s bad for our hobby but it\u2019s good for the city, but it really hits you when these are places that you\u2019ve spent time in them \u2014 and they\u2019re gone.\" Bedrock announced last summer that it had struck a five-year leasing deal with Highland Park-based Diversified Synergies for about 200,000-square-feet of space in the former Sakthi Industrial Campus, now known as Bedrock's Fort Street Industrial Campus. Diversified Synergies moved in in August and, depending on business volume, has roughly 300 to 700 workers at the site for its packaging operation, a company official said.

    "description": "Most meteorites that make it to the earth\u2019s surface are smaller than a grain of sand, says Field Museum research scientist Maria Valdes.",
    "content": "The team of scientists had already combed over miles of Antarctic ice field, ready to turn around at the very end of an 11-day meteorite hunt. Then they spotted something rare. The international team knew what they were looking at from 100 meters away: a huge meteorite \u201cthe size of a gourd,\u201d recalled Field Museum research scientist Maria Valdes, who was part of the team. Advertisement \u201cTo put the meteorite\u2019s size in perspective, of the 45,000 meteorites retrieved from Antarctica over the last century, only 100 are this size or larger,\u201d the Field Museum said. The Jan. 5 discovery was made during a survey of terrain that scientists had never before hunted for meteorites. The lucky team of researchers from America, Belgium and Switzerland found five total meteorites on their 11-day trip, including the big one. Advertisement \u201cWe were sort of like pioneers going into the unknown,\u201d Valdes said. The first seven days were spent on rocky terrain, where ordinary rocks can sometimes be confused with meteorites. The last four days were spent on Antarctica\u2019s blue ice fields, she said. The ice field searches were done on snowmobiles. The scientists drove in a V-formation, traveling at slower speeds of about 6 mph so that the scientists could survey the region, she said. It was only when they were about to turn around and finish their survey that they spotted the meteorite, Valdes said. \u201cWhen we saw this one just sitting by itself in the middle of the blue ice, we all got so excited,\u201d she said. The researchers exchanged hesitant glances. \u201cBecause we knew that if we found a meteorite, this was really the mother lode. On the last day, the last hour.\u201d One telltale clue that the scientists had discovered a meteorite and not a rock was that it was \u201cthe size of a bowling ball, but twice the weight of a bowling ball,\u201d Valdes said. The meteorite was 16.7 pounds, but heft isn\u2019t everything. \u201cSize doesn\u2019t necessarily matter when it comes to meteorites, and even tiny micrometeorites can be incredibly scientifically valuable,\u201d Valdes said. The meteorite had what Valdes called a \u201cfusion crust,\u201d meaning that it had a thin glassy crust that showed it had slightly melted when it entered Earth\u2019s atmosphere. The crust was worn down, indicating that the meteorite had long been on the planet. Advertisement The meteorite\u2019s chemistry composition is going to be examined in Belgium, where scientists will \u201cstudy its make up and search for potential micrometeorites,\u201d the museum said in a news release. Studying the meteorite will help scientists learn more about the history of the solar system and Earth itself. Meteorites offer scientists a rare look at the chemical compositions of other planets and asteroids. That in turn allows builds a better understanding of Earth\u2019s deep history, which is sometimes \u201coverprinted\u201d compared with \u201cpristine\u201d meteorites, Valdes said. \u201cAll meteorites have something to say about the evolution of Earth,\u201d she said. The best time to find a meteorite in Antarctica is during polar summer, in December and January, Valdes said. Scientists are drawn to the continent because meteorites are much easier to find in Antarctica\u2019s empty, snowy climate. But the bits of space are everywhere, covering Earth in a \u201cthin layer of space dust,\u201d she said. Most of the meteorites found on Earth\u2019s surface are quite small.

    "content": "What were once luxury apartments became a depressing eyesore. Now new life is being breathed into the three-story brownstone near the corner of Park and E. Franklin avenues. The century-old apartment building at 628 E. Franklin Av. has been vacant, occasionally boarded and fully gutted for nearly 25 years. Would-be developers have come and gone , stymied by financing troubles and legal squabbles. \"It's been a hot spot for squatters and for vandalism,\" said Maggy Otte, community development projects manager at HOPE Community, a nonprofit that has rehabbed hundreds of affordable apartments in the vicinity. \"I think it communicates something about how the city has left this to be an eyesore, to be a blight on this community.\" The building has passed in and out of city ownership since 2000. Last summer, plans were set in motion to sell it to City of Lakes Community Land Trust and HOPE Community. The sale was completed in the fall with substantial assistance from the city, including $1.3 million through the federal Community Development Block Grant and $2.4 million in American Rescue Plan funding. The goal is to convert the building into seven condo units affordable to households earning at or below 60% area median income, or $40,000 to $60,000. Construction is now underway and due for completion in October. The finished homes \u2014 six family-sized three-bedroom condos and one one-bedroom condo \u2014 are expected to be sold late this year or early 2024. The building was constructed in 1904 and is eligible for listing on the National Historic Register. The redevelopment will include a wheelchair-accessible back entrance, but the rest of the exterior will be restored to its original appearance, with detailed brickwork on the fa\u00e7ade and quoining around the corners, said architect Marnie Peichel. \"It's been a very challenging project, but a very fun project to be able to work on,\" she said. \"It's been this infamous building that everyone knows is there, and it's this cool-looking building where we're all waiting for something to happen.\" HOPE will prioritize potential buyers who have been longtime renters in the surrounding Phillips community. Homeownership is a way to build wealth. But for many, with real estate prices so high, the goal is out of reach, said HOPE Executive Director Shannon Smith Jones. \"I'm really excited that in this space, we'll be able to make something available to those that normally don't have access.\" The Twin Cities area has some of the most pronounced racial disparities in homeownership in the country because of centuries of policy excluding people of color from opportunities to build generational wealth, according to Roxanne Kimball, the city's manager of residential and real estate development. As a result, the parts of Minneapolis where redlining concentrated people of color tend to be the same places where the foreclosure crisis of 2008 hit hardest and where investment-driven purchases of single-family homes are causing property values to rapidly outstrip local income growth: north and south-central Minneapolis. The city considers its investment part of its Minneapolis Homes strategy to eliminate racial disparities in homeownership.",

    "content": "Only an elite group of 17 artists so far have achieved EGOT status, winning an Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony. The rare and coveted EGOT is not easy to come by, so it\u2019s not surprising that fewer than two dozen have achieved this status. And while the artists don\u2019t get a final EGOT trophy when it happens, its nonetheless one of show business\u2019 greatest honors. Advertisement So, who does have the EGOT? Andrew Lloyd Webber, John Legend, Tim Rice, Rita Moreno, Audrey Hepburn, Mel Brooks, Mike Nichols, Whoopi Goldberg, Helen Hayes, Marvin Hamlisch, Robert Lopez, Richard Rogers, John Gielgud, Jonathan Tunick, Alan Menken, Jennifer Hudson and Scott Rudin are those who have won all four awards competitively. Advertisement While Barbara Streisand, James Earl Jones, Harry Belafonte, Quincy Jones and Liza Minnelli have all received honorary non-competitive awards, not everyone considers them to be EGOT achievements. Next up, Viola Davis is in the running to achieve EGOT. Davis landed her first Grammy nomination in the audiobook, narration and storytelling recording category for her memoir \u201cFinding Me.\u201d Davis already has two Tony Awards, a Primetime Emmy for \u201cHow to Get Away With Murder\u201d and an Oscar for the 2016 film \u201cFences.\u201d Rogers was the first to get to EGOT when he finally won an Emmy Award in 1962 for Outstanding Achievement in Original Music Composed for Television for \u201cWinston Churchill: The Valiant Years.\u201d Lopez is the only person to double-EGOT when he won a best original song Oscar for \u201cCoco\u2019s\u201d \u201cRemember Me.\u201d He made the history books by becoming the youngest to EGOT when he won the \u201cFrozen\u201d Oscar, which completed his original EGOT.

    "content": "The 1966 Batmobile was a work of art, a true symbol of justice and power. Driven by Adam West, it was the brainchild of legendary car designer George Barris, who was tasked with creating a vehicle that would strike fear into the hearts of criminals and bring hope to the citizens of Gotham City. The result was a sleek, black machine that looked like nothing else on the road. The 1966 Batmobile quickly became a cultural icon , inspiring countless imitators and inspiring a generation of fans. Kids everywhere dreamed of getting behind the wheel of this amazing machine, and even grown-ups couldn't help but be in awe of its sleek lines and advanced technology. Case in point: an Ohio man, only known on YouTube as the Batcarguy , who made a replica of the Caped Crusader's iconic vehicle. And frankly, he was successful in doing so. According to the creator, people ask him if the buttons and switches work at car shows. Even better, the guy recreated a chase scene with the joker, intended to \"demonstrate\" the car's gadgets. You can watch that scene in the embedded video above. We're not sure of the base vehicle for this replica, but it's important to note that the on-screen version was based on the 1955 Lincoln Futura concept car . Modern Batmobiles: The Batmobile was equipped with a wealth of gadgets and weapons, from a Batcomputer that could track criminals and decode encrypted messages, to a Batray that could project a smokescreen or a bat-shaped emblem to confuse and disorient its enemies. But what truly set the Batmobile apart was its incredible speed and agility. With its powerful engine and low, aerodynamic design, the Batmobile was able to outrun any other car on the road, leaving criminals and their getaway vehicles far behind. It's cool to see all those things in Batcarguy's replica. We're not sure about that last bit about performance, though.",

    "content": "Cardano wallets have grown significantly in the month of January, adding more than 50k wallets according to stats from Cardano Blockchain Insights. To go even further, on January 1, there were a total of 51,868 wallets added to the network, taking the number of registered wallets from 3,842,867 to 3,894,735 as of January 25. An average of 2,075 new wallets have been opened every day on the Cardano blockchain in less than a month, demonstrating an increase in interest and activity from potential new investors. Overall, the network witnessed tremendous traction in various sectors, including decentralized finance [DeFi] and nonfungible tokens [NFTs]. Especially, over the past month, Cardano\u2019s ADA registered substantial growth. The eighth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap is up nearly 50 percent year-to-date [YTD] and some experts predict a further uptrend in the coming weeks. The upcoming debut of Djed, the network\u2019s stablecoin, is possibly the main factor driving Cardano\u2019s ascent this month. Djed is an algorithmic stablecoin that is overcollateralized and pegged to the US Dollar. Additionally, it employs a rigorous verification procedure, making it one of the first stablecoins on the market. This indicates that it can be verified quantitatively and does not necessitate a bank\u2019s audit of its collateral reserves. Djed was slated to launch sometime over the next week, according to a tweet from Cardano\u2019s Twitter account on January 24. Interested parties will have to swap for Djed when it is released into the market. Apart from that, the project\u2019s creators disclosed that traders and investors will get extra benefits when they stake ADA to get Djed. This might have acted as an incentive, in the form of increased demand for ADA, which has led to an upswing over the previous several weeks. Not all of what has contributed to ADA\u2019s recent growth spike is related to the imminent launch of Djed. The coin is gaining momentum due to a few additional network improvements. For instance, Cardano recently disclosed a CIP-30 update that was scheduled. If adopted, this upgrade suggestion will make it possible for hot wallets powered by Cardano to communicate with web2 services like Amazon. In the future, this might increase the utility and need for ADA.",

    "content": "Photo: The Canadian Press SPINDLERUV MLYN, Czech Republic (AP) \u2014 American skier Mikaela Shiffrin posted the fastest time in the opening run of a women\u2019s World Cup slalom Saturday, positioning herself for her 85th career victory. If Shiffrin wins the race, she would move within one of the World Cup record of 86 wins set by Swedish great Ingemar Stenmark in the 1980s. Shiffrin had shared the women\u2019s record of 82 wins with former teammate Lindsey Vonn before triumphing at back-to-back giant slaloms in Italy this week. On Saturday, the American was 0.29 seconds faster than Lena D\u00fcrr of Germany, and Olympic slalom champion Petra Vlhov\u00e1 of Slovakia trailed by 0.46 in third. \u201cIn the end, good skiing and I\u2019m happy with that,\u201d Shiffrin said. The rest of the field was more than a second off the pace. Lower-ranked skiers were still coming down the course. Shiffrin, racing at the resort where she had her World Cup debut as a 15-year-old almost 12 years ago, had a fast start and already led her competitors by at least a quarter of a second at the first intermediate time. She also gained time on most racers in a tricky passage halfway through her run, where the course set allowed various ways to pass the gates. \u201cYou could ski it either way,\u201d Shiffrin said. \u201cI was able to really carry a lot of speed on the end of the course. In the end, I felt very good on my run.\u201d The American has won four of the seven slaloms this season and is chasing her 11th victory of the season. Only twice in her career has she won more than 11 races in a single season: 12 in 2017-18 and a record 17 in 2018-19. ___",

    "content": "Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek has announced details of her urgent request to state lawmakers to invest $130 million toward reducing the number of unsheltered Oregonians in 2023. There are approximately 18,000 Oregonians experiencing homelessness in Oregon, and approximately 11,000 of those households are unsheltered, according to a release from Kotek's office. The governor's investment request has been paired with a statewide emergency order declaring a Homelessness State of Emergency, signed on Jan. 10, the during Kotek's first full day in office. The spending plan The spending package will aim to provide immediate relief to at least 1,200 unsheltered Oregonians, prevent nearly 9,000 households from becoming homeless, expand the state\u2019s shelter capacity by 600 new beds, increase sanitation services, and ensure a coordinated, equitable response to the homelessness emergency. The package will invest in both statewide strategies as well as focused investments to reduce unsheltered homelessness in emergency areas. Kotek said she she has had preliminary conversations with legislative leaders and looks forward to working with them to finalize the package. The Governor's initial proposal includes the following elements: Prevent vulnerable households from becoming homeless $33.6 million to prevent 8,750 households from becoming homeless by funding rent assistance and other eviction prevention services. Add shelter beds and housing navigators $23.8 million to add 600 low-barrier shelter beds statewide and hire more housing navigators to ensure unsheltered Oregonians can get connected to the shelter and services they need. Rehouse unsheltered households $54.4 million to rehouse at least 1,200 unsheltered households by funding prepaid rental assistance, block leasing at least 600 vacant homes, landlord guarantees and incentives, and other re-housing services. Support Oregon Tribes $5 million to support emergency response directly to the nine sovereign tribes in the State of Oregon. Ensure equitable outcomes $5 million to increase capacity for culturally responsive organizations to support equitable outcomes of the homelessness state of emergency. Support local sanitation services $2 million to support local communities for sanitation services. Coordinate emergency response $1.8 million to support the emergency response being coordinated by the Office of Emergency Management and Oregon Housing and Community Services. Kotek said these urgent investments will address the homelessness emergency facing communities across Oregon today, but it is only one piece of the larger strategy required to address this humanitarian crisis. The Governor\u2019s recommended budget builds on these targeted investments to ensure that the state is reducing homelessness and providing resources to address this issue in every corner of Oregon, according to the release. Oregon must simultaneously address its lack of affordable housing, according to Kotek. That will take local, state, federal, nonprofit, and private sectors working together to make progress towards an ambitious statewide housing production target of 36,000 homes per year\u2014an 80 percent increase over recent construction trends, the release states. \u201cI am urging the legislature to take up this investment package as quickly as possible,\" Kotek said. \"Unsheltered Oregonians need relief now, and our local communities need the support to provide that relief. This is only the first step. Together, we can act with the urgency people across our state are demanding. Bold ideas, concrete solutions, disciplined follow through.

    "description": "Rodney King's daughter sickened by Tyre Nichols' beating at the hands of Memphis cops three decades after LAPD attack on her father",
    "content": "More than 30 years after footage of Rodney King\u2019s brutal assault at the hands of LAPD shocked the country, his daughter watched video released on Friday of Tyre Nichols being fatally beaten by Memphis police. The similarities were heartbreaking. \u201cIt\u2019s sickening. I don\u2019t feel well. It\u2019s not a good feeling. I don\u2019t wish that upon anybody\u2019s family,\u201d Lora Dene King, 38, tells Rolling Stone . \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone should go through something like that. I don\u2019t see how people are okay, because I\u2019m not. I\u2019m human, and if you\u2019re human, you shouldn\u2019t be okay with that video.\u201d Lora was seven years old when her dad was struck with batons, kicked, and Tasered by a group of LAPD officers in a shameful show of police brutality captured on the new camcorder of neighborhood witness George Holliday in March 1991. Unlike Nichols, King survived his attack. But he was never the same, Lora says. \u201cEven though he didn\u2019t physically die, a big part of him died that night. He suffered permanent brain damage,\u201d she says. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t okay. He never was after that day. I wasn\u2019t okay, so I can only imagine what my dad felt.\u201d (King died from an accidental drowning in June 2012 at age 47.) Lora spoke to Rolling Stone Friday evening outside a theater in Inglewood, Calif., after joining community activists including Najee Ali to watch the video of Nichols\u2019s beating. She was horrified that the clips released by Memphis Police paralleled many details of her father\u2019s case, including the flippant manner adopted by the officers. In Nichols\u2019s case, the officers were captured on bodycam video boasting about how they chased and beat the 29-year-old Black man. Some of them were laughing. Lora recalled how one of her father\u2019s arresting officers, Laurence Powell, referred to her King\u2019s beating as hitting \u201ca home run.\u201d \u201cThat man was begging for his life. He begged for his mother,\u201d she said of Nichols. \u201cThat\u2019s sick to me. That\u2019s very sick. I don\u2019t even know what to feel about that, that\u2019s weird to me\u2026 [And] they were referencing as if was on drugs, or whatever the case may be. That doesn\u2019t justify killing a man or beating him to death. It doesn\u2019t justify it.\u201d Editor\u2019s picks The 200 Greatest Singers of All Time The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time The 100 Greatest TV Shows of All Time The 100 Best Albums of 2022 Lora, now the mother of a three-year-old son, was saddened that three decades after her dad\u2019s beating and more than two years after George Floyd died at the hands of Minneapolis police, not one of the cops on the scene in Memphis intervened to save Nichols. \u201cI definitely think more training is necessary but obviously the training that\u2019s being produced is not working, because it\u2019s the same thing,\u201d Lora says. She believes officers should undergo routine mental evaluations. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t just be when they\u2019re sworn in. It should be a regular thing. Because nobody human could do something like that,\u201d she says. \u201cThey\u2019re exposed to different things that normal people are not.\u201d To those who might defend the officers\u2019 actions, saying Nichols ran away, Lora points out that the Memphis officers were aggressive from the start and fired a Taser at him when he was unarmed and cooperating. \u201cI don\u2019t promote running, but then again, if you see repetitive things of Black men being murdered, you\u2019re going to run too, because, what else do you do?\u201d she says. \u201cWhen they initially pulled him over, he was like, \u2018What are you pulling me over?\u2019 He was very respectful. And they were cussing \u2013 every cuss word you can think of I heard out of their mouth. That\u2019s unnecessary.\u201d Nichols died on Jan. 10 from his injuries. The officers who beat Nichols have been charged with murder . The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation , the Justice Department, and the FBI are investigating. She lamented that Nichols cried out for his mother as his life started to slip away just 100 yards from her home. \u201cHe was begging them. He was begging for his life.\u201d",

    "content": "Whilst the upcoming \u201cScream VI\u201d marks a return of the creative team and key cast from the fifth film, this one takes a quite different approach that mostly ditches the meta take on legacy sequels of the fifth movie. The result is a film that\u2019s decidedly darker, less self-referential and tries some things the series hasn\u2019t really done before \u2013 and not just the change of setting from the sleepy town of Woodsboro to the hustle and bustle of New York City. The two trailers so far have shown the shift in tone, with the Ghostface killer of this outing having no issue striking out in public and using methods he previously hasn\u2019t used before (including a shotgun). Speaking with ahead of the movie\u2019s release, the film\u2019s directors Tyler Gillett and Matt Bettinelli-Olpin opened up about the new entry and how Ghostface this time out will be a much more bold, violent and lethal figure than in entries past. Bettinelli-Olpin says: \u201cWe wanted to make this really different, while still having all the stuff you love. Having a bolder, more brazen Ghostface was a big part of that.\u201d Gillett says another big change to this entry is a faster pace than a typical \u201cScream\u201d movie thanks to less stopping to converse about other movies by the characters: \u201cIt really moves like it\u2019s on rocket fuel. You sit down, it starts, and the movie is just a ride. You get off two hours later, and you feel like you haven\u2019t taken a breath. This starts, and it just goes. So there aren\u2019t really these large pockets to talk about other movies. It, of course, has all of the fun nods and meta-commentary. But we really loved how accelerated this story is. It felt like a reflection of how accelerated the process of making it was.\u201d The new film sees the four survivors of the last movie \u2013 Sam (Melissa Barrera), Tara (Jenna Ortega), Mindy (Jasmin Savoy Brown) and Chad (Mason Gooding) \u2013 start a fresh chapter in New York, only to find it even less safe than what they left behind. Dermot Mulroney, Samara Weaving, Tony Revolori, Jack Champion, Liana Liberato, Devyn Nekoda, Josh Segarra and Henry Czerny also star in \u201cScream VI\u201d which opens in cinemas on March 10th.",

It happened again recently with his latest list of 2022 viewing revealing three of his own works \u2013 the soon-to-release \u201cMagic Mike\u2019s Last Dance,\u201d the already announced HBO Max mini-series \u201cFull Circle\u201d, and an unknown title called \u201cThe Pendulum Project\u201d. Soderbergh hasn\u2019t gone into specifics over what that last one is, but has uncovered some details. The project is a TV series and reportedly a satire with sci-fi aspects, though specifics of the plot are very much under wraps. Their sources allege it was made in collaboration with American author, journalist and radio host Kurt Anderson along with Soderbergh\u2019s longtime filmmaking friend Greg Mottola (\u201cConfess, Fletch,\u201d \u201cSuperbad\u201d). Shot primarily in New York, in and around Tribeca, the cast reportedly includes Michael Cera and comedian Roy Wood Jr. in every episode, along with Liev Schreiber in a supporting role. The independently financed project is expected to be shopped around to a streamer or cable network once it\u2019s finished. Soderbergh has \u201cMagic Mike\u2019s Last Dance\u201d in cinemas next Friday, February 10th, whilst \u201cFull Circle\u201d is expected to debut sometime in the Spring. Thus we should hear more about this soon when Soderbergh starts doing press in regards to those projects.",

    "content": "Bitcoin ( BTC ) spiked into key liquidity for a third time into Jan. 29 as the weekly and monthly closes loomed. Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD briefly hitting $24,498 on Bitstamp overnight. The move, although short lived, marked the pair's third such attempt to take sell-side liquidity above $23,400 in recent days. In each instance, bulls appeared to lack momentum to reclaim new support levels, and at the time of writing, the status quo remained the same, with Bitcoin trading just below liquidity at $23,250.

As of Jan. 27, resistance was stacked at $23,200, $24,500 and $25,000, with the latter nonetheless still on traders' radar as a potential next target. \"$25,000 target in sight,\" a confident Crypto Tony told Twitter followers in part of comments on the day. Crypto Tony additionally expected a move higher on altcoins, with the overall crypto market cap set for a retest of resistance above the $1 trillion mark. \"I am still looking for a decent move up over the next few weeks, BUT Be cautious when we begin tapping the $1.2 - $1.33 trillion market cap resistance level. This is a significant level and I expect strong resistance here,\" he wrote on Jan. 28. Like others, however, Crypto Tony remained cautious on longer timeframes, keeping the door open for a new macro low to appear on Bitcoin and altcoins at some point in 2023. Among them is fellow commentator Il Capo of Crypto, who in an update on the day avoided technical analysis to state that he remained \"short and strong\" BTC. \"Interesting week ahead,\" he added.

    "content": "Scientists have discovered a plant toxin whose unique method of dispatching bacteria could be used to create a powerful new range of antibiotics. The prospect of developing new antibacterial drugs this way has been hailed by doctors, who have been warning for many years that the steady rise of multidrug-resistant pathogens such as E coli now present a dangerous threat to healthcare across the planet. The new antibiotic \u2013 albicidin \u2013 attacks bacteria in a completely different way to existing drugs, a group of British, German and Polish scientists have revealed in a paper recently published in the journal Nature Catalysis . This suggests a new route could be exploited to tackle bacterial disease, they say. \u201cWe could not elicit any resistance towards albicidin in the laboratory,\u201d said Dmitry Ghilarov, whose research group is based at the John Innes Centre in Norwich. \u201cThat is why we are really excited \u2013 because we think it will be very hard for bacteria to evolve resistance against albicidin-derived antibiotics.\u201d Albicidin is produced by a bacterial plant pathogen called Xanthomonas albilineans that triggers a devastating disease, known as leaf scald, in sugarcane. The pathogen uses albicidin to attack the plant, but it was also found, several decades ago, that it was highly effective at killing bacteria. \u201cThe problem was that, at the time, we did not know exactly how albicidin attacked bacteria and so we could not use it as the basis of new antibiotics because these might have triggered all sorts of complications in the human body,\u201d said Ghilarov. \u201cWe had to determine precisely how it killed bacteria before we could do that \u2013 and that is what we have now achieved.\u201d Working with scientists at the Technische Universit\u00e4t Berlin in Germany and at Jagiellonian University in Krak\u00f3w, Poland, Ghilarov and his team used a series of advanced techniques to reveal how albicidin kills. \u201cNow we have a structural understanding, we can create modifications of albicidin to improve its efficacy and pharmacological properties,\u201d said Ghilarov. \u201cWe believe this is one of the most exciting new antibiotic candidates in many years. It has extremely high effectiveness in small concentrations and is highly potent against pathogenic bacteria \u2013 even those resistant to the widely used antibiotics such as fluoroquinolones.\u201d The World Health Organization has warned that antibiotic resistance has become one of the biggest threats to global health, food security and development. The indiscriminate overuse of antibiotics has caused bacteria to develop resistance to them, resulting in the evolution of some strains of microbes that have become much harder to eliminate, which in turn has led to higher medical costs, prolonged hospital stays and increased mortality. One recent study suggested that this problem is now killing about 3,500 people every day, with more than 1.2 million dying in 2019 as a direct result of antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections. \u201cOne problem is that there is simply not enough research and development into new antibiotics by pharmaceutical companies,\u201d said Prof Tony Maxwell, who is also based at the John Innes Centre. \u201cNew compounds used to come on the market all the time but that is no longer the case. Fewer and fewer big pharma companies are working on antibiotics and so fewer and fewer are being approved by western drug authorities. The problem is that you don\u2019t make money out of antibiotics any more.

GM bacteria could combat antibiotic resistance, study suggests Read more \u201cOn the other hand, there is nothing better for treating a bacterial disease than an antibiotic, so this work, which opens up a whole new range of drugs based on our new understanding of how albicidin works, has got to be good news. It may take years to create clinically effective versions but it does suggest we may have a new weapon in our armoury one day.\u201d This point was backed by Ghilarov. \u201cTo get things moving, the government needs to step in, as it did with vaccine development. It needs to provide incentives or set up a dedicated antibiotic development institute.\u201d",

    "content": "In a recent paper submitted in November 2022, a scientist at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne quantifies how the Earth has not heard a radio signal from an extraterrestrial technological civilization over the course of approximately the last 60 years, which is when the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) began listening for such signals. They also quantify the potential likelihood pertaining to when we might hear a signal, along with recommending potential strategies that could aid in the ongoing search for detecting a signal from an extraterrestrial technological civilization. \u201cOne interesting result of this study is that it bridges the gap between two popular but opposing views,\u201d Dr. Claudio Grimaldi, who is a guest scientist in the Laboratory of Statistical Biophysics at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne, and sole author of the study, recently told Universe Today . \u201cOne insists that technoemissions pervade our galaxy and that, persevering in the search, we will eventually find them, while the other argues that extraterrestrial technological life is so rare that can be considered practically nonexistent. \u201cPersonally, if I had to choose, I would prefer the first option to the second. However, there could be a third, less extreme possibility that should be considered if we want to get a more complete picture. That is, since we began searching only about 60 years ago without success, then it is possible that Earth has not been illuminated by technosignals since then, even though other regions of the galaxy may have been. In other words, it could be that for at least 60 years the Earth has been inside a sort of \u2018silent bubble\u2019.\u201d Remove All Ads on Universe Today Join our Patreon for as little as $3! Get the ad-free experience for life Dr. Grimaldi\u2019s results provide statistical assessments on when a radio signal might pass by the Earth, which he refers to as a \u201ccrossing event\u201d, noting a 95% probability the next crossing event will not occur longer than 100,000 years, 50% probability of a crossing event occurring between no less than 60 to 1,800 years, and 20% probability of a crossing event occurring no sooner than 240 years. \u201cIn the \u2018silent bubble\u2019 scenario, the waiting time of no less than 60 years is very optimistic,\u201d Dr. Grimaldi recently told Universe Today . \u201cMoreover, even after this time span, the fact that the Earth may be illuminated by technological signals is a necessary but not sufficient condition for their detection since they may be missed by our telescopes. Thus, even in the optimistic 60-year time window for a crossing event, the waiting time until detection could be much longer.\u201d Given the study\u2019s results provide a wide range of probabilities for detecting a technosignature in the future, and since the study focuses solely on technosignature searches conducted by SETI, what steps can be taken if we were to \u201crethink current search strategies\u201d, as noted in the paper, regarding how SETI conducts its searches? \u201cIf it is true that it could be several years, if not centuries, before a technosignal is potentially detectable, then it may be better to focus on commensal SETI investigations, i.e., searching for technosignals from data collected by telescopes performing other observational activities, rather than investing resources and telescope time in active SETI searches,\u201d Dr. Grimaldi recently told Universe Today . For now, the closest we\u2019ve come to detecting a technosignature from an extraterrestrial technological civilization still remains the famous Wow! Signal , which was a very loud, but very quick, radio signal detected by the Big Ear radio telescope at Ohio State University in 1977. Until we detect something similar, or maybe better, we continue to listen to the heavens with patient ears, hoping someone else is out there waiting to be heard. \u201cI like to think that we are not alone, in the sense that other life forms, not necessarily advanced, could populate the universe,\u201d Dr. Grimaldi recently told Universe Today . \u201cComplex or even technological life may be much rarer than was thought decades ago, but its existence is not precluded by the physical laws we know. To the question of whether we will ever be able to detect them, I have no answer.\u201d As always, keep doing science & keep looking up!",

For the fourth-seeded Djokovic, it\u2019s also a chance to win his 10th Australian Open title a year after he wasn\u2019t allowed to compete at Melbourne Park because he was not vaccinated for COVID-19. It would also be the 35-year-old Serbian player\u2019s 22nd Grand Slam singles title, tying him with Rafael Nadal for the men's record. The third-seeded Tsitsipas is trying to become the first Greek player to win a Grand Slam singles title. In his only other major final, Tsitsipas won the first two sets against Djokovic but lost the match in five. ___ AP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",

    "description": "He doesn't mention Santos' name once as he's blistered over hypocritical treatment of the Republican serial liar on \"Face the Nation.\"",
    "content": "New Speaker of the House Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) on Sunday completely ignored questions about serial Republican liar Rep. George Santos , insisting instead that the real problem is a \u201cbroken\u201d Congress. Santos has been appointed to two House committees, even though the Long Island lawmaker has blatantly lied about his heritage, his family, his education, his resume \u2014 and apparently campaign financing . The Justice Department has signaled that it has already launched a criminal investigation into his funding, The Washington Post reported last week. Advertisement McCarthy just bounced Democratic Reps. Adam Schiff and Eric Swalwell of California off the House Intelligence Committee because he said that their level of \u201cgenuine honesty\u201d and \u201cintegrity\u201d were unacceptable . CBS News host Margaret Brennan asked McCarthy on \u201cFace The Nation\u201d Sunday about the wisdom of granting committee assignments to Santos given his history. \u201cYou want to bring up Santos, and let\u2019s talk about the institution itself, because I agree wholeheartedly that Congress is broken,\u201d McCarthy replied, referring to nothing Brennan had said about Congress. \u201cI\u2019m asking you about George Santos,\u201d Brennan clarified. \u201cBecause you could put it to a vote to try to oust him...\u201d Advertisement McCarthy fired back: \u201cYou asked me a question. I\u2019d appreciate if you let me answer ... Congress is broken based upon what has transpired in the last Congress,\u201d he added in a total non sequitur. \u201cWhat I\u2019m trying to do is open the people\u2019s house back for the people so their voice is there \u2015 so people are held accountable.\u201d A dogged Brennan pressed: \u201cIf you got a third of your caucus to vote to oust him, you could do so.\u201d \u201cI wasn\u2019t finished answering the question,\u201d McCarthy responded. \u201cWhat I\u2019m trying to do is change some of these committees, like the Intel Committee is different than any other committee...\u201d \u201cSo you\u2019re just not going to answer the question I asked?\u201d Brennan interrupted. He didn\u2019t. In the latest Santos investigation, Mother Jones magazine reported that it was unable to confirm the existence of at least a dozen contributors listed on his campaign finance records as donating significant amounts of money to his last race in 2020. Brennan also scorched McCarthy\u2019s call to put Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) on a new subcommittee to investigate the origins of COVID-19, even though she has pushed twisted COVID conspiracy theories and compared mask requirements to help prevent the spread of a deadly pandemic to the Nazi treatment of Jews. Watch Brennan hold McCarthy\u2019s feet to the flames on \u201cFace the Nation\u201d below. McCarthy ducks all questions on Santos beginning at 13:12.

    "content": "Steve Kuhl, CEO of the Ice Dam Company, says his workers have been busier than ever this winter season. A combination of heavy snow and fluctuating temperatures has created the perfect combination to create ice dams, he says. \"This has turned into quite a season, something that I haven't seen in at least a decade,\" Kuhl said. \"There have been days where our phone just does not stop ringing. We are not able to service everyone, that's for sure. So far, we've done over 600 projects this year.\" Ice dams can create long-term headaches for homeowners. They can lead to flooding, mold and more. Kuhl says companies looking to cash in on profit have started to offer ice dam removal services despite not having the proper tools or know-how. In other situations, he says he suspects other companies have done jobs deliberately slow to milk customers for extra money. Kuhl says this could lead to jobs costing more than four times what they should. \"People are taking advantage, to be quite honest, they're taking advantage of the situation because this is an emergency,\" he said. \"Homeowners call us, sometimes in tears, because they've got water pouring in their ceilings. Some contractors recognize for the hourly rate you can bill for this work; it's a great way to make extra money.\" Kuhl says a reputable company will use steamer tools, not pressure washers, to chunk out ice dams rather than melt them fully. He also says they'll work in teams of two. \"(These companies) are not professional roofers,\" he said. \"Oftentimes, they'll pick up a machine -- oftentimes a pressure washer -- then they'll create a web page and call themselves an ice dam removal company.\" Kuhl says his company website offers lists of what to look out for, as well as other ice dam remediation tricks. \"It makes me upset,\" he said, \"because I know people are getting ripped off.\" Born and raised in Metro Detroit, Adam loves all things Michigan, but is thrilled to now call Minnesota home.",

    "content": "SALT LAKE CITY \u2014 The same day the University of Utah honored the best women\u2019s basketball coaches and players in its nearly 50-year history, Alissa Pili made yet another propositon that she might eventually be added to the list. Pili, the team\u2019s leading scorer and rebounder, made the game-tying 3-pointer and then drove the lane for the winning layup in the final seconds as the Utes outlasted UCLA 71-69 in a battle of nationally ranked Pac-12 teams at the Jon M. Huntsman Center on Sunday. Pili scored 23 points and had nine rebounds as the ninth-ranked Utes celebrated \u201cAlumni Night\u201d and improved to 18-2 overall. They also moved to 8-2 in league play, good enough for sole possession of second place with eight games remaining. Utah trailed for much of the game, but ended on a 7-0 run to send the nearly 4,000 fans home happy. Issy Palmer added 14 points and five assists for the Utes, while Dasia Young chipped in 11 off the bench. The win was Utah\u2019s third straight and marked the fifth time already the Utes have grabbed a league win in a contest that could have gone either way. \u201cWhat a crazy game,\u201d Utah coach Lynne Roberts said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like we woke up and started playing with the intensity needed to beat UCLA. Everything was hard. It was like we kind of had square wheels.\u201d Utah Utes forward Alissa Pili (35) shoots a 3-pointer that tied the game during an NCAA women\u2019s basketball game at the Huntsman Center in Salt Lake City on Sunday, Jan. 29, 2023.

Ryan Sun, Deseret News Emily Bessoir scored a career-high 17 points, which included five 3-pointers, to lead UCLA (17-5, 6-4), but the Bruins lost their second straight one-possession game, having fell to Colorado 73-70 in overtime Friday. \u201cWe still have some mental errors we got to take care of,\u201d UCLA coach Cori Chase said. \u201cYou can\u2019t give away possessions and win at the highest levels.\u201d Chase, however, might have been guilty of her own mental error. The Bruins\u2019 defense had frustrated Utah all afternoon, holding three of their primary 3-point shooters (Gianna Kneepkens, Kennady McQueen and Jenna Johnson) to a combined 1 of 11 from beyond the arc. The only reason the Utes stayed close was due to the hustle and momentum created by Palmer and Young, as well as freshman Teya Sidberry. UCLA led 69-64 on a pair of free throws by Charity Osborne with 1:58 left, but Kneepkens came downcourt and made two charity shots, McQueen then stole the ball and both coaches decided to roll the dice with their players on the court, rather than call a timeout to discuss strategy. \u201cWhen you recruit good players, you have them go out and play,\u201d Roberts said. The 6-foot-2 Pili had been bothered all game by UCLA\u2019s physical play underneath, so she came to the perimeter, welcomed a pass from Kneepkens, faced the basket and connected on her only 3-point attempt of the game. CLUTCH That's it. That's the tweet. @alissa_pili #GoUtes \ud83d\udcfa Pac-12 Network \ud83d\udcf1 https://t.co/9JjYT1TdOd pic.twitter.com/0kr3d2k7e3 UCLA took a quick timeout with 33 seconds left and, instead of waiting for the last shot, drew up a play, and the 5-foot-11 Gabriela Jacquez took the ball to the basket at Palmer, who was probably the smallest player on the court (5-foot-9). \u201cI just remembered how I used to play (defense) against my brother and my dad,\u201d Palmer said. Jacquez\u2019s shot missed and Palmer rebounded as the crowd erupted. The arena got even louder 20 seconds later, when Pili took a pass from Young and was again decorated as the game\u2019s hero with a driving layup. ALISSA PILI LADIES AND GENTLEMEN #GoUtes \ud83d\udcfa Pac-12 Network \ud83d\udcf1 https://t.co/9JjYT1TdOd pic.twitter.com/36yVxiB5a9 Pili has already earned quite a few team MVP awards in her first season since transferring from Southern Cal. She had to be gratified even further after the Utes defeated her former team, and then edged her former rival in successive games. \u201cI knew they would be playing me close after I hit that 3-pointer,\u201d Pili said, \u201cso I just drove around her and got to the basket.\u201d Roberts again noted that it was a team-oriented win. While the Utes shot just 38% from the field, and made only 7 of 26 3-pointers, they were 18 of 19 from the free-throw line. The win was also their second straight over UCLA, a welcomed feat after they had dropped 18 straight going back to 2009. \u201cWe\u2019ve come a long way, and we\u2019re not finished yet,\u201d Roberts said.",

    "content": "NEW YORK -- A deadly fire in the Bronx on Sunday afternoon is now being described by firefighters as suspicious. One person was killed and at least two others were injured in the blaze in the Soundview section of the borough. The FDNY says more than 100 firefighters rushed to the building at Evergreen and Westchester avenues at around 2 p.m. \"It was crazy, man,\" tenant Ibrahima Magassouba said. Magassouba says when heard people running through the building, he opened his door. \"I don't know how to feel. Like, a lotta smoke coming, man. I just panicked. I left everything inside. I had to come out running,\" Magassouba said. Once he got out, he says he saw one of his neighbors waving for help from a first-floor window. That neighbor told CBS2 she broke a window to escape. She suffered some cuts but is expected to be okay. \"It was really big. Those are my neighbors. They almost died,\" Magassouba said. Deputy Chief James Donlevy said the FDNY considers the fire suspicious and the fire marshal is investigating. \"Really because of the heavy fire on arrival, and we can't determine any obvious cause at this time,\" Donlevy said. As for Magassouba and the other people who escaped, they're working with Red Cross to figure out where they'll stay Sunday night. Tim McNicholas is a reporter for CBS New York. He joined the team in September 2022 after working in Chicago, Indianapolis, Toledo and Hastings, Nebraska.",

Thriller Netflix Lockwood and Co. (2023\u2014) A young adult book adaptation done well. Jonathan Stroud's supernatural thriller series comes to life thanks to the accomplished hand of Joe Cornish, who wrote and directed sci-fi gem Attack the Block. A trio of talented teenage ghost hunters operate a detective agency in a dangerous London populated with horrors of the night. Charming and witty, this bingeable series is best served with a cup of tea and a blanket. Netflix Lupin (2021\u2014) If you enjoyed Money Heist, then meet Lupin, another non-English language show with an action-packed story. This time we're in France, where professional thief Assane Diop enacts his revenge mission on the man responsible for his father's death. Inspired by a book about gentleman thief Ars\u00e8ne Lupin, Assane uses disguises, thieving know-how and a good dose of charisma to expose the wealthy and powerful Hubert Pellegrini's crimes. Netflix Bodyguard (2018) Bodyguard broke records when it first aired in Britain, climbing from cliffhanger to cliffhanger at a relentless pace. This might be the definition of the unstoppable binge, not surprising given it comes from the mind of Line of Duty's Jed Mercurio. Game of Thrones' Richard Madden plays the titular bodyguard, who suffers from PTSD after serving in the Afghanistan war. On top of that, he's assigned to protect the Home Secretary (Keeley Hawes), whose politics he despises. Taking provocative turns, and crafting one of the best-ever 20-minute opening scenes , Bodyguard is an expert tension-building balancing act. Netflix House of Cards (2013-2018) While Kevin Spacey's sexual harassment allegations ended up marring this slick, fourth-wall breaking slice of politics' dark side, it's still worth watching if you dig power games and the occasional backstabbing. Initially following Spacey's Frank Underwood, House of Cards' sixth and final season pivots to follow his wife Claire (Robin Wright) as she takes on more and more power in the Oval Office. Crime Netflix Unbelievable (2019) This miniseries, based on a true story of rape, deftly navigates its disturbing and tricky subject matter with the help of a remarkable performance from Kaitlyn Dever. She plays Marie, a teenager who's charged with lying about being raped, but of course it's more complicated than that. Toni Collette and Merritt Wever team up as whip-smart detectives who see what others fail to, adding another layer to Unbelievable's delicate, powerfully moving triumph. Netflix When They See Us (2019) Ava DuVernay's When They See Us comes under the tough but essential viewing banner. It depicts the real-life events of the 1989 Central Park jogger case, involving five male suspects of color who were falsely accused of rape and assault. Not only sensitively drawing the humanity of the boys into focus, When They See Us demands outrage at the injustice of systemic racism. Netflix The Sinner (2017-2021) Four fascinating seasons of The Sinner await to be cracked open, each one focused on a murder committed by an unlikely offender in even stranger circumstances. Season 1 follows Jessica Biel's Cora, who stabs a man to death on a beach in a sudden frenzy, but has no idea why. It's up to Bill Pullman's Detective Ambrose to unravel the shockingly disturbing events embedded in her psyche that lead to her being triggered. Netflix Money Heist (2017-2021) This series is loved by many ( and Netflix loves you for it ), but in case you haven't heard what all the fuss is about, Money Heist is, yep, about a heist. The mastermind doing Ocean's Eleven-level prep work with equally satisfying reveals is The Professor. He's got banks in his sights and we see how his intricate plans come together with slick flashbacks, time-jumps and even an unreliable narrator. This is captivating TV with a distinct Spanish identity -- don't let the subtitles put you off. Netflix American Vandal (2017-2018) The first two seasons of this mockumentary series burst onto Netflix with a potent combination of potty humor and social commentary. A parody of true crime documentaries such as Netflix's own Making a Murderer, American Vandal follows the aftermath of a high school prank gone wrong. After 27 faculty cars are left fatally vandalized with grievous phallic images, it's up to a couple of sophomores to crack the crime, before the wrong person is expelled for good. Yep, this is a satire. But it weaves a surprisingly engrossing mystery that creates an accurate bigger picture of contemporary high school life. A hefty achievement. Netflix Alias Grace (2017) This miniseries is from a couple of years ago, but in case you missed it, it's definitely worth checking out. In the vein of The Sinner, Alias Grace steps back into its young female protagonist's past to figure out why she commits murder, of which she has no memory. An adaptation of a Margaret Atwood novel, the show stars a hypnotic Sarah Gadon as Irish immigrant Grace, navigating a turbulent life as a servant for a family in colonial Toronto. Partly based on a true story, this isn't a straightforward mystery with straightforward answers and that's what makes it all the more captivating. Netflix Mindhunter (2017-2019) David Fincher directs a stash of episodes in this psychological crime thriller's two-season run ( the third is on indefinite hold ), so meticulous visuals and captivating storylines are a given. Holden Ford (Jonathan Groff) is a special agent in the FBI, sent to interview serial killers in prison to build a profile of what makes them tick. Cameron Britton as real-life serial killer Ed Kemper is absolutely chilling. Mindhunter is smarter and richer than your average crime show, somehow growing with its complex characters. It would be a shame if the third season didn't happen ( although that seems to be the case ). Netflix Narcos (2015-2017) Drug kingpin Pablo Escobar is the subject of this, yes, addictive series that races through his rise to becoming the infamous cocaine distributor and billionaire. A true-to-life account that blends in archival footage, Narcos manages to present a sympathetic side to Escobar without undermining the gravity of its material. Plus, the DEA's hunt to bring Escobar down ratchets up the suspense. After you finish the three series, head to Narcos: Mexico, a companion series that focuses on the illegal drug trade in Mexico. Netflix Peaky Blinders (2013-2022) Netflix wisely snapped up the rights to Peaky Blinders and there are six seasons (and eventually a spinoff film) to traverse the stunning rise of 1900s Birmingham gang leader Thomas Shelby. Prepare yourself for a mesmerizing performance from Cillian Murphy in this family saga that has a fantastic amount of fun and flair showing Shelby's dealings with other gangs, the police and the occasional lover. Romance Netflix Heartstopper (2022\u2014) If you're in the market for an impeccable new happy place to move into, look no further. Heartstopper is a bright spark of a coming-of-age series, telling an LGBTQ+ love story with compassion and grace (and no one dies). Charlie falls in love with Nick, but Nick is still figuring out his sexuality. With real teenagers playing teenagers, fleshed out characters and little animations that evoke Alice Oseman's graphic novel of the same name, Heartstopper is a safe, joyous, life-affirming queer romance. Essential viewing. Netflix Bridgerton (2020\u2014) Known as Jane Austen but with sex, this period piece offers a different take on the early 19th century dating scene. With lavish production designs and colorful costumes, this is Regency London like you've rarely seen it. The Bridgerton siblings' adventures in love are captured by a scandalous newsletter, written by Regency London's version of Gossip Girl, voiced by none other than Julie Andrews. Settle in for this gorge-worthy viewing. Netflix Love (2016-2018) This Judd Apatow creation draws the best out of the talented Gillian Jacobs (Britta in Community) and Paul Rust. They play Mickey and Gus respectively, an opposites-attract couple, who go to messy, frustrating and endearingly down-to-earth places that make this an honest look at a relationship being built over time. Iris Apatow is a standout as the unhappy child actress Gus tutors who gets away with just about anything. Netflix Lovesick (2014-2018) Easy, enjoyable viewing with a premise ripe for embarrassment humor. Helpless-in-love Dylan discovers he has chlamydia and must track down past flings and inform them they might have it too. A flashback narrative keeps us on our toes, especially when the focus turns to Dylan and best friend Evie's feelings for each other. It never goes into soapy territory, with an eccentric but loveable supporting cast playing English flatmates in a Glasgow setting. Comedy Netflix The Chair (2021) A comedy-drama starring Sandra Oh? The Chair is elevated by Oh's impeccable charm. Set at the fictional Pembroke University, The Chair follows Oh's Professor Ji-Yoon Kim, the newly appointed chair of the English department. She's the first woman chosen for the position and faces an uphill battle to move the stale department along with the changing times. With astute observations about academia, scene-stealing appearances by Holland Taylor as a senior faculty member, and ambitious social commentary, The Chair reaches worthy heights. Netflix Never Have I Ever (2020\u2014) Devi is your average high schooler who wants nothing more than to be cool and get a boyfriend. But it's hard to stay chipper after your dad dies. Mindy Kaling's coming-of-age story covers familiar territory and yet it stands out from the pack in multiple ways. Get this: Its narrator is John McEnroe . The sporting connection is just one layer of this surprising, charm-your-socks-off show, depicting an Indian family living in California. You've seen these stories before, but not with these unique characters. Netflix Julie and the Phantoms (2020) Stick with Julie and the Phantoms' silly premise before making any judgements. Julie is a teenager who accidentally summons a boy band from the '90s -- The Phantoms. While Julie helps the band achieve their potential, they help her enjoy music and life again after the death of her mother. As music tends to do, the catchy tunes will send you soaring through the joyous, ridiculously entertaining and, of course, romance-filled first season. Ghost jokes are included. Netflix Feel Good (2020-2021) Comedian Mae Martin's Feel Good really does try to do what it says on the tin. It follows the repressed George (Charlotte Ritchie) as she falls for Martin's Mae after seeing her stand-up show. Their London-based romance sees George grappling with coming out to her middle-class friends and family, while Canadian Mae has a drug problem that makes their love even more difficult. A confidently told story with its sense of humor nailed on from the start, Feel Good exudes sweetness and grace. Sam Taylor/Netflix Sex Education (2019\u2014) Binging Sex Education is a no-brainer: The self-aware, John Hughes-possessed mishmash of American and British high school culture is a joyful breeze to watch. We follow Otis (Asa Butterfield), the son of a sex therapist (Gillian Anderson), as he embarks on his sexual awakening. The explicit sex talk and scenes are addressed in refreshingly healthy and honest ways. Built around a diverse cast with pure charisma, the show gets even bigger in season 3. Netflix Russian Doll (2019\u2014) Russian Doll takes its Groundhog Day premise and wrenches it apart in the most unpredictable ways. Natasha Lyonne is the crackling spark at the center of its time-looping mystery, playing Nadia, a game developer who repeatedly dies on the night of her 36th birthday party. The Amy Poehler co-created show uses time travel to explore self-reflection on a whole new level, making this a definite one-sitting appointment. Guy D'Alema/Netflix Cobra Kai (2018\u2014) Initially Cobra Kai, a series based on the Karate Kid films, might sound like a cynical money-making spinoff of the martial arts franchise. But it's become one of Netflix's most popular shows, thanks to well-written characters and a good measure of nostalgia. The series follows Johnny Lawrence, 34 years after he was jump-kicked in the face by Daniel LaRusso. Taking this subversive viewpoint, Cobra Kai is four seasons of self-aware, light-hearted and full-of-heart fun. Netflix Derry Girls (2018-2022) Another unmissable show, Derry Girls follows the mishaps of Erin and her friends in 1990s Derry, Ireland. Their teenage woes are paired with antics from their equally hilarious parents, set on a backdrop of the Northern Ireland conflict. While you can make comparisons with The Inbetweeners, Derry Girls draws from its own well of sweet charm and the historical context paves ground for surprisingly dark humor. Michele K Short/Netflix Maniac (2018) This dark comedy miniseries stars Emma Stone and Jonah Hill as two strangers, Annie and Owen, who sign up for a mysterious pharmaceutical trial (because that's a good idea) that induces wild, often distressing dreams. Entrenched in dazzlingly crafted visuals, Maniac is a multilayered dive into the subconscious. Which means it's dark and unpredictable, with a surprising touch of the warm sentimental stuff. Netflix GLOW (2017-2019) A show inspired by the true story of the first pro female wrestling syndicate in the '80s? Starring Alison Brie? Produced by Jenji Kohan? Dreams do come true. GLOW's purely fun comedy, packed with eccentric female characters, teams campiness with underdog triumph and soars. Season 3 progresses deeper into the lives of its diverse ensemble, shifting the series to Las Vegas. A fourth and final season was in the works, but sadly production fell victim to the pandemic and Netflix canceled the show . Netflix Dear White People (2017-2021) This provocatively titled show delivers a timely look at modern race relations through the eyes of a different character each episode. Following several Black students at Winchester, an Ivy League institution, Dear White People manages to blend its social commentary with a sharp sense of humor. With its fourth and final season now in the books, this remains a powerful eye-opener. Netflix The End of The F***ing World (2017-2019) If you like your dark British humor, look no further than The End of The F***ing World. Psychopath James (Alex Lawther) comes up with a plan to kill Alyssa (Jessica Barden) while on the run from their lousy parents. But as they soar across the open road and commit a couple of violent crimes, their callous hearts soften and they develop feelings for one another. Surprising, fast-paced and surreal, both seasons of this deadpan teenager of a show, with its headphones pumping the best sad '50s, '60s and '70s doo-wop , will blow you away. Netflix Crashing (2016) Before she electrified everyone with the word-for-word perfect Fleabag, Phoebe Waller-Bridge wrote a six-part comedy that showcased the early stages of her astonishing talent. Crashing follows six twenty-somethings living in a disused hospital, casually observing the strict rules in exchange for cheap rent. The oddball characters subvert expectations wherever hilariously possible, with Waller-Bridge dropping in as the ukulele-playing Lulu. Not only disrupting the Friends setup, she gets herself into occasionally jaw-droppingly dark situations ( see the all-too-touchy Aunt Gladys ). Netflix Master of None (2015-2021) On the surface a comedy about a 30-year-old New Yorker who loves his pasta, Master of None casually throws in nuanced and moving episodes about immigrant families and their second-generation children. Then it drops an entire episode about Tinder. Dev's relatable experiences bubble with creator and star Aziz Ansari's wit and charm and, personal controversy aside, the romantic and cultural themes he explores are remarkably mature. Season 3 takes things down a different road again, starring Lena Waithe and Naomi Ackie. Ansari features in an episode, letting us know where Dev's at in his love life. Netflix Call My Agent! (2015-2020) Thinking about dipping your toe into more of Netflix's international content? French comedy Call My Agent! hosts an ever-growing list of famous actors playing themselves, from French stars to Americans like Sigourney Weaver (!) in the latter seasons. But we look at the world of showbiz from the perspective of the long-suffering agents, including Camille Cottin's scene stealing powerhouse agent Andr\u00e9a Martel, who rebuffs male colleagues with lines like: \"When I moved on from guys to girls, it was like graduating from the sandpit to the football pitch.\" A brilliant series with four seasons poking fun at the entertainment industry (a fifth season and a TV film are on their way). Netflix BoJack Horseman (2014-2020) When it comes to cartoons that lower your guard before gut-punching you with reflections on mental health, BoJack Horseman takes the cake. Set in an LA filled with anthropomorphic animals, it follows a washed-up ex-sitcom star who tries to climb back to his former celebrity by releasing an autobiography. While at first it might take you some time to digest this unconventional cocktail, BoJack Horseman soon astounds you with its truths about struggling with depression and addiction on the path to getting your life back on track. Sci-fi Netflix Archive 81 (2022) Enjoy sci-fi series that play with two timelines? Have a special spot for cults and mysteries? Meet Archive 81. The multiple genre-straddling show stars Mamoudou Athie as Dan Turner, an archivist who takes a gig restoring a collection of damaged videotapes from the '90s. He gets far more than he bargained for, drawn into an investigation of a mysterious cult and a young woman who may or may not be dead. A supernatural thriller with horror, mystery, noir and sci-fi seeped into its creepy atmosphere, Archive 81 has it all. Netflix Dark (2017-2020) Germany's answer to Stranger Things deliberately takes its time before stepping into completely compelling and original places. A sci-fi noir, Dark folds time travel, conspiracies and estranged families into a generation-spanning story kicked off by a child's disappearance. If those kinds of meticulously-crafted layers are what you're after in your storytelling, settle in. All three seasons of Dark's meditative look at time travel and its effect on human nature are waiting to hit you at full force. Netflix Stranger Things (2016\u2014) It wouldn't be a best list without Stranger Things. If somehow you've missed the Duffer Brothers' ode to '80s horror and Steven Spielberg, things are about to get tubular. We follow El, a near-mute girl who was the subject of scientific experiments. She develops telekinetic powers, which she uses to fend off monsters who invade from a frightening alternative dimension. The world of Indiana, Hawkins, is lovingly detailed for anyone in need of an '80s nostalgia hit and the misfit characters, played by a stellar young cast, are part of everything that makes this show a tour de force. Netflix Travelers (2016-2018) Full disclosure: Netflix sadly canceled Travelers after its third season, but this tightly plotted sci-fi out of Canada does manage to end with an ambitious bang. We start with Marcy, a disabled woman who's beaten up after helping a friend escape thugs. She dies -- then comes back to life. This strong character-driven sci-fi reveals its secrets in clever ways, following operatives from the future tasked with preventing the collapse of society but also navigating the tricky territory of living a double life. Laurie Sparham/Netflix Black Mirror (2011\u2014) While Charlie Brooker's bleak tech anthology series can be hit and miss , at its best, Black Mirror packs its mini-movies with an exploration of futuristic technological ideas through painfully human stories. One of those is San Junipero, following two women in the '80s (cue banging soundtrack) as they fall for each other in ways they couldn't do in their \"real\" lives outside the beach city. The tech aspect is revealed with genius timing and, in general, the show explores the consequences of our plugged-in lives in disturbing and occasionally uplifting ways. Fantasy Parisa Tag/Netflix The Bastard Son & The Devil Himself (2022\u2014) Talk about having the world against you as a teenager. The Bastard Son & The Devil Himself follows 16-year-old Nathan Byrne, a young witch whose father is the most dangerous \"blood witch\" alive. For his whole life, Nathan has been monitored by a council of witches who fear he'll turn out like ol' pops. Featuring a modern day witch hunt and plenty of self-realization, this British fantasy is at the top of its genre and surprisingly beautiful amid the bouts of blood. Netflix Arcane (2021\u2014) One of the best TV shows of 2021 was an animated series. That's right -- if you're animation-unfriendly, Arcane is the show to change your mind. The action-adventure introduces us to the steampunk world of Piltover and Zaun, two cities grinding on opposing values and fortunes. Then there's Violet (Hailee Steinfeld) and Jinx (Ella Purnell), two sisters torn apart by tragedy and fighting to survive. Arcane is the kind of moving portrait that gets under your skin on a par with Pixar. The characters will draw you to tears. A must-watch. Netflix Sweet Tooth (2021\u2014) This fantasy based on Jeff Lemire's comic book is the definition of weird and wonderful. Sweet Tooth follows Gus (a stellar Christian Convery), a half-deer half-human child, who lives a sheltered life in the forest with his dad Pubba (Will Forte). Events relating to The Great Crumble, a viral pandemic, sweep Gus into an adventure branching down mysterious, action-filled and highly entertaining paths. Echoes with real-world struggles can be heard in the treetops of this immersive, riveting fantasy world. Genre fans settle in for this fantastic ride. Kevin Baker / Netflix The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance (2019) We weren't ready for The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance. Canceled after one season, the critically acclaimed fantasy series is, well, a gem. A prequel to the 1982 Jim Henson film, the series returns to the planet Thra, where three Gelflings inspire a rebellion against the absolutely diabolic Skeksis. The puppet design and performances -- from a stunning cast including Taron Edgerton, Anya Taylor-Joy and Nathalie Emmanuel -- sneak up on you. You'll find yourself deeply invested in the poor, oppressed Gelflings' lives, hurt just as much as the puppets whenever one of their own is harmed. A full-on fantasy epic, built with love, care and staggering detail. Horror Ken Woroner/Netflix Guillermo del Toro's Cabinet of Curiosities (2022) Not every chapter of this horror anthology leaps out with claws bared, but the best of the bunch unfurl delightful gothic flourishes. Guillermo del Toro introduces each of the episodes of the series, co-writing the two best -- Lot 36 and The Murmuring. The eight episodes harness the talents of different directors, bringing their own take to the horror realm. Netflix Midnight Mass (2021) From the auteur who brought us The Haunting of Hill House and Bly Manor, comes another slow-burning horror series that'll haunt you for days. Midnight Mass is Mike Flanagan's latest creation, a meticulously crafted mystery spanning seven hourlong episodes. Riley Flynn, still paying the price for a drunk driving accident four years ago, returns home to Crockett Island, where the arrival of a charismatic new priest coincides with astonishing miracles around the town. Pregnant with a sense of foreboding and dread, Midnight Mass is an eloquent interrogation of faith, with horrifying supernatural monsters along for the ride. Steve Dietl/Netflix The Haunting of Hill House (2018) Mike Flanagan's The Haunting of Hill House, loosely based on Shirley Jackson's novel of the same name, weaves its horror into a deeply affecting story about a broken family. Fractured after growing up in a haunted house, the Crains can't ignore their past and must do what you never want to do: Go back down those dark corridors. The impressive set-pieces will please horror fans, but it's the sad story of the Crains that will, yes, haunt you for days. Good news: The second chapter of the anthology, The Haunting of Bly Manor, is a similarly affecting Gothic romance. Netflix Crazyhead (2016) If you were a fan of Howard Overman's insanely entertaining Misfits, Crazyhead might be where you want to head next. Overman's follow-up show, which first aired in the UK in 2016, is a comedy-horror starring Cara Theobold (the voice of Tracer in Overwatch) and Susan Wokoma as unlikely friends who bond over being able to see demons gallivanting about in normal society. Their brilliant double-act is at the heart of this disturbingly entertaining series, featuring exorcisms, accidental roommate killings and demon fathers. Yeah, you need to watch this for yourself. Drama Netflix Extraordinary Attorney Woo (2022\u2014) Extraordinary Attorney Woo is a runaway winner. Its unique concept: A woman who has autism becomes a lawyer in South Korea, elevated by her brilliant and unexpected ways of approaching cases. An inspiring heroine, Woo Young-woo (Park Eun-bin) brings extraordinary representation to the screen. Charming, heartwarming, as radiant as the sun -- you could watch this show for days. Mike Koll\u00f6ffel/Netflix Borgen (2010\u2014) Denmark's bleaker answer to the West Wing. Borgen is the epitome of sophisticated political dramas, chronicling the inspiring fictional underdog story of how, against all odds, Birgitte Nyborg Christensen (Sidse Babett Knudsen) becomes the first female prime minister of Denmark. Produced by the same company behind The Killing, Borgen is four influential seasons of one woman's complicated, intricate rise to power. Netflix Maid (2021) Margaret Qualley is the heart of this miniseries based on a memoir. Maid follows Alex, a young mother trying to support her daughter by working as a housecleaner. Alex's task is made slightly more difficult thanks to an abusive relationship, poverty, homelessness and more. But it's not all heavy subject matter, with light and charming moments that give Maid an extra sheen. Not only a moving story expertly crafted, Maid cements Qualley as a major star. Netflix The Queen's Gambit (2020) How do you make chess the thrilling centerpiece of a coming-of-age tale? You shake it into a cocktail of stylish visuals, a rocking '60s soundtrack and the magnetic Anya Taylor-Joy as Beth Harmon, one of the youngest (and few female) chess players in the world. The fictional story in The Queen's Gambit , named after a chess opening, follows her rise from an orphanage to toppling the best players in the world -- as long as her drug addiction and bags of wine bottles don't get in the way. Netflix Unorthodox (2020) This miniseries is based on a memoir and told primarily in Yiddish with painstaking detail. Almost a thriller, Unorthodox follows 19-year-old Esty Shapiro, who escapes her arranged marriage in an ultra-Orthodox community in Brooklyn. She ends up in Berlin, exploring a new life outside the strict beliefs she grew up in, but her community doesn't let go that easily. Featuring a stunning performance from Shira Haas, Unorthodox lets you take a step into a relentlessly compelling world. Netflix Godless (2017) This miniseries carves itself firmly into the Western genre, with a female-led cast boasting Merritt Weaver and Downton Abbey's Michelle Dockery. With its 1880s New Mexico vistas swirling around it, Godless draws up the violence in a tale that sees an outlaw on the run from his boss seek refuge with an outcast widower. Oh, Jeff Daniels is in this too, if the show wasn't enticing enough. Netflix The Crown (2016\u2014) Sumptuous is one word to describe the production values of The Crown's drama about the British monarchy. Following Queen Elizabeth II's life, starting in her 20s with a powerhouse performance from Claire Foy, The Crown captures the grand workings of historical events from deep within Buckingham Palace. Figures like Winston Churchill, Princess Margaret, Margaret Thatcher and more are treated with the highest cinematic sophistication. The fifth season was released in 2022 and a sixth season is on its way, to round out your knowledge of the queen's reign into the early 21st century.

The First Lady was in attendance for the big game at Lincoln Financial Field, where the Eagles faced off against the San Francisco 49ers ... and completely blew them out in a very lop-sided matchup.

First Lady Dr. Jill Biden and Roger Goodell are in attendance at today's NFC Championship game pic.twitter.com/QIe2OS6o4L The thrashing Philly put on for the home crowd was watched by thousands in the stands, including a handful of celebs who rolled through -- Bradley Cooper was one of the famous faces who was flapping, but DJB was by far the most prominent person in attendance. In fact, she had one of the best seats in the house ... sitting next to NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell , no less, and chatting him up during the broadcast.

There are shots of her exiting Marine One earlier Sunday in Delaware, where she was rocking an Eagles shirt under her coat. She's from NJ originally, but grew up in Willow Grove. Welp, the City of Brotherly Love didn't disappoint the most powerful woman in the country ... and, of course, the team is stoked to get their ticket to SB LVII -- set to go down Feb. 12. The only question is ... who are they gonna go up against? Joe Burrow or Pat Mahomes??The AFC Championship is about to get underway, so we'll know here soon enough.",

    "description": "These are the episodes you should watch first.",
    "content": "To a certain extent, Kaleidoscope on Netflix is a traditional heist story. It has all the regular beats: old grudges, team assembly, smaller missions that set up for the big one. But there's one key way Kaleidoscope differs from similar shows you might've seen. You can watch the episodes in any order. The series dropped Jan. 1 and made it to the No. 1 TV show on Netflix right now. Without giving too much away, Giancarlo Esposito plays Ray Vernon (aka Leo Pap), the ringleader of a group plotting a multibillion-dollar job while settling an old score. Every episode tells a chunk of the story, focusing on Vernon's motivations, or the planning of the heist, or what unfolds in the aftermath. The segments come in whichever random order Netflix decides to deliver them to you (with the exception of the actual heist serving as the final episode). This isn't the first time Netflix has experimented with nonlinear storytelling. In 2018, Black Mirror: Bandersnatch offered a choose-your-own-adventure take on a film about a computer programmer. The following year, viewers got to make decisions for adventurer Bear Grylls in You vs. Wild. Watch Kaleidoscope on Netflix See at Netflix Kaleidoscope's episodes are named for different colors, no doubt a nod to the series' name, but also a way to easily track what order you're watching and compare with friends. You aren't obligated to watch the way Netflix suggests. Here's what you need to know about how to watch Kaleidoscope. And if you've powered through and need some help sorting out what happened, here's the ending explained . Do I need to pick an order? Not necessarily. If you hit play on the show, you'll see a quick primer on how it works, and then launch straight into the episodes. They can come in any order, with the exception of White, which is the heist itself, and is structured to be the series finale. That said, if you want to pick an order for yourself, you can. How do I watch it chronologically? In the spirit of the show, I'm going to skimp on episode descriptions as not to spoil anything. If you decide to watch Kaleidoscope chronologically, the episode order goes like this, starting with a young Vernon 24 years before the heist: Violet (24 years before the heist). Green (7 years before). Yellow (6 weeks before). Orange (3 weeks before). Blue (5 days before). White (the heist). Red (the morning after). Pink (6 months after). If you decide to go this route, however, know that any big finale twists will hit in the White episode. Are there alternative ways to watch? If everyone has been doing the math correctly, seven episodes, with no repeats, that can be watched in any order should yield more than 5,000 options (there are even more options if you don't watch White last). How many of those watch orders you want to try is between you and your calendar. Netflix tweeted some order suggestions, if you're interested in watching Kaleidoscope as a Quentin Tarantino film -- ostensibly a reference to nonlinear Tarantino films like Pulp Fiction -- (Blue, Green, Yellow, Orange, Violet, Pink, White, Red) or like a classic detective story (Orange, Green, Violet, Red, Yellow, Blue, White, Pink). I came up with a bunch of different orders to watch Kaleidoscope in so you don\u2019t have to pic.twitter.com/FE6IiwjzM9 \u2014 Netflix (@netflix) January 2, 2023 window.CnetFunctions.logWithLabel('%c One Trust ', \"Service loaded: script_twitterwidget with class optanon-category-C0005\"); Came up with a few more orders to watch Kaleidoscope in so you don\u2019t have to... pic.twitter.com/83kCslkJ39 \u2014 Netflix (@netflix) January 4, 2023 window.CnetFunctions.logWithLabel('%c One Trust ', \"Service loaded: script_twitterwidget with class optanon-category-C0005\"); You could go rogue and follow the colors of the rainbow (Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Violet, Pink). Or, you could start with the big heist right off the bat, if you're feeling particularly rebellious. What are viewers suggesting on social media? Unsurprisingly, lots of folks are talking about the episode order they chose and which order is the best. Best order to watch KALEIDOSCOP series on @netflix . \ud83d\udd34 Red \u21e3 \ud83d\udfe1 Yellow \u21e3 \ud83d\udfe3 Violet \u21e3 \ud83d\udfe2 Green \u21e3 \ud83d\udd35 Blue \u21e3 \ud83d\udfe0 Orange \u21e3 \ud83d\udc97 Pink \u21e3 \u26aa\ufe0f White #kaleidoscopenetflix pic.twitter.com/Xy3iUOusRo \u2014 Puzzle Brain Kenya (@DigiNetKe) January 4, 2023 window.CnetFunctions.logWithLabel('%c One Trust ', \"Service loaded: script_twitterwidget with class optanon-category-C0005\"); KALEIDOSCOPE allowing audiences to watch episodes in any order is a brilliant & refreshing concept.

How thoughtful of you to ask. My order, as dictated by Netflix, was: Green. Yellow. Violet. Orange. Blue. Red. Pink. White. Oddly enough, my best friend's Netflix account gave her this exact order. For me, this approach got off to a strong start, but having Orange and Blue, and then Red and Pink meant two sets of episodes in chronological order, with relatively small time jumps in between. In that section, I could feel my attention waning somewhat. Watching this show chronologically feels like missing the point. If I could go back and watch in a different order, I'd bump up Red (but leave Pink where it is) and flip Yellow and Green, as I think Yellow would be the strongest episode to start. So, like this: Yellow. Green. Violet. Orange. Red. Blue. Pink. White.",

It was also a big week for Vidovic, an OK week for Malik Tillman and Alexander N\u00fcbel, and a bad week for Janina Leitzig. Check out what all of Bayern Munich \u2019s loanees did this week! France - Ligue 1 Alexander N\u00fcbel is the only player on loan in Ligue 1. Alexander N\u00fcbel - AS Monaco N\u00fcbel started and played the full 90 minutes away to Marseille. He was credited with five saves, but he was also credited with an error that led to Marseille\u2019s only goal on the night. N\u00fcbel\u2019s performance was enough to get a road draw against one of their direct competitors in the table. Monaco will host Auxerre on Wednesday and then travel to face Clermont Foot on Saturday \u2014 both in league play. Scotland - Scottish Premiership Malik Tillman is the only player on loan in the Scottish Premiership. Malik Tillman - Rangers FC After beating St Johnstone in the Scottish Cup last week, Rangers hosted them in league play. Tillman started and played 72 minutes. In his time on the field, Tillman only recorded one shot \u2014 which went wide of the goal \u2014 but he did have three key passes, creating chances for his teammates to shoot. Shortly before coming off, Tillman also received his fourth yellow card of the season for a bad foul. Rangers will travel to Edinburgh to play Hearts on Wednesday and then will host Ross County on Saturday. Netherlands - Eredivisie There is one player on loan in the Dutch Eredivisie: Gabriel Vidovic. Gabriel Vidovic \u2013 Vitesse Vidovic started in both league games last week for Vitesse. On Wednesday, Vitesse hosted FC Twente. Down 1-0 early, Vidovic equalized with a close-range shot from a tight angle. Vitesse would go on to take the lead before conceding another goal and the match ended in a 2-2 draw. On Saturday, Vitesse traveled to play SC Heerenveen. After conceding first again, Vitesse went on to win 3-1. Vidovic got the eventual winner shortly before halftime \u2014 making it two goals in as many matches! In both matches, Vidovic had 100% shot efficiency \u2014 putting five of five shots on target over the two matches. Vitesse will take on FC Emmen on the road on Saturday. Germany - 2. Bundesliga There are three players on loan in the 2. Bundesliga: Sarpreet Singh, Bright Arrey-Mbi and Jamie Lawrence. Sarpreet Singh - Jahn Regensburg After a long battle with injury in the fall and a never-ending World Cup break for the 2. Bundesliga, Sarpreet Singh finally made his season debut as a 65th minute sub. Unfortunately, he was not able to help the 10-man Regensburg as they fell 2-0 at Darmstadt. Singh will hope to get more time next week as Regensburg host Arminia Bielefeld. Bright Arrey-Mbi \u2013 Hannover 96 Arrey-Mbi was left on the bench as an unused sub in Hannover\u2019s match against 1. FC Kaiserslautern. Hannover will travel to Hamburg to play St. Pauli on Sunday. Jamie Lawrence - 1. FC Magdeburg Lawrence was not in the 18-man roster for Magdeburg\u2019s 3-2 loss away to Fortuna D\u00fcsseldorf. Magdeburg will host Karlsruher SC on Sunday. Germany - 3. Liga There are two players on loan to the 3. Liga: Marvin Cuni and Lenn Jastremski. Marvin Cuni - 1. FC Saarbr\u00fccken Saarbr\u00fccken went on the road to play SC Verl on Saturday. Already down 1-0, Cuni came into the match in the 70th minute. Unfortunately, he was not able to help his team get a result. Saarbr\u00fccken went on to lose 2-0. Saarbr\u00fccken will host Elversberg on Saturday. Lenn Jastremski - Erzgebirge Aue Jastremski was not in the 18-man squad for Aue\u2019s 0-0 draw against Freiburg II. Aue will travel to play VfL Osnabr\u00fcck on Saturday. England - Women\u2019s Super League FC Bayern Frauen have one player on loan to England\u2019s WSL. Janina Leitzig - Leicester City Leicester City WFC hosted Reading in the Women\u2019s FA Cup . Leitzig started and played 120 minutes plus penalties. The match was tied 1-1 at the end of regulation and then each team scored one in extra time. Unfortunately, Leicester fell 3-2 in penalty kicks and were eliminated from the second cup competition in as many weeks. Leicester City WFC will host Manchester City in league play on Saturday.",

    "content": "Artificial intelligence is slowly becoming a reality as more and more companies unveil their AI-based projects aimed at making human tasks automated. The release of OpenAI's ChatGPT, and the widespread response from the public has put a big spotlight on AI-based services and what they have in store for users in the future. ChatGPT is already capable of answering most questions users can throw at it while also being able to write basic programs in multiple different programming languages. Notably, ChatGPT is already being used by students as anyone with an internet connection can simply ask the AI to provide them with any form of essay on whatever question they are required to answer. However, ChatGPT is limited to text and does have its limitations. This is where other AI systems come into play. Introducing Google's MusicLM, an AI that's designed to generate high-fidelity 24 kHz music from text descriptions. According to a newly published research paper, the AI is capable of generating songs from rich text descriptions as well as sound prompts. MusicLM is claimed to create \"original\" songs from its database of sounds. The capabilities of MusicLM have already been demonstrated on Google's GitHub account , where it shows the text prompt that is given to MusicLM and the song the AI spat out based on that text description. The results are extremely impressive, but if you think MusicLM is releasing anytime soon, you are sadly wrong as the AI is still undergoing development in multiple different areas. Google has cited concerns with glitches, cultural programming biases, and plagiarism. The emergence of AI-based services that are capable of generating music from simple text prompt will definitely add fuel to the conversational fire regarding plagiarism and AI's. The main question that needs to be figured out is whether an AI's newly created song or artwork is an original piece of work. While some may argue that art/music wouldn't exist without the AI's intervention, which they say gives it its originality, others may argue that its simply plagiarism on a massive scale as the AI used potentially millions of non-consenting artists work to generate that image or song.",

    "description": "No one immediately claimed responsibility for the bombing, said a senior police official, but the Pakistani Taliban have been blamed in similar suicide attacks in the past.",
    "content": "PESHAWAR, Pakistan \u2014 A suicide bomber struck Monday inside a mosque within a police compound in the northwestern Pakistani city of Peshawar, killing at least 28 people and wounding as many as 150 worshippers, most of them policemen, officials said. The bombing drew nationwide condemnation from opposition political parties and government officials. Ghulam Ali, the provincial governor in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, where Peshawar is the capital, said there were fears the death toll could rise even further. Most of the casualties were policemen and police officers \u2014 the targeted mosque is located within a sprawling compound, which also serves as the city\u2019s police headquarters. Police said between 300 to 350 worshipers were inside the mosque when the bomber detonated his explosives. No one immediately claimed responsibility for the bombing, said Saddique Khan, a senior police official in Peshawar, but the Pakistani Taliban have been blamed in similar suicide attacks in the past. The police compound is located in a high-security zone in Peshawar, along with several government buildings, and it was unclear how the bomber managed to penetrate so deep inside the zone unnoticed. The impact of the explosion collapsed the roof of the mosque, which caved in and injured many, according to Zafar Khan, a local police officer. A survivor, 38-year-old police officer Meena Gul, said he was inside the mosque when the bomb went off. He said he doesn\u2019t know how he survived unhurt. He could hear cries and screams after the bomb exploded, Gul said. Rescuers scrambled trying to remove mounds of debris from the mosque grounds and get to worshippers still trapped under the rubble, police said. At a nearby hospital, many of the wounded were listed in critical condition as the casualty toll rose. Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif in a statement condemned the bombing, and ordered authorities to ensure the best possible medical treatment to the victims. He also vowed \u201cstern action\u201d against those who were behind the attack. Former Prime Minister Imran Khan also condemned the bombing, calling it a \u201cterrorist suicide attack\u201d in a Twitter posting. \u201cMy prayers & condolences go to victims families,\u201d said the ex-premier. \u201cIt is imperative we improve our intelligence gathering & properly equip our police forces to combat the growing threat of terrorism.\u201d Peshawar has been the scene of frequent militant attacks. The Pakistani Taliban, are known as Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan or TTP, and are separate group but also a close ally of the Afghan Taliban, who seized power in neighboring Afghanistan in August 2021 as U.S. and NATO troops were in the final stages of their pullout from the country after 20 years of war. The TTP has waged an insurgency in Pakistan over the past 15 years, fighting for stricter enforcement of Islamic laws in the country, the release of their members who are in government custody and a reduction of the Pakistani military presence in the country\u2019s former tribal regions. Pakistan has witnessed a surge in militant attacks since November when the Pakistani Taliban ended their cease-fire with government forces. The truce ended as Pakistan was still contending with last summer\u2019s unprecedented flooding that killed 1,739 people, destroyed more than 2 million homes, and at one point submerged as much as one third of the country. The flood damages totaled to more than $30 billion and authorities are now, months later, still struggling to arrange tents, shelter and food for the survivors. Cash-strapped Pakistan is currently also facing one of the worst economic crisis and is seeking a crucial installment of $1.1 billion from the International Monetary Fund \u2014 part of its $6 billion bailout package \u2014 to avoid default. Talks with the IMF on reviving the bailout have stalled in the past months. Sharif\u2019s government came to power last April after Imran Khan was ousted in a no-confidence vote in Parliament. Khan has since campaigned for early elections, claiming his ouster was illegal and part of a plot backed by the United States. Washington and Sharif have dismissed Khan\u2019s claims.

    "content": "What is EtherPOS and what are the roles of the ETPOS token? ETHERPOS is a staking network that provides technology for custodial digital currencies, global payments, and applications. The community has built a thriving digital economy, offering content creators a whole new way to make money online. EtherPOS provides a popular and secure computing platform for ETHERPOS investors by using simple and secure blockchain technology and intends to build an EtherPOS exchange. EtherPOS aims to be a leader in blockchain-based security services by providing high-quality innovative, leading-edge solutions built on a secure infrastructure and developed by leading industry practitioners and partners. EtherPOS validators are being recruited. One of the conditions for becoming a validator is to hold ETPOS tokens. Their job is to confirm new ether coins to be distributed on the network. \u201cEtherPOS has a Unique Algorithm, How Token can have a Function Like Coin\u201d ETPOS is a cryptographic token that runs on Binance Smart Chain (BSC). ETPOS is inspired by using a technical protocol similar to Ethereum. It works by selecting validators in proportion to the amount of cryptocurrency staked. The EtherPOS token (ETPOS) has passed the SOLID Proof audit, the audit address is app.solidproof.io . Token Name: EtherPoS (ETPOS) Total Supplies: 100,000 Max Supply: 100,000,000 Based Chain: BSC Trading Pair: ETPOS/USDT Trade Time: TBA Withdrawal Time: TBA What are the utilities of the ETPOS tokens? Staking Program (Validator) : The Staking Program is the main ecosystem of the ETPOS token. In particular, ETPOS token rewards are distributed to validators directly into wallets in the form of new ETPOS tokens and increase the supply of Tokens, and each individual or entity can get new ETPOS token rewards when they participate. After the contract period ends, each validator can still withdraw his ETPOS tokens when needed. NFT Card Marketplace : NFT cards are used to activate Etherpos staking contracts. NFT cards serve a variety of purposes, including determining the minimum and maximum stake amounts; the Maximum Staking Period; The number of tokens locked in the contract. EtherPOS Staking requires an NFT card, currently available in 4 versions (V20, V50n, V100, and V500) and they can be purchased on EtherPOS.io\u2019s NFT Marketplace . Burning Program : ETPOS tokens will be carried out in an open and transparent program. Burning will be carried out automatically from tokens locked in the system and reduce the total supply of tokens in the ETPOS Network.. Executive Validator (coming soon): An executive validator. Verifiers can earn commissions by inviting others to purchase NFT cards through exclusive links. Users can become validators and participate in performing validation. \u201cEtherPOS is a fully functioning web3 browser that can be used to interact with any decentralized application (Dapp)\u201d ETPOS\u2019s Tokenomics ETPOS tokens will be distributed to Validators, Partnerships, Liquidity, Teams, and Marketing to promote and develop the ecosystem.

    "content": "A researcher manning the telescope located at the top of Hawaii's tallest mountain has photographed what looks like a portal to another world. The photographs were captured on January 18 by a camera that is located at the summit of Mauna Kea, Hawaii's tallest mountain that is home to Japan's Subaru Telescope. According to reports, the camera was placed at the top of the mountain to take time-lapse footage and images of the area surrounding the Subaru telescope that can then be shared with the residents of Hawaii and the rest of the world. Ichi Tanaka, a researcher at the Subaru telescope, admitted that he wasn't the first person to spot the spiral randomly appearing in the camera's frame as he was doing other work at the time it emerged. A random stargazer that was watching the YouTube livestream of the camera's view sent him a screenshot of the spiral, which caused Tanaka to drop his jaw. \" When I opened Slack, that is what I saw, and it was a jaw-dropping event for me, \" the researcher said. Subaru Telescope So, what caused this spiral that looks like a portal? As with the majority of things that appear mystical, there is a simple answer. Researchers believe that the spiral was caused by SpaceX's recent launch that occurred the morning of January 18, the same day the images were taken. According to reports, the location of the spiral matched the location of the second stage of SpaceX's rocket at the time the photos were snapped. So what makes the spiral? It's likely the spiral is caused by a fuel dump or an exhaust plume from the rocket. Notably, the spiral is likely comprised of frozen rocket fuel that's ejected during the launch. The official English account of the Subaru telescope took to Twitter to state that the spiral seems to be related to SpaceX's January 18 launch, where the company transported US military satellites into orbit.

Holders of Djed\u2019s reserve currency, SHEN, will receive rewards for ADA held in Djed\u2019s smart contract at launch. COTI, the issuer of Djed, the Cardano stablecoin, revealed this in a Medium blog post shared on Twitter yesterday. According to the article, it is a temporary solution. COTI says a multiple-pool staking solution that will ship with Djed v1.3 will replace it. As explained, the solution will delegate the ADA deposited in the Djed smart contract to mint SHEN with a dedicated public staking pool operated by Wave Financial. Notably, the pool will calculate rewards using screenshots taken during each epoch. COTI says the pool will send the rewards to eligible SHEN holders at the end of every four epochs with no action needed on the part of recipients. As highlighted previously, SHEN holders can track these rewards using an interface created on djed.xyz. Notably, COTI first hinted at implementing staking rewards for SHEN holders with the current Djed version in a blog post on January 13. Meanwhile, the latest update from COTI has met with mixed responses, as some users have expressed misgivings over the choice of stake pool, noting that Wave already controls 3% of all ADA staked. It is worth noting that in the blog post released yesterday, COTI also revealed other details about the Djed protocol. Highlighting that the protocol will be restricted for large mint and burn transactions, leaving small transactions for exchanges, COTI revealed that users would be able to mint a minimum of $5,000 worth of Djed and burn a minimum of $1,000 worth of the stablecoin. Similarly, users could mint a minimum of 5,000 SHEN and burn a minimum of 2,500 SHEN. Notably, mint and burn transactions will attract a 1.5% fee in addition to operational fees of 100 ADA. Recall that, as previously reported , the long-anticipated overcollateralized algorithmic stablecoin is set to launch this week. According to COTI, completing the chain index syncing process is the only thing left. Proponents expect it to lead to a significant boost in Cardano\u2019s decentralized finance ecosystem.",

    "content": "January 30, 2023 French automaker Renault will slash its stake in Japanese partner Nissan as part of a deal rebalancing the rocky alliance between the two companies, the firms said Monday. The deal will also see Nissan take a stake in Renault's new electric vehicle venture Ampere, though the size of the investment was not immediately announced. The agreement comes after months of painstaking negotiations, and repeated delays, as the two firms sought to reset their decades-old alliance after years of tensions. The automakers called Monday's announcement \"an important milestone\" in \"discussions on defining new foundations for their partnership\". The agreement is intended to \"strengthen the ties of the alliance and maximise value creation\", the statement issued simultaneously by both companies said. Renault will reduce its stake from 43.4 percent to 15 percent, the same size as Nissan's stake in its French counterpart, in what the firms said would produce \"a balanced governance\". Nissan will also invest in Ampere, \"aiming to become a strategic partner\", the firms said, without specifying how large the Japanese automaker's stake would be. In November, Renault announced that it would split its operations in two\u2014Ampere, and a separate subsidiary for petrol, diesel and hybrid cars that will pair up with China's Geely. But concerns at Nissan about future technology transfers to the Chinese carmaker, as well as details over the sharing of electric vehicle intellectual property , complicated the negotiations. The agreement is expected to be signed next week following board approval from both sides. The international auto alliance began in 1999, when Renault rescued Nissan from bankruptcy. They were joined by Mitsubishi Motors in 2016, when Nissan took a 34 percent stake in its struggling Japanese rival. But the union was destabilised by the 2018 arrest of Nissan boss Carlos Ghosn, who claimed the charges against him were intended to prevent him from bringing the Japanese and French automakers closer together. Discussions have been held behind closed doors and the announcement was repeatedly previewed but then postponed. Still, analysts have described the rebalancing of the deal as a way to build confidence between Nissan and Renault, particularly after the fallout from the Ghosn scandal. There is also scope for the firms to cooperate on electric vehicles , given Nissan's existing technologies and Renault's greater access to the European market. After the deal is signed, the French automaker will not immediately sell the outstanding 28.4 percent of its Nissan shares because the current market value is lower than that registered in Renault's accounts. Instead, the shares will be placed in a trust for sale when prices improve, with no time limit placed on the process. Its voting rights will be \"neutralised\" for most decisions, the companies said, but it will retain rights to dividends and shares' sale proceeds until it sells. \u00a9 2023 AFP",

    "content": "January 30, 2023 by Roland JACKSON Ireland's Ryanair flew back into profit in the final three months of 2022 as travelers flocked to budget airlines during Europe's cost-of-living crisis. Ryanair logged a profit after taxation of 211 million euros ($229 million) for the third quarter of its financial year, or three months to the end of December. That contrasted sharply with a net loss of 96 million euros last time around, it added in a results statement on Monday. Passenger numbers soared by almost a quarter to 38.4 million passengers. That marked a seven percent increase compared with late 2019, just before the COVID pandemic ravaged demand for aviation. The Dublin-based carrier enjoyed \"strong Christmas/New Year traffic\" in the reporting period, winning market share in key EU nations including Ireland, Italy, Poland and Spain. Monday's news comes after British budget rival EasyJet last week hiked its annual profit forecast after record demand, as its customers also prioritized holidays and shrugged off sky-high inflation. Yet it also follows the weekend collapse of regional UK airline Flybe, which on Saturday filed for bankruptcy for the second time in three years, faced with fierce competition. Both EasyJet and Ryanair have urged Flybe staff to apply for roles. Britain, Ryanair's key market outside Ireland, is widely expected to fall into recession this year on the back of rocketing consumer prices. However, budget carriers have thrived over the festive period. \"Ryanair has built on its strong position of having a low cost base, strong liquidity and a ready workforce, substantially retained through the pandemic,\" independent aviation analyst John Strickland told AFP. \"All this translates into an ability to provide growing capacity to meet resurgent demand from customers focussed more than ever on value for money pricing. \"Ryanair has turned every crisis to its advantage over the last 20 years or so and this confirms the strength of the low cost business model.\" Nevertheless, Ryanair cautioned Monday that it still expects to register a loss for the last quarter of its fiscal year, partly because Easter falls in April this year. Earlier this month, the carrier predicted annual net profit of between 1.325 billion euros and 1.425 billion euros, upgrading prior guidance on solid festive bookings. \u00a9 2023 AFP",

    "content": "January 30, 2023 Japan's Toyota was the world's top-selling automaker in 2022, retaining its lead over German rival Volkswagen for the third year, company data showed Monday. Despite the chip shortage and COVID-related supply chain disruption, Toyota and its subsidiaries sold nearly 10.5 million vehicles last year, around the same as in 2021. In comparison, Volkswagen Group\u2014which held the top spot until 2020 when it was overtaken by Toyota\u2014sold 8.3 million units last year, an annual drop of seven percent. \"Despite the impact of production constraints caused by the spread of COVID-19, increased demand for semiconductors, and other factors, global sales were at the same level year-on-year as a result of solid demand centered around Asia,\" the Japanese car giant said. In 2022, Toyota sold 2.7 million electrified vehicles, around five percent more than the previous year. The vast majority of those\u20142.6 million\u2014were hybrid models. Toyota pioneered hybrid cars , but some critics say the company has been slow to make the shift to battery-powered engines even as demand soars for low-emission automobiles. A year ago, Toyota hiked its targets for the sector and announced it would roll out 30 battery-powered electric models by the end of the decade. Mio Kato, an analyst at Lightstream Research who publishes on Smartkarma, told AFP that Toyota was likely to keep its top-selling crown in the near term. \"In terms of the actual volumes, it will still be difficult for Volkswagen or General Motors to surpass Toyota easily because both are under more pressure in China with their internal combustion engine business,\" he said. Electric-only carmakers like China's BYD will one day pose \"a genuine threat\" to Toyota, he said, because they have strong battery technology and \"more experience and better branding\" with EVs. But electric-only automakers are still too small to have a realistic chance of competing with legacy carmakers for several years at least, Kato said. Last week Toyota named Koji Sato its new president and CEO, replacing third-generation chief executive Akio Toyoda in a surprise reshuffle of the company's leadership. \u00a9 2023 AFP",

So far the regulator has not approved any crypto ETF for launch in the U.S. While Grayscale has continued to fight the decision, calling the SEC\u2019s reasoning \u201cillogical\u201d earlier this month, Osprey is now claiming that Grayscale managers knew giving investors access to a Bitcoin ETF was \u201cnever likely to happen.\u201d Grayscale \u201claunched campaign after campaign\u201d to persuade investors that a conversion to an ETF was \u201cinevitable,\u201d the suit alleges. \u201cGrayscale knew that this message was false.\u201d Osprey also claims that Grayscale's supposed \u201cfalse and misleading advertising and promotion\u201d is the only reason it has managed to snap up a 99.5% share in a market in which Osprey is the only other player. \u201cOsprey has lost management fees and profits to Grayscale as a result of its unfair trade practices,\u201d the suit alleges. Lawyers for Osprey suggested that the firm should be awarded damages based on profits and fees it has supposedly missed out on as a result of Grayscale\u2019s conduct. Decrypt has contacted Osprey and Grayscale representatives for comment. The latest challenge to Grayscale, DCG Earlier this month, Osprey\u2019s founder and CEO Greg King published an open letter to Barry Silbert, head of Grayscale\u2019s owner Digital Currency Group (DCG), arguing that Osprey should take over as sponsor of GBTC. Dear @BarrySilbert , I have an idea for $GBTC . Give me a buzz when you\u2019re ready. We\u2019re just up the road from you in Connecticut. pic.twitter.com/zVFHBLxSl0 \u2014 Greg King, CFA (@GregKingOsprey) January 13, 2023 \u201cGrayscale and Osprey are the only providers with the required skillset [to manage GBTC], but only Osprey has the trust,\u201d he wrote. His firm is not the only one with a bone to pick with Grayscale and its owner. Earlier this year, Gemini\u2019s Cameron Winklevoss made a string of accusations against Silbert and demanded that he step down . Winklevoss and his twin brother, Tyler, are now mulling suing Silbert and DCG over an unpaid loan they made to now-bankrupt Genesis Global.

    "description": "Alameda seeks to recover $446 million in repaid loans to the defunct digital asset manager Voyager Digital.",
    "content": "Trading firm Alameda Research has filed a new lawsuit seeking to recover about $445.8 million from the bankrupt crypto broker Voyager Digital. Sam Bankman-Fried, the disgraced founder and CEO of FTX, also co-founded the trading firm in 2017. A day before FTX filed for bankruptcy in November 2022, it emerged that the crypto exchange had lent customer funds to help prop up Alameda Research. The latest lawsuit, filed with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware on January 30 by FTX lawyers filing on behalf of Alameda, relates to loans Voyager made to Alameda before the crypto broker\u2019s bankruptcy in July 2022. Voyager demanded repayment of all outstanding loans to Alameda, which, according to the filing, were fully repaid before FTX, along with Alameda filed for its own bankruptcy, in November. \u201cThe collapse of Alameda and its affiliates amid allegations that Alameda was secretly borrowing billions of FTX-exchange assets is widely known,\" the filing reads. \"Largely lost in the (justified) attention paid to the alleged misconduct of Alameda and its now-indicted former leadership has been the role played by Voyager and other cryptocurrency 'lenders' who funded Alameda and fueled that alleged misconduct, either knowingly or recklessly.\" The court document went on to say that the bankrupt crypto lender\u2019s business model \u201cwas that of a feeder fund.\u201d \u201cIt solicited retail investors and invested their money with little or no due diligence in cryptocurrency investment funds like Alameda and Three Arrows Capital. To that end, Voyager lent Alameda hundreds of millions of dollars\u2019 worth of cryptocurrency in 2021 and 2022,\u201d reads the filing. Alameda claims all loans to Voyager repaid As detailed in the document, Alameda paid Voyager almost $249 million in September and approximately $194 million in October. Additionally, the trading firm made a $3.2 million interest payment in August. FTX lawyers now assert that these funds are recoverable \u201con an administrative priority basis pursuant to sections 503 and 507 of the Bankruptcy Code\u201d and can be used to repay the exchange\u2019s creditors. FTX.US, the American division of FTX, was expected to acquire Voyager after winning the $1.46 billion bid to buy the digital asset manager out of bankruptcy in September last year. Adding more complication to the case, Alameda was also one of Voyager\u2019s shareholders. The news of Alameda\u2019s lawsuit against Voyager comes after the troubled crypto broker was earlier this month granted initial court approval to sell some of its assets to Binance.US in a proposed deal worth roughly $1 billion.

(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); With Google officially ceasing support for the Pixel 2 and 2 XL way back in 2020 , for hardware holdouts, this offers a bridge to Android 13. Given that no official support is available, a third-party ROM such as LineageOS 20 is a perfect opportunity to continue to squeeze yet more life out of the cult classic handsets. Google Pixel 2 XL postmortem: Was this \u2018peak\u2019 Pixel? [Video] The now-discontinued Google ADT-3 developer dongle is also one of the lucky recipients of LineageOS 20 support. However, this Android TV dongle is one of a few devices that are capable of officially running Android 13 . Given that there are no official avenues to buy this dongle, it could be a way for existing owners to tweak and test out functionality added courtesy of the LineageOS team. Another Android TV box is also gaining Android 13 though, as the Dynalink TV Box is one of just a handful of such devices to be able to run the latest OS courtesy of this third-party ROM. As mentioned, official builds have now been added to the LineageOS 20 roster for several devices including the Pixel 2 series, Google ADT-3, Nubia Z17, Nubia Z18 Mini, BQ Aquaris X, BQ Aquaris X Pro, and the Dynalink TV Box (h/t XDA ). Ordinarily, we wouldn\u2019t suggest that owners of devices still receiving official support opt for custom ROMs over stable builds. However, in the case of the Pixel 2 and 2 XL, we think that this is the best way to get a taste of Android 13 and all of the upgrades added with LineageOS 20. A brand new camera application is present, alongside all of the goodies added with Android 13. Plus there are fairly regular security patches added for that extra peace of mind. If you want to get started, you can find the full list of devices below with links to flash the supported build below: BQ Aquaris X ( bardock ) BQ Aquaris X Pro ( bardockpro ) Dynalink TV Box ( wade ) Google ADT-3 ( deadpoo l ) Google Pixel 2 ( walleye ) Google Pixel 2 XL ( taimen ) Nubia Z17 ( nx563j ) Nubia Z18 Mini ( nx611j ) It\u2019s worth noting that you will also need to flash the GApps package to retain access to the Play Store and several other Google services.

    "content": "Baidu, China\u2019s top search engine provider and robotaxi developer, is apparently working on its own counterpart to ChatGPT. The news, first reported by Bloomberg and The Wall Street Journal , sent Baidu\u2019s stock price rising on Monday to reach its highest point since September. A spokesperson for Baidu declined to comment on the reports. But it wouldn\u2019t be surprising that Baidu, which bills itself as the pioneer in China\u2019s artificial intelligence field, is stepping up to build the Chinese equivalent of today\u2019s most powerful chatbot. The question is how big a difference the tool can make, and where its limitations lie. A driving force shaping China\u2019s tech development over the past few years is the rise of digital sovereignty, which refers to a country\u2019s ability to control its own \u201c digital destiny \u201d and can include autonomy in critical software and hardware in the AI supply chain. Episodes of U.S. export bans on China have pushed Beijing to further call for tech independence in areas ranging from semiconductors to basic research on AI. As OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT shows the potential to disrupt sectors from education and news to the service industry, China\u2019s tech leaders and policymakers are likely pondering how AI can also be used to drive productivity at home. China naturally wants its homegrown ChatGPTs, not just to secure control over how data flows through such tools but also to create AI products that better understand local culture and politics. Slated to debut in March, Baidu\u2019s conversational robot will first be integrated into the firm\u2019s search engine, according to The Wall Street Journal. That suggests the chatbot will mostly generate results in Chinese. Nonetheless, the deep learning model is trained on both Chinese and English data sources, including information gleaned outside the Great Firewall, the country\u2019s elaborate internet censorship infrastructure. That\u2019s where things get interesting. Like all other channels of information in China, the Baidu chatbot will no doubt be subject to local regulations and censorship rules. As we wrote earlier, the firm\u2019s text-to-image application, ERNIE-VilG, already rejects politically sensitive prompts. But conversational AI handles much more complex inquiries than image generators \u2014 how will Baidu walk the line between censorship confinement and leaving enough freedom and creativity to its bot? Also important to machine learning performance is the undergirding algorithms. According to The Wall Street Journal, Baidu adapted a \u201ccore breakthrough\u201d that Google developed in 2017 and open-sourced, an algorithm that has also powered ChatGPT. Most likely, though, there are other key pieces of proprietary algorithms that Baidu has acquired or developed to form the backbone of its chatbot. Hardware plays another important role in training large-scale neural networks. U.S. chip sanctions against China are posing a threat to China\u2019s AI industry as companies lose access to advanced semiconductors that power supercomputers and large data centers. Baidu, however, believes the chip ban has a \u201climited\u201d effect on its AI business , as we reported. In the near term, the company \u201calready stocked enough [chips] in hand.\u201d As for the future, Baidu is counting on its Kunlun AI chip developed in-house to drive high-performance computing. Alternatively, it could work on increasing the efficiency of its algorithms to take some work off the hardware. Lastly, the success of Baidu\u2019s ChatGPT alternative depends in part on continuous data training through user feedback, such as giving a thumb-up or -down to the machine\u2019s responses. In other words, the more people using it, the better the AI assistant understands how to respond to humans. Ella Zhang, founder and CEO of text-to-image startup IMGCreator (who previously was working on AI-generated fashion models ), reckons that Chinese-language chatbots \u201cmight not see the same strong demand yet as English ones because China still enjoys relatively cheap labor.\u201d So instead of subscribing to expensive AI software and finetuning it to carry out customer service tasks, a Chinese company might simply hire a team of human staff for affordability and convenience. Things might change in a few years, though, as China gradually loses its labor advantage in a new era of negative population growth . How China is building a parallel generative AI universe",

    "content": "Three EMTs who responded to the fatal beating of Tyre Nichols were fired Monday after an internal investigation, the Memphis Fire Department said Monday. Robert Long, JaMichael Sandridge and Lt. Michelle Whitaker were found to have violated multiple department policies and protocols in their patient response to Nichols on Jan. 7, the fire department said in a statement. \"Their actions or inactions on the scene that night do not meet the expectations of the Memphis Fire Department and are not reflective of the outstanding service the men and women of the Memphis Fire Department provide daily in our community,\" it said. The fire department was sent to the scene of Nichols' traffic stop at 8:31 p.m. after police called because of a \"person pepper sprayed,\" the fire department noted. Long, Sandridge and Whitaker were directed to a second location and arrived to find Nichols leaning against a police vehicle at 8:41 p.m., 10 minutes after the initial call. Long and Sandridge responded to Nichols, while Whitaker and a driver remained in the vehicle, the fire department said. \"Our investigation has concluded that the two EMT's responded based on the initial nature of the call (person pepper sprayed) and information they were told on the scene and failed to conduct an adequate patient assessment of Mr. Nichols,\" the fire department said. An ambulance was requested after their initial interaction with Nichols, the department said, and an emergency unit was dispatched at 8:46 p.m. The department said the unit arrived at the scene at 8:55 p.m., and initiated care and took Nichols to a hospital at 9:08 p.m. \u2014 about 27 minutes after Long, Sandridge and Whitaker arrived at the second location. Voicemails left at phone numbers listed for Long and Whitaker were not immediately returned Monday evening. Sandridge did not immediately respond to an email requesting comment. Video of the traffic stop showed officers using force against Nichols multiple times, including pepper spray. The officers also appeared to punch Nichols, strike him with a baton and seemingly kick him in the face while he was detained, the videos released Friday showed . Nichols was taken in critical condition to the hospital, where he died three days later. The Shelby County medical examiner\u2019s office hasn\u2019t released an official cause of death. Preliminary findings in an autopsy a forensic pathologist conducted for Nichols\u2019 family show he was severely beaten before he died, the family\u2019s attorneys have said. Police initially said Nichols was pulled over in a reckless driving stop, but Police Chief Cerelyn \u201cC.J.\u201d Davis said her office has found no proof to substantiate the claim. Officers ordered Nichols on the ground , giving him conflicting commands, before he ran away. Officers pursued Nichols, using a stun gun on him as he fled, according to the videos. He was repeatedly pepper-sprayed before he was beaten an estimated 80 yards from his mother's home. Five officers \u2014 Tadarrius Bean, Demetrius Haley, Emmitt Martin III, Desmond Mills Jr. and Justin Smith \u2014 were fired Jan. 20 after an administrative investigation found they had violated department policy about the use of force. Two more officers \u2014 Preston Hemphill and an unnamed seventh officer \u2014 have been \"relieved of duty,\" police said Monday. Bean, Haley, Martin, Mills and Smith were charged with second-degree murder , two counts of official misconduct, two counts of aggravated kidnapping, one count of official oppression and one count of aggravated assault, prosecutors announced last week. Attorneys for Mills and Martin said their clients plan to plead not guilty. It was unclear if the others have retained legal representation.

    "content": "BRISBANE, Australia \u2013 It\u2019s a new year, and one filled with fresh optimism in the Australian music industry after the federal government presented its national cultural policy \u2014 a five-year action plan that puts in place sorely-needed infrastructure, investment and ideas. Prime minister Anthony Albanese and arts minister Tony Burke were on hand Monday (Jan. 30) for the launch of Revive , which, as its title suggests, establishes the groundwork for what government and industry hopes will facilitate a robust music space. It\u2019s a document years in the making. And it\u2019s stuffed with strategic and policy investment for contemporary music, many of them ideas put forward by a united front of music industry organizations, 18 in total. Revive will provide a much-needed boost of strength, energy and funding into our Arts community: \u2714\ufe0fEstablishing Creative Australia \u2714\ufe0f The establishment of Music Australia \u2714\ufe0f $70 million injection into Music Australia \u2714\ufe0f Supporting the artist as a worker and a creator https://t.co/56aXgFrPt9 Among the cornerstones of Revive is the creation of Music Australia, within Creative Australia. Government will find nearly $70 million for Music Australia, which will support and invest in the development of Australian contemporary music, and which Albanese is keen to see launch in 2023. Speaking at the presentation at Melbourne\u2019s Esplanade Hotel, Albanese gave the music community a well-deserved thank-you. He also mapped out a timeline for legislation which would enforce local content quotas on streaming platforms; a regional push for the Double J network, part of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation; and a 50% boost for Sounds Australia, which supports homegrown artists taking their music to the world. \u201cToday is a bright moment for (the music) sector but it\u2019s also an overdue one. You have endured a decade in which opportunity wasn\u2019t so much missed as thrown away. Capped by the years of the pandemic,\u201c he says. Revive , he continues, \u201cputs the arts back where they\u2019re meant to be \u2013 at the heart of our national life.\u201d Today, @APRAAMCOS wholeheartedly welcomed the Australian Government\u2019s National Cultural Policy, Revive. In the words of @deanapra : \"Long time coming \u2013 WELCOME! Vision, strategy, investment!\" More: https://t.co/2wqGT4hSNy Big congrats @Tony_Burke @AusGovArts @AlboMP pic.twitter.com/pI5nE1iWXN Revive is structured around five interconnected pillars, First Nations First; A Place For Every Story; Centrality of the Artist; Strong Institutions and Reaching the Audience. And with it, a commitment for new, additional investment totaling A$286 million over four years. \u201cThis is about our soul, this is about our identity,\u201d Albanese adds. \u201cIt is so important because it\u2019s about who we are and being able to express ourselves. It is literally through the arts that we build our identity as a nation and a people.\u201d When the center-left Labor government was formed in 2022, ending the nine-year administration of the center-right Liberal Party, Burke made an early commitment to develop a cultural roadmap through consultation with the music industry. ARIA welcomes the new National Cultural Policy announced today by the Hon. Tony Burke MP and the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development, Communications and Arts. https://t.co/w2hlbCkxju This policy, and its instructions, \u201crestores the place of art, of entertainment of culture, for all Australians,\u201d Burke says. Artists and the industry behind the music are \u201cessential workers\u201d he adds. \u201cYou touch our hearts and you are a A$17 billion contributor to our economy. You create art and you create exports. You make works and you provide work. You are entertaining, you are essential, you are required.\u201d For video streaming platforms, a timeline is locked in. In the second half of this year, legislation will be introduced to the parliament and in July next year, Australian content obligations will apply to the streaming companies. Revive pledges that, through binding rules on content, Australian music \u201cremains visible, discoverable and easily accessible across platforms to all Australians, driven by a vibrant, agile, sustainable and globally facing local music industry.\u201d \ud83d\udc4fToday we welcome the National Cultural Policy, bold new chapter and a transformational moment for Council as we work to build Creative Australia, a new First Nations body, Music Australia, Writers Australia, and the Centre for Arts Workplaces. https://t.co/fRtBTMEwID With the publication of Revive , the music industry is celebrating an ideal start to the week, and the year. \u201cThe government has responded to our collective call, which I think is a real positive,\u201d Dean Ormston, CEO of APRA AMCOS tells Billboard . \u201cFor the first time ever, there\u2019s a whole of government recognition of us as an industry. They\u2019re actually referring to us as an industry for the first time in my living memory. Which I think is an enormous win.\u201d Though the industry remains largely unsure of what are the next steps, conversations with government in the days ahead should clear-up matters. Regardless, the opportunities are laid out. \u201cThere\u2019s an enormous opportunity in terms of how music Australia interfaces with industry and specific government portfolios,\u201d says Ormston. \u201cThere\u2019ll be an evolving opportunity to have a much stronger relationship with portfolios, like education. We\u2019ve already called out, for instance, that Music Australia should have a policy and a strategy related to songwriting in schools. That would be the beginning of the foodchain and the pipeline to improving our export opportunities.\u201d Although the industry will need to wait for the presentation of the May budget to see full detail, the federal government \u201cis listening and responding,\u201d says Stephen Wade, chair of ALMBC, whose hundreds of members represent all areas of the live music sector. ARIA and PPCA CEO Annabelle Herd welcomed the policy. \u201cIt is true that Australian music is facing a crisis in streaming and that it is harder than ever for Australian musicians to have a charting hit in Australia,\u201d she comments. \u201cWe thank the government for acknowledging the need for greater support of Australian commercial music as a business that is facing key issues surrounding discoverability and export. It is our hope that the introduction of Music Australia will make important strides toward providing solutions to these issues, including a reassessment of commercial radio quotas and streaming policy.\u201d Today we launched our National Cultural Policy \u2018REVIVE\u2019. One of it\u2019s main policy components is the establishment of Creative Australia. pic.twitter.com/nlc8judwUD Read the document here in full .",

    "content": "This January, Germany\u2019s largest vaccine maker BioNTech announced that it had agreed to acquire Tunisian-born and London-headquartered AI startup InstaDeep for up to \u00a3562 million, including a performance-tied \u00a3200 million tranche investment. InstaDeep\u2019s deal \u2014 subject to regulatory approval and expected to close in the first half of this year \u2014 is quite intriguing, for a few reasons. First, when completed (at $682 million, adjusted in U.S. dollar terms), it\u2019ll become the largest acquisition deal involving an African or Africa-focused startup, besting prices bargained for Sendwave, DPO Group and Paystack . Second, unlike the other high-profile acquisitions, InstaDeep isn\u2019t a fintech. And third, although early believers who witnessed InstaDeep\u2019s growth from a local firm to a global startup knew it had enough exit options, they didn\u2019t think the acquisition would happen this fast, said Khaled Ben Jilani , senior partner at AfricInvest, one of InstaDeep\u2019s earlier investors, on a call with TechCrunch. In 2019, InstaDeep raised an $8.5 million Series A at a $30 million valuation, according to sources familiar with the round, which AfricInvest led with participation from New York\u2013based Endeavor Catalyst and a broad range of business angels in the global AI industry. The investment was AfricInvest\u2019s first involvement in an AI startup, a decision based on InstaDeep\u2019s founders selling a global vision to the Pan-African private equity firm. \u201cInstaDeep happened to be quite different from other companies in our pipeline as they were actually into deep tech versus applying technology to a certain sector, where basically, you become an operator in that sector. They were developing specific technology that could impact many sectors,\u201d noted Jilani on InstaDeep\u2019s pioneering tech. \u201cAnd it was also interesting, especially in Africa, where such companies are quite rare. And so when we had discussions with Karim over his vision and strategy, we quickly realized that InstaDeep could transform from an African leader in AI to a global player.\u201d InstaDeep utilizes advanced machine learning techniques, including deep reinforcement learning in applications within an enterprise environment that cuts across various industries such as biotech, transportation, electronics manufacturing and logistics. Ultimately, this helps companies optimize the decision-making process and improve efficiency. Karim Beguir and Zohra Slim founded the startup in Tunis in 2014 with \u201ctwo laptops, $2,000, and a lot of enthusiasm,\u201d CEO Beguir told TechCrunch last year . The bootstrapped company \u2014 which didn\u2019t receive outside capital until 2018 \u2014 depended on original AI research that Beguir published , which led to the startup being discovered by specialized clients who later became partners and investors, such as DeepMind, Google and its future acquirer BioNTech. As InstaDeep\u2019s clientele grew globally, so did its team. The company has 240 staff across Tunis, London, Lagos, Dubai, Berlin, Cape Town, Paris, Boston and San Francisco. Also, InstaDeep\u2019s ambition to become a global company made it move its headquarters from Tunis to London, which some publications have referenced as its home , thus neglecting its African roots. \u201cInstaDeep is a global company, but in terms of origins and like the company\u2019s early days, there\u2019s no doubt that we\u2019re African,\u201d Beguir told me on the call. \u201cOne of the reasons we founded InstaDeep was to show that there was real potential and opportunity for AI in Africa. So we want people to see us as a deep tech African startup gone global, which sends a powerful message of hope for the space.\u201d If anything, InstaDeep has proven that an African company with African talent can successfully serve clients globally while building a talent bridge corresponding to that growth. On the other side of the table are somewhat naive views that argue InstaDeep\u2019s \u201cAfricanity.\u201d Tunisia, due to its inhibiting government policies, is an unfriendly place to operate any startup or access venture capital \u2014 excluding InstaDeep, Tunisian startups raised $17 million last year, according to a report by VC firm Partech. As such, most startups have had to domicile abroad to access funding. Also, InstaDeep\u2019s influence in building AI talent on the continent isn\u2019t discussed enough. Last year, the upstart played a notable role in helping to organize and nurture Africa\u2019s AI ecosystem via Deep Learning Indaba and AI Hack , hackathons and events with thousands of AI talents and 400 researchers in attendance. Most importantly, an African startup serving clients outside the continent doesn\u2019t make it less African; in fact, founders should be encouraged to build software and AI businesses that present better exit opportunities than e-commerce, logistics and payments, sectors that international companies only consider when expanding into a new region. The ripple effect of InstaDeep building global-first is that it has put the Tunisian tech ecosystem and, more broadly, the AI industry in Africa under the radar with the news of its acquisition. Yet, it\u2019s too early to assume that because of that, it\u2019ll suddenly open the sluice of venture capital in Tunisian tech or Africa\u2019s AI market, which currently lags several industries as hotbeds of investments on the continent. There is potential, though, particularly with the applications of the technology in various sectors such as agriculture and manufacturing; startups like South Africa\u2019s Aerobotics and DataProphet have raised significant funding for this \u2014 however, patience will be required before any breathtaking activity occurs. To my question on whether InstaDeep is an outlier, Begiur expressed optimism that more success stories from Africa\u2019s deep tech and AI community would be told sooner rather than later, especially as the venture capital market has turned red-hot for AI-based innovation. When this happens, the CEO says he hopes that founders and investors reinvest back into the space, something InstaDeep and AfricInvest intend to act on moving forward. \u201cI believe that AI is a huge opportunity for Africa and I\u2019ve been vocal about it. We often see AI as a technology and a competition between developed countries. In reality, AI is essential for Africa\u2019s success in the 21st century, and the reason is that it is the transformational technology of our time; I think you\u2019ll see so many examples these days from GPT and beyond of its disruptive potential,\u201d Beguir, who is half-Tunisian and half-French continued. \u201cBut importantly, the barrier to entry to AI is much lower than, let\u2019s say, technologies of the past that were classically associated with legacy companies and strong superpowers. As such, it is a great opportunity for the continent.\u201d Last January, InstaDeep raised $100 million in Series B , over 12x what it raised in its previous priced round. Such was the proactive interest of new investors, including Alpha Intelligence Capital, CDIB, Google and BioNTech, its new owner with whom it started working with in 2019 and launched a joint AI innovation lab the following year to deploy the latest advances in AI and ML to develop novel medicines for a range of cancers and infectious diseases. Following the investment, InstaDeep was looking to make some acquisitions to ramp up its data collection capabilities to complement its AI systems before BioNTech swooped in with the acquisition offer, virtually leaving most of the growth financing untouched. \u201cThat was crazy. Frankly, we [InstaDeep and early investors like AfricInvest] did not expect that to happen,\u201d expressed Ben Jilani, whose firm may be sitting on a conservative 10x+ exit multiple based on independent calculations. InstaDeep exited at a higher valuation than what it commanded for its Series B, according to Beguir. BioNTech acquires Tunisian-born and UK-based AI startup InstaDeep for \u00a3562M According to a statement on the acquisition, BioNTech and InstaDeep have already developed multiple end-to-end AI-based applications trained on public and proprietary datasets across various scientific domains. These include projects to enhance neoantigen selection, ribological sequence optimization for BioNTech\u2019s platforms, and the development of an Early Warning System to detect and monitor high-risk SARS-CoV-2 variants based on their ability to escape immune defenses announced last January . \u201cWith BioNTech, we have developed a partnership over the years and completed many successful projects together. We see great opportunities to build the next generation of immunotherapies and become the leader in biopharma and AI. I believe this is an exciting time, and we will have more to share in coming months,\u201d Beguir said about the acquisition without divulging new information while adding that InstaDeep will use its Series B funding and exit money to scale its teams and capabilities across Africa and globally. \u201cIt\u2019s a continuation of what we\u2019ve done in many ways,\u201d he added.",

    "description": "'Black Mirror' creator Charlie Brooker and 'After Life' co-star Diane Morgan bring their obliviously comic TV presenter to Netflix with this five-part mockumentary about human progress.",
    "content": "The thing I appreciate most about Diane Morgan \u2019s Philomena Cunk character, introduced as part of Charlie Brooker \u2019s Weekly Wipe current events mockumentary series, is that once you have a character with the name Philomena Cunk, do you actually need anything else? It\u2019s a perfect comedy character appellation, with an overly flowery first name and a perfectly terse last name that contains multiple comedy \u201cK\u201d sounds and will always be adjacent to a somewhat taboo \u2014 less so in the U.K. \u2014 dirty word. Then you get the actual character herself. Cunk was first presented as a dim-bulb interviewer/commentator in three- to five-minute segments that were characterized by her ignorance and spotty research. But then, somehow, the character and concept were enlarged upon in a number of half-hour specials, and then in the BBC Two series Cunk on Britain . Now her second extended series, Cunk on Earth (another BBC Two launch), has expanded the character so successfully and made her so relatable that the new show is coming to Netflix for exposure to global audiences who might have missed all her previous incarnations. Sure, you can go on YouTube and watch most of Philomena Cunk\u2019s previous TV appearances ahead of Cunk on Earth , or you can check them out after Cunk on Earth . But really it doesn\u2019t matter, because Philomena Cunk has turned out to be increasingly funny the more Brooker and Morgan use her, which is far from normal when it comes to the expansion of initially one-note characters. And they\u2019ve achieved this without sacrificing the character\u2019s mockumentary core. At five half-hour episodes, Cunk on Earth is a consistently droll, frequently delightful series that mixes high and low comedy at a breakneck pace. The punchlines don\u2019t always land \u2014 in part because of inconsistency in the way the character has evolved \u2014 but if one observation feels too glib or one target feels too on-the-nose, don\u2019t worry. Philomena Cunk will be moving right along to the next. By the end of these episodes, darned if I wasn\u2019t seeing signs of actual emotion and depth poking through. They\u2019ll make a real person of Philomena Cunk yet! I wasn\u2019t kidding about the pace of Cunk on Earth . Over the five episodes, the documentary-style series covers the whole of human progress from the first Homo sapiens \u2014 \u201cWe often assume early men were stupid, because they had big eyebrows and said \u2018Ugg\u2019 \u201d \u2014 to ancient civilizations to modern religions to the Dark Ages and the Renaissance to the global expansion of Western civilization to the Industrial Revolution to 20th century wars and 21st century technology. There\u2019s so much material that Cunk on Earth can\u2019t help but feel a little more superficial than Cunk on Britain , with its hints of exploratory depth. But that doesn\u2019t mean there aren\u2019t pleasures in to be had when Philomena Cunk embarks on a journey of exploratory breadth. The conceit treats Cunk as a somewhat dead-eyed version of David Attenborough, traveling the globe \u2014 possibly for real and possibly just via greenscreen \u2014 and speaking with highly decorated experts about all the most important things related to civilization, including whether early humans had the same number of holes as we have, why society tends toward violent conflict, and the enduring pleasures of the video for Technotronic\u2019s hit \u201cPump Up the Jam.\u201d Morgan, who Netflix viewers may know from Ricky Gervais\u2019 After Life , is a confident performer with a varied range. She\u2019s intentionally understated and even bland, but if it\u2019s required by the bit, she\u2019s capable of doing a pratfall down a sand dune or getting whacked in the head by a wooden plank wielded by a Jesus impersonator. The writing team, led by Brooker, gives Morgan silly non sequiturs and ridiculous mispronunciations \u2014 I\u2019m still giggling at her pronouncing \u201cBible\u201d as something closer to \u201cBibble\u201d \u2014 but there\u2019s a complicated, often casually tossed-off joke structure to her prattle, like praising the smartphone as \u201cincredibly advanced and yet at the same time so simple a child can make one.\u201d I\u2019m not sure that Cunk\u2019s Marxist-adjacent skepticism \u2014 she\u2019s particularly cynical about the expanding American empire \u2014 lines up with the character so much as with Brooker\u2019s worldview, nor do I fully buy Cunk\u2019s existential pain at realizing that Laika, the first dog in space, died while up there, but these are things that give the character nuance and offer a reminder of how good and full a performance Morgan is giving. It\u2019s in the David Brent or Stephen Colbert \u2014 the guy from The Colbert Report , not the real guy \u2014 vein of committed obliviousness. The series and the character are at their best in Cunk\u2019s interviews with experts, as she politely, if somewhat indifferently, asks various Cambridge and Oxford educators questions like \u201cWhy do humans need to believe in something bigger than ourselves? Is it so we don\u2019t feel quite so fat?\u201d or \u201cWhy does humankind feel the need to invent killing machines like this? And could you keep your answer to a sort of sound-bite length?\u201d Whether the experts exactly know what they\u2019re getting into \u2014 some have been previous Cunk resources, while others are used in multiple chapters in this series \u2014 they mostly try to provide little educational highlights to counter their interviewer\u2019s inevitable confusion. You won\u2019t learn a lot from Cunk on Earth , but you\u2019ll acquire little bits and pieces of trivia or historical connectivity. The best of the interview subjects are even capable of finding intellectual depths in the stupidest of Cunk questions, which in turn frustrates Philomena Cunk, which in turn becomes even funnier. When an interviewee takes the time to show concern about Cunk\u2019s cluelessness, rather than just simmering annoyance or frustration, it\u2019s perhaps more than she deserves, but definitely what we, as viewers, deserve. Within the format concept of Cunk being a landmark documentary presenter on a landmark documentary, Cunk on Earth tries occasionally to branch out in style. One episode has a very funny faux commercial that I won\u2019t spoil \u2014 it made me laugh a lot. The episode on religion and the Dark Ages climaxes with a bizarrely imaginative one-woman fantasy sequence. A couple of smaller flourishes fall flat, but at least they don\u2019t last long. It\u2019s mostly fun watching Brooker and Morgan figure out the new and different things they can do with this character. For American audiences, Cunk on Earth works as a no-context-required introduction. Worse comes to worst, it\u2019s always just funny to say \u201cPhilomena Cunk.\u201d",

    "content": "Even if insects don\u2019t sound appealing to you, black soldier flies could play an essential role in the food chain in the coming years. In particular, these flies\u2019 larvae can become an important source of proteins for livestock and fish. That\u2019s why Entocycle is raising another $5 million in a Series A funding round led by Climentum Capital , a European climate-focused VC firm. Lowercarbon Capital and ACE & Company are participating in the round as well. Teampact Ventures is also investing in Entocycle. This new French VC firm is partnering with current and former athletes to invest in tech companies. In addition to contributing money, those sports professionals help startups with team-building advice and mentorship. In that case, Antoine Dupont, Nikola Karabatic, James Haskell and Antoine Brizard are investing in Entocycle. While Entocycle has been around since 2016 , the team of 21 people will now try and commercialize its products. In particular, with this new injection of cash, Entocycle plans to iterate on its flagship product \u2014 the Entocycle Neo. It\u2019s a hardware module that can be used in insect farms to monitor and collect data on the health and productivity of black soldier flies. The Entocycle Neo uses optical sensors combined with a software solution that analyzes images and accurately measures production. By automating these processes, Entocycle hopes it can increase productivity in insect farms. Using the company\u2019s modules should lead to higher-feed conversion rates and lower mortality. Similarly, Entocycle has developed a fly cage with built-in climate control. The idea is that Entocycle can help companies in the food industries get started with black soldier fly larvae so that they can secure their supply of proteins. And this is key to understanding the appeal behind Entocycle. Switching to insect-based proteins could drive down soybean production and imports, as well as deforestation \u2014 indirectly. Larvae are a low-carbon alternative as they can be produced anywhere. Insect farms could also integrate into the waste management cycle as black solider flies gobble down food waste.

Kutcher told Esquire he wants Masterson \"to be found innocent of the charges brought against him.\" He explained that no, he does not want his friend to \"get off the hook,\" rather, he genuinely hopes Masterson is innocent of the claims brought against him. \"I wholesale feel for anybody who feels like they were violated in any way,\" Kutcher said, seemingly responding to the three counts of rape Masterson has been accused of. Kutcher added that Masterson was something of their leader on \"That 70s Show,\" having been the only teen on the show that was in the industry for some time at that point. He said Masterson kept the cast in line and kept them from doing drugs and making bad decisions. \"He's like, 'One fucking rule: Don't do anything fucking stupid and fuck this up. Because if you fuck it up, you fuck it up for everybody,'\" Kutcher recalled Masterson saying. Even after the end of \"That 70s Show,\" Masterson remained as a mentor to Kutcher, Esquire reported. Kutcher added that he still keeps in touch with Masterson. In November 2022, a mistrial was declared in Masteron's trial on criminal rape charges after a jury failed to reach a unanimous verdict on any of the three charges against the actor. During the trial, three victims who were the charging witnesses and another woman testified at length about traumatic experiences with Masterson at the height of his sitcom fame. Famous actors like Billy Baldwin showed up to support Masterson throughout the trial. Masterson and his legal team had denied the allegations, and he pleaded not guilty to the criminal charges. In January, Los Angeles County Deputy District Attorney Reinhold Mueller announced that prosecutors would opt for a re-trial against Masterson, and Judge Charlaine Olmedo set a March 29 date for jury selection.",

    "content": "MOBILE, Ala. \u2014 As Senior Bowl practice for the American roster wrapped up late Tuesday afternoon at Hancock Whitney Stadium, Chicago Bears offensive coordinator Luke Getsy peeled off his team-issued pullover. Underneath, he wore a T-shirt from Veets \u2014 a bar at the heart of everything that happens during Senior Bowl week \u2014 and Getsy posed with Tim Zetts, the Bears assistant tight ends coach, for a photo at midfield. Advertisement Getsy, the head coach of the American roster and one of four Bears assistants coaching this week, is making the most of the experience. It\u2019s a chance for exposure, some networking and most important an opportunity to be a trusted voice in pre-draft evaluations. It\u2019s not the same as being an NFL head coach, but Getsy was charged with planning out the week \u2014 an important task to gain experience with for the next time he\u2019s in the cycle of head-coaching candidates. The Denver Broncos interviewed him for their top spot a year ago. Advertisement \u201cThe main thing is to find a way to get our football team better,\u201d Getsy said. \u201cAnd this gives you a good opportunity to dive into the type of men they are. \u201cI\u2019m in every meeting room. I am going to every position and getting to see how the guys interact and how they learn. Trying to get as much information on as many of these guys as possible.\u201d He said he found himself stepping back at moments during practice and putting the coaching hat aside to evaluate players, who are learning the scheme on the fly and implementing it. College tape is king in the evaluation process, and combine results and medical information go a long way. But there are more pieces to the puzzle. \u201cSee how fast they learn something and go out and perform it quickly,\u201d Getsy said. \u201cThat is the world we live in. We can\u2019t do the same thing every week. Have to be able to adapt.\u201d It was a challenge to learn the coaching staff assembled for the two rosters, with assistants from 16 of the league\u2019s 32 teams. That makes a clear line of communication essential. It also meant the week off that Bears coach Matt Eberflus gave his staff was a full week of planning for Getsy. \u201cThe exposure to the players is the main reason (for being here),\u201d he said. \u201cBut to be able to meet other coaches and kind of learn from them, and then on top of that maybe give them something, that part of it is the best. The networking part, getting to see good, young coaches, it has been a tremendous opportunity.\u201d Senior Bowl director Jim Nagy called Getsy \u201creally easy to deal with\u201d and credited Getsy with getting two offensive line coaches for each roster. Of course, that\u2019s a position the Bears will be looking at closely. Nagy, a longtime NFL scout, shared a funny anecdote of how his request for two O-line coaches initially was denied. Advertisement \u201cWhen the coaching list first came out, there was only supposed to be one offensive line coach,\u201d Nagy said. \u201cAnd on the first introductory call with the league when we were voting on the staffs, I was like, \u2018Guys, I don\u2019t think we can get through the week with one offensive line coach on each team.\u2019 \u201cIt didn\u2019t happen. I lobbied for it, I got shot down. And the next day I got a call from Luke and he was like, \u2018I don\u2019t know how we\u2019re getting through the week with only one offensive line coach.\u2019 We see a lot of things the same.\u201d With Getsy pushing for more help in the trenches, the league agreed to it. As far as the Bears and working to help quarterback Justin Fields, Getsy said the staff hasn\u2019t started a deep dive into the specifics of the offseason plan. \u201dWhen we get back next week, we\u2019ll begin that phase,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re putting it all together, so when I get back we can hit that running. \u201cWe took that time to do exit interviews and I spent a lot of time with each guy. I made sure I spent 20 to 30 minutes with each guy to really dive into the process and make sure we\u2019re giving them everything they need to be successful.\u201d Bear down (in Mobile) There aren\u2019t a lot of head coaches present, but Eberflus was at both practices, spending time on his own and with general manager Ryan Poles. Other head coaches spotted included Brian Daboll (New York Giants), Dennis Allen (New Orleans Saints) and Mike Vrabel (Tennessee Titans). Eberflus has to hire a defensive backs coach to replace James Rowe, who left for the University of South Florida. Nuggets Ohio State right tackle Dawand Jones was a mountain of a man during the National practice in the morning, mauling a handful of defensive ends. He measured 6-foot-8 and weighed 375 pounds with a incredible 89\u00bd-inch wingspan. Jones can make up for a lack of quickness with his sheer size and power, and that was on full display. Maryland left tackle Jaelyn Duncan looked good in the National practice as well. North Dakota State\u2019s Cody Mauch was working at left guard. Many NFL scouts believe Mauch projects as an interior lineman. Auburn defensive end Derick Hall had a nice practice for the American squad. He\u2019s 6-2, 252 with 34\u215c-inch arms and flashed a nice arm/under move getting to the quarterback. He has the range to play in space too. Oregon State\u2019s Luke Musgrave projects as a Y tight end with the ability to be a big-time target in the middle of the field. A knee injury limited him to two games in the fall, but he looks like a Day 2 pick at worst. Two American cornerbacks stood out: Kansas State\u2019s Julius Brents and Miami\u2019s Tyrique Stevenson.",

    "description": "The Memphis case is significant because it continues to raise the issue of systemic racism and has sparked protests nationwide, including one in Detroit. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0",
    "content": "As police departments once again scramble to prevent deaths \u2014 like that of Tyre Nichols, who was brutally beaten by Memphis police officers just three days before he died \u2014 a recent report by University of Michigan researchers finds three reforms that, so far, seem to be working. The U-M report \u2014 \"Evidence on Measures to Reduce Excessive Use of Force by the Police\" by H. Luke Schaefer, a professor of social justice and policy; Mara Ostfeld, an assistant research scientist, and Trevor Bechtel, an adjunct social work instructor \u2014 identified three key findings: Black, Latino and female officers are less likely to use force in comparison to white officers and men. Stricter firearm policies have the \"most consistent relationship\" with reducing the use of force among police. And evidence suggests that recording incidents with body cameras reduced use of force and civilian complaints. The Memphis case is significant because it continues to raise the issues of police brutality and systemic racism, and has sparked peaceful protests nationwide, including one in Detroit . For many, the high-profile case also puts police brutality in a new context, because, in the Memphis, Tennessee, case, the five officers charged in the slaying of the young Black man are also Black, and the chief is a Black woman. Some say the death underscores the violence that has been inherent in police culture for decades. The research found about 1,000 people \u2014 more white, than Black \u2014 are killed by police each year. It also pointed out that American police \"kill more people in days than other countries do in years\" yet, \"how to turn the tide on this national challenge remains unclear.\" The U-M brief \u2014 citing about 60 sources in a January report \u2014 reviewed more than a dozen policy reforms, including several that are included in the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act that was passed in the U.S. House but has since stalled in the Senate. But, the researchers also concluded, the data on police brutality cases overall is inconsistent, and there has not been enough study on the topic \"to tell us which of the commonly advocated reforms are effective at reducing police use of force rates.\" Boosting racial diversity Memphis authorities said Monday that two more officers , including one who is white, had been relieved of duty after Nichols \u2014 a 29-year-old father and FedEx worker \u2014 was pulled over on Jan. 7, and then hit, Tased and pepper-sprayed as he begged for his mother. And publicly released video recordings of the incident also are raising questions not just about police, but also about the emergency medical responders and whether they should have done more to help or whether swifter action on their part could have prevented or mitigated medical harm. Since the Memphis case, news reports have asked: Does racial diversity in policing address police brutality? The U-M report concluded yes, for the most part, diverse hiring and department leadership seems to have helped but added that \"it is not clear that efforts to recruit more women and non-white officers will necessarily reduce use of force rates in the future.\" The report noted that increasing the racial diversity of departments and creating departments more representative of the communities they serve is a commonly proposed reform. Earlier research \"did not find strong evidence to support diversification as an effective means of reducing use of force or misconduct.\" However, recent studies found non-white officers are \"significantly less likely to stop, arrest, and use force against civilians, especially Black civilians, relative to white officers.\" Moreover, police departments that used \"affirmative action plans to increase the number of non-white officers also have seen reduced rates of crime victimization among Black and on-white civilians.\" The report said studies found the racial identity of police leadership also matters: Rates of fatal shootings by officers are almost 50% higher in cities with police forces led by white chiefs than in cities with Black police chiefs. And, studies have shown that female officers were less likely to arrest and use force than males. A fear of being shot In Memphis, Nichols was beaten, not shot. But the U-M report suggests one theory for why law enforcement officers in general shoot more people than their counterparts in other countries \u2014 and perhaps are so quick to turn to violence: Police are afraid the people they are facing are armed and will try to kill them. Lower levels of gun ownership are associated with lower levels of police shootings, the report found. Officers also are trained to be aware that everyone they contact may have a gun. At the same time, the U-M report found, requiring the use of operational body cameras may have a \"deterrent effect on officer misconduct, disrespect, and excessive use of force, as well as to aid in training, transparency and accountability.\" In the Nichols case, body cameras not only documented what happened and became a part of the national conversation, but, according to news reports, also contradicted a written police report that claimed Nichols was violent and made no mention the kicks and punches by police. The U-M report found research was somewhat inconsistent on body cams, with early results showing the cameras reduced the use of force, and later findings showing no statistically significant differences. But it did seem to support the notion that when cameras were on, police tended to be more respectful. Overall, the report said, research on body cameras \"has offered promising results\" that could reduce police brutality. One proposed reform that the report looked at \u2014 one that it said is an expectation of \"virtually all police departments\" but had not been \"explicitly mandated until recently\" \u2014 is a duty to intervene and take action to stop misconduct by colleagues. The report said there is no evidence \"assessing a causal relationship between duty to intervene policies or training programs and police behavior.\" It did say, however, there is \"some evidence\" that training helps and departments with such policies have fewer police killings.

    "description": "A new study finds that even mild head injuries can cause cognitive problems over time, raising concerns for high-risk athletes like NFL players.",
    "content": "Head injuries are a major risk factor for brain problems later in life, and even minor damage may stack up over time, new research suggests. Just one moderate-to-severe concussion, or multiple milder concussions, can causing lasting issues with memory and attention later in life, and each subsequent injury may worsen symptoms, according to UK researchers. The research team from the University of Oxford, University of Exeter, and Kings College London looked at data from more than 15,000 UK residents between age 50 and 90, comparing their lifetime history of head injuries with changes in their cognitive functioning over time. Their findings, published January 27 in the Journal of Neurotrauma, show that experiencing three mild concussions is linked to worse attention span and problem-solving ability. Experiencing four or more concussions was linked to memory problems and slower processing speed. People who experienced a single moderate or severe concussion also had issues with attention span, problem solving, and processing information. The study, the largest of its kind, also indicates that the lasting effects of brain injury can worsen over time with repeated head injuries, according to Dr. Vanessa Raymont, senior author of the study and senior clinical researcher in the department of psychiatry at the University of Oxford. \"We know that head injuries are a major risk factor for dementia, and this large-scale study gives the greatest detail to date on a stark finding - the more times you injure your brain in life, the worse your brain function could be as you age,\" Raymont said in a press release. She added that the findings suggest the importance of proactive safety measures for people at high risk of head injuries through work or sports, and said that organizations should prioritize protecting their athletes and employees from repeated impacts. The latest concussion research adds to a growing awareness around the risks of contact sports like American football, which has a well-documented history of serious injuries and lasting damage to athletes. Most recently, Miami Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa suffered two head injuries in four days. The incident prompted changes to the NFL's safety protocols. Former NFL players have reported ongoing issues with brain health potentially related to chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or CTE, progressively worsening cognitive decline after repeated head injuries, Insider previously reported . Other contact sport organization such as the UFC have also outlined concussion safety measures in recent years, reflecting concerns about cumulative damage to athletes' brains.",

    "description": "Chinese technical support for Russian mercenaries in Ukraine, North Korean nukes and the prospect of a Chinese military invasion of Taiwan could all be on the table when Secretary of State Antony Blinken touches down in Beijing for a high-stakes diplomatic visit this weekend. Or not.",
    "content": "Print By Guy Taylor - The Washington Times - Updated: 6:30 p.m. on Tuesday, January 31, 2023 Chinese technical support for Russian mercenaries in Ukraine, North Korean nukes and the prospect of a Chinese military invasion of Taiwan could all be on the table when Secretary of State Antony Blinken touches down in Beijing for a high-stakes diplomatic visit this weekend. Or not. The Biden administration has been tight-lipped on Mr. Blinken\u2019s agenda for the Feb. 5-6 visit, although sources say the central goal is to tamp down rising Cold War-style tensions between Washington and Beijing that nearly hit a boiling point after former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s visit to Taiwan last summer. Mr. Blinken is being dispatched to try and build on the guarded smiles President Biden and Chinese leader Xi Jinping exchanged in November on the sidelines of the Group of 20 gathering in Indonesia, where Mr. Biden vowed America will \u201ccompete vigorously\u201d with China, but also seek to \u201cmaintain open lines of communication.\u201d The two sides agreed to explore areas where they could cooperate, including on such issues as climate change and curbing the trafficking of the deadly synthetic opioid fentanyl into the U.S. White House national security spokesman John Kirby portrayed the trip as a way to at least re-start conversations on issues that had been frozen in recent months as bilateral relations cratered. \u201cOne of the goals of this trip is to see about getting some of those vehicles restored and/or revitalized,\u201d he said, calling the U.S.-China relationship \u201cthe most consequential bilateral relationship in the world.\u201d But the relationship is so fraught overall that analysts say success for Mr. Blinken may consist of simply establishing a basic and stable diplomatic track with Chinese Communist Party (CCP) officials to cool down talk of a direct military clash between the world\u2019s most powerful democracy and its most powerful autocracy. \u201cThis is really about reestablishing the undergirding of the relationship and putting in place some procedures and mechanisms,\u201d said Jude Blanchette, a China expert with the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \u201cThe White House views this trip as just another step in building on the trajectory since November,\u201d she told reporters on a call previewing the trip this week. \u201cThey don\u2019t say this, but I think the goal is to basically fast-forward this Cold War to its detente phase, thereby skipping a Cuban Missile Crisis.\u201d But it remains to be seen whether the most sensitive matters will be pushed to the back burner during Mr. Blinken\u2019s trip. With the White House eager to promote calm in the relationship, things like coordination on climate change initiatives will likely be expressed. More divisive issues, such as Beijing\u2019s purchase of Iranian oil in violation of U.S. sanctions, its blind eye toward the sale of nuclear equipment by Chinese companies to North Korea, and its repressive policies against the minority Uyghur Muslims in western China are unlikely to be front and center. China has its own grievances, including U.S. rising engagement with Taiwan, the continuing high tariffs on Chinese exports and frustration over the Biden administration\u2019s widening push to limit Beijing\u2019s access to the high-tech microchips that U.S. officials fear could be used in futuristic weapons for China\u2019s expanding military forces. Taiwan is a top producer of such chips and Washington has pushed for months on Taipei to block their sale to Chinese companies. The New York Times has reported that the Netherlands and Japan, both makers of some of the world\u2019s most advanced equipment for manufacturing the chips, have also recently agreed to join the U.S.-led effort to curb sales to China. The wider issue of Mr. Xi\u2019s vow to bring U.S.-backed Taiwan under Beijing\u2019s control \u2014 using military force if necessary \u2014 hangs more broadly over Mr. Blinken\u2019s visit. The secretary of state\u2019s trip coincides with rising outrage in Beijing over a U.S. general\u2019s leaked memo predicting war with China by 2025 and reports that new House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, California Republican, intends to follow Mrs. Pelosi with a visit of his own to Taiwan in the coming months. \u201cChina opposes any form of official interaction between its Taiwan region and countries having diplomatic ties with China,\u201d a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman told reporters this week, referring to the autonomous island democracy as part of mainland China. A recent commentary published by the state-aligned Global Times newspaper in Beijing warned that \u201cif McCarthy does visit Taiwan in 2023, \u2026 China-U.S. relations will witness another shock comparable to or even worse than that in August 2022 when Pelosi visited Taiwan.\u201d Mrs. Pelosi, California Democrat, became the highest-ranking American official to visit Taiwan in a quarter-century last August. Beijing responded with a series of aerial and naval maneuvers of unprecedented score in the waters around Taiwan. The trip would symbolize the new House GOP majority\u2019s support for Taiwan, which Mr. Biden has repeatedly said would be backed by U.S. military forces in the event of an attack by China. Mr. McCarthy first signaled last July that he would visit Taiwan if he became speaker, a trip that would symbolize the new House GOP majority\u2019s support for the island. House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Michael McCaul told Fox News recently that the risk of a U.S.-China conflict is \u201cvery high.\u201d While Mr. McCaul criticized the Biden administration, claiming a clash over Taiwan could happen because the president is \u201cprojecting weakness,\u201d the congressman\u2019s warning dovetailed with a sobering assessment that the two sides are headed for sharper conflicts. Taiwan looms large Analysts say Mr. Blinken is likely to tread carefully on the Taiwan issue in meetings with Chinese diplomats. The State Department has not officially announced the dates of Mr. Blinken\u2019s visit to Beijing and dodged questions about his specific agenda. A Chinese Foreign Ministry official confirmed the trip on Jan. 17, telling reporters the two sides were \u201cin communication\u201d over plans for the visit. Politico has reported that Mr. Blinken will meet with Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang on February 5th and 6th. But it is not known whether the secretary of state will be granted a meeting with Mr. Xi. If a Xi-Blinken meeting does occur, it could indicate China\u2019s leadership desires for a thaw in tensions over Taiwan and other issues, perhaps even those involving North Korea. China is North Korea\u2019s primary economic backer and main ally. Pyongyang has refused all diplomatic overtures from the Biden White House and set regional tensions soaring with a series of weapons tests last year that many fear is a prelude to the North\u2019s seventh test of a nuclear weapon. Following the Biden-Xi meeting in November, Mr. Biden said he had told Mr. Xi that Beijing had an obligation to stop North Korea from carrying out a nuclear weapon test. While U.S. intelligence began warning as far back as May of last year that such a test may be imminent, Pyongyang has thus far refrained, prompting some in the American national security community to question privately whether China may have successfully convinced North Korea to hold off. Another delicate issue involves Beijing\u2019s ambivalent stance on Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine and, more recently, the apparent tacit support for the Wagner Group, the Kremlin-allied Russian mercenary force taking a leading role in the fight against Ukrainian military forces. Bonny Lin, who heads the China Power Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said Mr. Blinken will likely raise the issue while in Beijing. Ms. Lin noted this week that the U.S. Treasury Department leveled sanctions on Jan. 26 against a Chinese company for providing satellite imagery to support the Wagner Group\u2019s combat operations in Ukraine. \u201cSo this, as well as other concerns about the China-Russia dynamic and what that means for Russia\u2019s operation in Ukraine, are likely to feature in the conversation,\u201d she said. Mr. Blinken will be the highest-level U.S. official to visit Beijing since former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo visited in 2018 and former President Trump held talks with Mr. Xi there in 2017. \u201cWe should be watching who Secretary Blinken will meet and what will come from each of those meetings,\u201d said Ms. Lin, who noted that Mr. Pompeo was granted meetings only with high-level Chinese officials Wang Yi and Yang Jiechi, but not with Mr. Xi, who had visited with Mr. Kerry three years prior. Whether or not the Chinese leader grants Mr. Blinken an audience is likely to depend on how contentious the secretary of state\u2019s initial meeting gets with the foreign minister. The Chinese Foreign Ministry has suggested Mr. Qin will be welcoming but could be combative. \u201cWe \u2026 hope that the U.S. will perceive China correctly, pursue dialogue and win-win cooperation, not confrontation and zero-sum competition,\u201d ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin told reporters in mid-January. The goal will be to get the U.S. and China working \u201cin the same direction\u201d and deliver on \u201ccommon understandings\u201d identified at the Biden-Xi meeting in November in order to \u201cbring the China-U.S. relations back to the track of sound and steady growth,\u201d Mr. Wang said. \u2022 Guy Taylor can be reached at gtaylor@washingtontimes.com .

    "content": "Print By Ramsey Touchberry and Jeff Mordock - The Washington Times - Updated: 6:17 p.m. on Tuesday, January 31, 2023 Republicans in Congress are seeking to scuttle new rules from the Biden administration that allow retirement fund managers to consider climate change and other factors that conservative critics call \u201cwoke capitalism.\u201d House and Senate Republicans plan to file a Congressional Review Act resolution to force a vote on dismantling new Labor Department rules that allow retirement plan fiduciaries to engage in environmental, social and governance investing, or ESG, when handling clients\u2019 money, Republican Sen. Mike Braun of Indiana confirmed to The Washington Times. Opponents argue the rules jeopardize roughly 150 million workers and $10 trillion under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 by greenlighting retirement managers to invest workers\u2019 401(k)s in ESG funds, and by rescinding the Trump-era requirement that investments be chosen based solely on financial interests. Mr. Braun will file the resolution\u2019s Senate version and Rep. Andy Barr, Kentucky Republican, will file the House version. Sen. Joe Manchin III will break from his party to join the Republican-led effort as the lead and only Democrat, an aide to the conservative West Virginian confirmed to The Times. The resolution will not be subject to the Senate\u2019s 60-vote filibuster threshold, but it will still fail in the upper chamber unless Republicans can convince one additional Senate Democrat to get on board. However, the vote will force Democrats to go on record about the ESG policy as Republican state officials across the country wage a multi-billion-dollar campaign against the climate-friendly investment practice they say is part of a broader \u201cwoke capitalism\u201d trend. A similar endeavor by Mr. Braun and Mr. Barr at the end of the previous Congress in December was unsuccessful. The White House referred a request for comment to the Department of Labor, which declined to comment. The resolution will come in the wake of Republican attorneys general from 25 states filing a lawsuit last week against the Labor Department rules, which went into effect Monday. The officials argued that the agency overstepped its authority and that money managers should only be permitted to consider financial returns. \u201cThe Biden administration is promoting its climate change agenda by putting everyday people\u2019s retirement money at risk,\u201d said Utah Attorney General Sean Reyes, the Republican who led the lawsuit. \u201cPermitting asset managers to direct hard-working Americans\u2019 money to ESG investments puts trillions of dollars of retirement savings at risk in exchange for someone else\u2019s political agenda.\u201d The rules also remove a restriction blocking employers from using an ESG fund as a default option for workers automatically enrolled in 401(k) plans, which means Americans may unknowingly invest in the funds. The rules were unveiled in October 2021 and finalized in November 2022. Labor Department officials said the Trump administration\u2019s rules \u201cunnecessarily restrained\u201d fiduciaries\u2019 ability to weigh ESG factors when choosing 401(k) investments. \u201cA final rule is necessary to reverse the [Trump-era] rule\u2019s chilling effect on the integration of ESG factors into the investment selection and asset management process,\u201d Lisa M. Gomez, assistant secretary of labor for the Employee Benefits Security Administration, told reporters in November. Ms. Gomez emphasized that investment managers may consider ESG factors when making decisions but are not required to do so. \u201cWhile climate change is a critical issue, that\u2019s not what this rule is about,\u201d she said. Republicans say ESG is a coordinated effort by money managers to invest Americans\u2019 retirement funds into \u201cwoke\u201d causes, including climate change. In retaliation, red states have divested billions of dollars in state pension funds from some of the world\u2019s largest financial institutions, including $4 billion from BlackRock. ESG proponents argue that it makes financial sense to consider long-term climate risks when making long-term investments. Despite the politics that have engulfed the issue, ESG investing has surged in recent years. The total assets under management by ESG funds reached $40 trillion last year, up from $22.9 trillion in 2016, according to data from Opimas LLC, a management consultancy for financial institutions. Global ESG assets are expected to exceed $53 trillion by 2025. That would account for more than one-third of the $140.5 trillion projected assets under management, according to research by Bloomberg Intelligence. \u2022 Jeff Mordock can be reached at jmordock@washingtontimes.com . \u2022 Ramsey Touchberry can be reached at rtouchberry@washingtontimes.com .

    "description": "The 2009 thriller established Liam Neeson as an action star and paved the way for two movie sequels.",
    "content": "Bryan is a divorced, retired US government agent-turned-bodyguard who flies to Paris after his 17-year-old daughter Kim is abducted during a vacation in the city. He rescues Kim after tracking down and killing her Albanian kidnappers and the man who purchased her. For over 25 years, Neeson acted in a variety of roles: a Nazi in \"Shining Through\" (1992), a German businessman who saves the lives of his Jewish workers in \"Schindler's List\" (1994), and a sage Jedi in \"Star Wars: Episode 1 - The Phantom Menace.\" But \"Taken\" took the Oscar-nominated actor's career in a different direction, establishing him as a bonafide action star. Following \"Taken,\" which earned $226.8 million at the global box office, Neeson starred in two sequels, as well as action films like \"The Grey\" (2012), \"Run All Night\" (2015), \"Cold Pursuit\" (2019), and \"The Marksman\" (2021). While Neeson experienced professional success, tragedy struck almost two months after \"Taken\" debuted in theaters when his wife, actor Natasha Richardson, died after suffering a head injury while skiing. Neeson has been open about the loss of Richardson in the years since. \"She always packed so much into every day, Natasha, that maybe she knew she wasn't destined to be on this Earth for a long period of time,'\" he said during a \"60 Minutes\" interview in 2014. Neeson has six projects in the works, including the thriller \"In the Land of Saints and Sinners,\" costarring Kerry Condon, and \"Retribution,\" with Matthew Modine. Maggie is Bryan's 17-year-old daughter and an aspiring singer. After flying to Paris with her friend Amanda, she's abducted by a group of Albanians who traffic and drug young women, selling them to the highest bidder. After Maggie is sold in an auction, Bryan rescues her aboard a boat. He takes his daughter back to the US, where she reunites with her mother and stepfather. Grace has appeared in over 30 film and TV projects since \"Taken,\" including the two \"Taken\" sequels and \"The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn\" parts one and two. She also had roles in series such as \"Californication\" and \"Fear the Walking Dead.\" Prior to \"Taken,\" Grace won a SAG award for outstanding performance by an ensemble in a drama series for portraying Shannon Rutherford, a survivor of Oceanic Airlines Flight 815, in the hit series \"Lost.\" Grace has three upcoming projects, including the thriller \"Blackwater Lane\" costarring Dermot Mulroney and Minka Kelly, and a comedy called \"The Secret Art of Human Flight,\" with Sendhil Ramamurthy. Having married a wealthy businessman after their divorce, Lenore and Bryan's relationship is sometimes acrimonious, but after Kim is kidnapped, she begs Bryan to rescue their daughter. Since \"Taken,\" Janssen has reprised the role of Lenore in \"Taken 2\" (2012) and \"Taken 3\" (2014), as well as Jean Grey in \"The Wolverine\" (2013) and \"X-Men: Days of Future Past\" (2014). The actor also starred for three seasons as Olivia Godfrey, the matriarch of the Godfrey family, in \"Hemlock Grove\" from 2013 to 2015. In 2015, Janssen appeared for 10 episodes as death row attorney Eve Rothlo during the second season of the popular series \"How to Get Away With Murder.\" Janssen has at least four projects in the works, including the action thriller \"Boy Kills World,\" with Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd, and the adventure film \"Knights of the Zodiac,\" costarring Sean Bean. Sam is one of Bryan's former US government colleagues, who has since turned to private security with several men. He recruits Bryan for one four-hour stint at the start of \"Taken\" protecting Sheerah, a 25-year-old pop star. After Kim is kidnapped, Sam does some online sleuthing to identify her abductors. Besides appearing in the two \"Taken\" sequels, Orser has kept busy with roles in TV series, including \"24,\" \"Ray Donovan,\" and \"Berlin Station.\" His most recent projects include the now-canceled reboot of \"American Gigolo,\" starring Jon Bernthal, and a podcast series called \"The Callisto Protocol: Helix Station.\" One of Sam's former colleagues and friends, Casey is a part of Sam's private security team. He is part of the security detail assigned to protect Sheerah, a young pop star, at the start of the film. Gries has appeared in many TV and film projects since \"Taken,\" reprising his role as Uncle Rico in the short-lived animated series \"Napoleon Dynamite\" in 2012 and appearing for 30 episodes as Dr. Roberts in the show \"Dream Corp LLC.\" The actor will next appear in three projects including the crime thriller \"The Knife Thrower\" and the drama \"The Myth of Mathew.\" A former field agent and old friend of Bryan's, Jean-Claude initially offers Bryan a tip about Kim's Albanian kidnappers. But after Bryan kills several people involved in Kim's abduction, Jean-Claude tries to trap Bryan and have him arrested. Bryan eventually learns where to find Patrice Saint-Clair, who runs the human trafficking ring, by visiting Jean-Claude's home, shooting his wife in the arm, and forcing Jean-Claude to find Patrice's address from the French Intelligence agency's database. Rabourdin, who reprised his role in \"Taken 2,\" has since appeared in more than 70 films and TV projects, including \"Midnight in Paris\" (2011), starring Owen Wilson and Rachel McAdams, and \"Grace of Monaco\" (2014), with Nicole Kidman. The French actor has at least four projects in the works, including the crime thriller \"Fox Hunt,\" which follows a Homeland Security agent who works with Hong Kong's Anti-Smuggling Bureau to investigate a car smuggling ring.",

    "content": "Print By Brad Matthews - The Washington Times - Tuesday, January 31, 2023 Dallas-based startup Colossal Biosciences, the first company to specialize in \u201cde-extinction,\u201d the use of genetic engineering technology to bring back hybridized clones of extinct species, announced $150 million in new funding Tuesday devoted to bringing back the dodo. The company also has plans to bring back the wooly mammoth and a fox-like predatory marsupial, the thylacine or Tasmanian tiger. If successful, the specimens will be reintroduced into the wild and returned fully to the ecosystem. \u201cColossal is a new symbol for hope in species preservation and conservation. Their de-extinction achievements are making it possible for ecosystems to return to their intended state, which is an incredible breakthrough in biodiversity,\u201d said Colossal investor Erik Anderson. The dodo was a flightless bird native to the Indian Ocean island of Mauritius, off the coast of Madagascar. Made known to the wider world by marooned Dutch sailors on the island in 1598, the dodo had no fear of humans due to the lack of native predators on the island. By 1662, the dodo was extinct, its ground-level nests an easy target for introduced, invasive species like the pig, rat, and crab-eating macaque. If the project for the dodo succeeds, the plan is to rewild the species in its original habitat of Mauritius. \u201cThe dodo is a prime example of a species that became extinct because we \u2013 people \u2013 made it impossible for them to survive in their native habitat \u2026 as the first to fully sequence the dodo\u2019s genome, I am thrilled to collaborate with Colossal and the people of Mauritius on the de-extinction and eventual re-wilding of the dodo,\u201d Colossal Scientific Advisory Board Beth Shapiro said in a company announcement. De-extinction uses DNA from preserved samples of extinct species, as well as DNA from close living relatives. For the dodo, the closest relative is the Nicobar pigeon; for the wooly mammoth also being worked on by Colossal, African and Asian elephants are used. \u201cOnce a species is extinct, it\u2019s really not possible to bring back an identical copy. The hope is that we can use, first, comparative genomics so we can get at least one, and hopefully more, dodo genomes that we can use to look and see how dodos are similar to each other, and different from things like the solitaire,\u201d or Nicobar pigeon, Ms. Shapiro told Motherboard. Technologies developed as part of the potential de-extinction process could eventually have uses for human beings as well. Colossal CEO Ben Lamm told Axios that \u201cgrowing humans ex utero, full gestation, I do think at some point that technology is inevitable,\u201d although he noted that ethical concerns would drive more resources towards improving in-vitro fertilization in the interim. \u2022 Brad Matthews can be reached at bmatthews@washingtontimes.com .

    "content": "After some lean years, the major Hollywood studios are getting back in the game with the dozen or so film-related commercials for this year\u2019s Super Bowl essentially finalised. Studios are spending up to $7 million for a 30-second spot during the February 12th telecast of the Kansas City Chiefs-Philadelphia Eagles showdown on FOX. Some studios release longer trailers ahead of the game with cut-down versions during the event. Others hit during the event itself and then wait to see the reaction over the next 24 hours as social media catches up on the spots. Warner Bros. Pictures, which has sat out previous Super Bowls, is spending big with a spot for \u201cThe Flash\u201d film which will be the first footage from the film since the DC Fandome clip reveal over a year ago. Universal Pictures is of course going with a \u201cFast X\u201d TV spot which will come after an extended trailer arriving next Friday. It is also said to be considering a 15-second pre-game spot for \u201cCocaine Bear\u201d but will not be doing one for \u201cThe Super Mario Bros. Movie\u201d. Paramount Pictures reportedly has spots booked for \u201cTransformers: Rise of the Beasts,\u201d \u201cScream VI\u201d and \u201cDungeons and Dragons: Honor Among Thieves\u201d. Sadly there will NOT be a new spot for the next \u201cMission: Impossible\u201d. Disney Pictures is going big with no less than six spots to arrive this year including a first look at the \u201cCaptain Marvel\u201d sequel \u201cThe Marvels\u201d along with new spots for \u201cIndiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,\u201d \u201cGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,\u201d Pixar\u2019s \u201cElemental,\u201d the live-action \u201cThe Little Mermaid\u201d and \u201cAnt-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania\u201d.

    "content": "Bayern Munich manager Julian Nagelsmann had watched his team scuffle its way through three consecutive draws since the re-start and might have felt his seat get a bit hotter. There were controversies, doubt, talk of a crisis, and more hovering over the squad, but the former RB Leipzig boss dug into his bag of tricks to help the team get a 4-0 win over Mainz 05 and advance to the next round of the DFB-Pokal. \u201cI\u2019m very satisfied with the result and the way we played. Games against Mainz and Bo Svensson\u2019s teams are extremely difficult. We were more aggressive with the ball going forward than in recent games. We defended well and kept a clean sheet which was important,\u201d said Bayern Munich manager Julian Nagelsmann (as captured by @iMiaSanMia ). \u201cIt was a deserved and important win, not only for this competition but also after we failed to win our games since the start of the year. We want more of the same against Wolfsburg on Sunday.\u201d Nagelsmann rolled out a back three-based formation, swapped out some regular starters, pushed in newcomer Joao Cancelo and things just meshed much better than many probably expected. In many ways, this was exactly what Nagelsmann \u2014 and the team \u2014 needed to get back on track. Interested in a more in-depth look at the match, including the formation/tactics deployed by Julian Nagelsmann, Joao Cancelo\u2019s debut, and the amazing influence of Thomas Muller?

    "content": "I don\u2019t remember the first time I saw one of Jeff Jackson\u2019s TikTok videos, but I definitely remember the one that turned me into a follower. The new Republican majority in the House of Representatives was in chaos. I was on the West Coast with my non-politically obsessed family and a friend, watching Republicans fail to elect Kevin McCarthy as speaker of the House 14 times over the course of four days. We weren\u2019t just watching a historic fail unfold (the kind of embarrassment Congress hadn\u2019t seen in a century ). We were also seeing a confounding stalemate preventing the country from having a fully functioning government. Part of my job as a political reporter during this tumultuous week was to understand why this was happening and explain it to the world ( my Vox colleagues on Capitol Hill took the lead on this). But Jeff Jackson, a Democrat and incoming first-term representative from North Carolina, was a step ahead of me. \u201cI told you that the next time you heard from me I would be an official member of Congress, and then something very strange happened, and I\u2019m still not,\u201d he said in a TikTok posted to his 300,000 followers on the penultimate day of the GOP\u2019s speaker fight. Wearing a burgundy tie loosely around his neck, Jackson looked directly into my eyes and told me about the Freedom Caucus, the group of hardline conservatives who held up McCarthy\u2019s speaker bid. \u201cRight now, there is no Plan B. Either these 20 folks cave, which they\u2019ve sworn they won\u2019t do, or the 200 other members of the majority party put up someone else as speaker, which they\u2019ve sworn they won\u2019t do. And nothing happens until this happens, including swearing us in.\u201d The whole scene felt very intimate, impressive, and quite informative. The 3 million people who watched this particular video must have felt some of this. And Jackson mentioned his other TikToks. Would they be any different from those of the scores of amateurish news recappers, college students, and aspiring Joe Rogans on political TikTok? I, along with 2 million other people, had already watched that 87-second clip (in it, Jackson describes the \u201cweird process\u201d by which new members of Congress pick offices through a raffle pulled from a \u201cmahogany box that is a century old\u201d). And as I clicked onto his page and kept scrolling, I realized something. Jackson was accomplishing something very different from most politicians: He was not just using TikTok to chronicle his journey from candidate to officeholder; he was actually connecting with people. Given the toxic nature of political discourse online, it\u2019s the kind of engagement the average politician can only dream of having. \u201cI\u2019m big on reaching people directly,\u201d Jackson told me during a recent interview. \u201cWe\u2019re already saturated with people who want to give us the daily talking points or the daily outrage. I don\u2019t need to add to that.\u201d Now that he\u2019s officially in Congress, Jackson is a rarity: an elected official posting directly on a Chinese-owned social media app that\u2019s facing the prospect of a national ban and growing security concerns, and that has already been banished from official devices in Congress. TikTok has quickly become a convenient bipartisan punching bag for politicians who call it \u201cChina\u2019s backdoor into Americans\u2019 lives.\u201d It wasn\u2019t always this way. Just a few years ago, TikTok was hailed as a potentially huge disruptor in politics , advocacy , and communications , but now Jackson is one of a small group of politicians using TikTok in an official or campaign capacity, and, in another rarity, has mastered the art of the political TikTok. It\u2019s happening at a strange moment for American politics and for TikTok. The short video app has never faced as much scrutiny as it has endured during the last year \u2014 for its collection, storage, and usage of user data, alleged spying on journalists, and Chinese ownership. The app\u2019s future operation in the US remains in jeopardy, and though a straight ban seems unlikely, a bipartisan consensus is forming in Washington and state capitals that the app poses a national security threat and requires major reform. Its CEO will testify before a House committee in March. It\u2019s no surprise, then, that the landscape of political TikTok is fraught. In reporting this story, I reached out to political strategists and about a dozen national elected officials, their campaigns, and their staff. Many, like the White House and Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign, didn\u2019t reply, while even some of the most well-known Democratic figures like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Bernie Sanders didn\u2019t want to talk about the app. Wariness of the platform can mean missing out on a powerful tool. \u201cEspecially for Democrats, understand that the bad actors who push misinformation and inflate conspiracy theories are overrunning social media with their content,\u201d Kurt Bardella, a Democratic strategist and former Republican congressional adviser, told me. \u201cIf we aren\u2019t on those channels flooding the zone with an alternative, we are essentially surrendering that playing field to the bad guys.\u201d A spokesperson for California Senate candidate Katie Porter, who has almost 500,000 followers between her two official accounts, was positive about the app\u2019s purpose: \u201cCongresswoman Porter has used TikTok to reach thousands of people who may not be on other platforms. She\u2019s called out Big Oil for fueling climate change, exposed Wall Street for hiking prices to earn record-high profits, and showed Californians how to vote by mail.\u201d Still, for some politicians, the nebulous specter of a national security risk isn\u2019t enough of a reason to stay off the platform or shun the communities that use the app. Well over 130 million Americans use the platform every month, including about two-thirds of young people, who tend to use it multiple times per day . That has created a potentially huge audience for those elected officials who invest time and energy into building a presence. The preferred social media app of an entire generation has been mostly unexplored by elected officials \u2014 even as some of them try to shut it down. The birth of political TikTok and the simultaneous risks it posed Like any social media platform, TikTok always had the potential to become a gold mine for communicators and politicians who learned how to fit into its culture and use it. Even before the platform took off in 2020 as pandemic shutdowns closed schools and businesses and brought society to a standstill, the app offered virality and social media fame to whoever accepted the lightheartedness and silliness at its core. Since its launch in 2018, comms and PR professionals lauded the app as a \u201c sleeping social media giant ,\u201d while some younger journalists and media professionals who had a hunch just how influential the platform would become urged politicians and legacy news organizations to use the app. \u201cI feel it\u2019s my duty to act as a liaison between [Gen Z] and the generations who came before us. So here goes: Old politicians, you need to get on TikTok,\u201d one opinion writer wrote for USA Today in November 2019 . It was around that time that the Washington Post\u2019s TikTok account became what my colleague Rebecca Jennings called an \u201c unofficial 2020 campaign stop \u201d for Democratic presidential candidates, who until then had resisted using the platform. \u201cLike all social media apps, TikTok has its own vernacular, and any transgressions of that shared language and sensibility stick out like, well, septuagenarian politicians on a social media app meant for teens. The fear of coming off as insincere or being flooded with \u2018ok boomer\u2019 comments is a real one,\u201d she wrote at the time. And for those who did try, the early days were rough. Only one candidate, former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Juli\u00e1n Castro, had an official account on TikTok in the early days of the Democratic primary in 2020. At its peak, the account only had about 500 followers, and it rarely featured the candidate himself. Other candidates, like Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, former Montana Gov. Steve Bullock, and Andrew Yang, simply opted for the Washington Post route: using a middleman to bring themselves to the app. That was also safer politically, avoiding the charge of inauthenticity (Gen Z can sniff out a poser better than a hog finding truffles), or \u201c cringe \u201d (essentially, trying too hard). But concerns over misinformation and disinformation came hand in hand with the rise of the platform. As early as 2019, researchers and journalists were warning about the potential for the platform to facilitate the spread of disinformation or election interference , and for moderators to censor content, as TikTok was alleged to be doing for videos related to pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong. TikTok\u2019s design is often cited as part of the problem: Viral audio can spread easily without necessarily being tied to the original creator, and the algorithmically driven For You feed that functions as a homepage for a user isn\u2019t transparent. The result is an endless stream of videos that feeds off your interests and curiosities without necessarily telling you how it knows what you want, and eventually traps you in an \u201calgorithmic content hell.\u201d (TikTok also recently confirmed that its moderators can artificially boost videos to make sure they show up in your feed \u2014 an open secret that many creators have long suspected and a tactic that other platforms have been alleged to use, like Facebook\u2019s inflated video view counts .) Then came the pandemic, and with it, the golden age of TikTok. That first pandemic summer, the app had been downloaded 2 billion times around the world and had about 50 million daily active users in the US, who overwhelmingly tended to be members of Gen Z. That number has grown steadily since, to the estimated 80 million monthly active users of today. It was around this time that Christina Haswood, who lives in Lawrence, Kansas, decided she would start using her TikTok account to jump-start her local state House race. The 28-year-old Navajo public health researcher was finishing up a master\u2019s degree at the nearby University of Kansas Medical Center and was the frontrunner in the Democratic primary, and she felt pressure to reach more voters, fund her campaign, and make her Native heritage better known. \u201cIt was first kind of a joke. The best thing to pass time with and relieve stress was TikTok,\u201d Haswood told me recently. Then she and her campaign manager began to wonder if they could use the app to educate voters about her election. Her first videos pulled in a few thousand views and were primarily informational, like checking your voter registration, requesting a ballot, and preventing the spread of Covid-19. But when she joined a Taylor Swift challenge (how do I explain this? TikTokers would strut toward or dance at a phone camera that they pushed away in time with the beat) and she peppered in short lines of text introducing herself, her personal beliefs, and her policy positions, virality took off. That video got over 600,000 views and sprouted a loyal following of young people who were intrigued by a progressive, queer, and Indigenous young woman promising to fight for Medicaid expansion and a cut to the food sales tax. @haswoodforks Meet Christina Haswood, the future for democratic politics in Kansas.\u2764\ufe0f #kansas #democrat #progressive #vote #fyp #foryoupage \u266c Love Story - Disco Lines She kept building a following in 2020 (and she won the race in her solidly Democratic district). She transitioned the account from what was mostly a campaign tool to what now is more of a behind-the-scenes journal of a young millennial who happens to be a state legislator and progressive advocate with 150,000 followers. \u201cI feel like trying to explain issues through trends and humor can be a lot more digestible than reading an article or legislative summaries or minutes or watching YouTube livestreams,\u201d Haswood told me. Since the 2020 TikTok boom, a small group of (almost entirely Democratic) federal, state, and local politicians and candidates have found similar success on the platform \u2014 even if they haven\u2019t won their elections. Matt Little , a former Democratic-Farmer-Labor state senator in Minnesota, and socialist Washington congressional candidate Joshua Collins , for example, built large followings of about 100,000 on the app as well, but both lost their races in 2020. Statewide hopefuls like former Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan , whose gangly figure and deep voice contrasted with the memes and trends he used to make fun of his Republican opponent J.D. Vance, and social media darling former Texas Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke built big followings through official campaign accounts during the 2022 midterms, though both lost. Two notable exceptions? Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and Massachusetts Sen. Ed Markey , who was lauded for using the app to build a cushion of national and state support in Massachusetts to beat back a primary challenge from former Rep. Joe Kennedy III in 2020. Though Sanders still uses the app to post videos shared to other social platforms, Markey\u2019s account has stopped posting since the midterm elections concluded. TikTok\u2019s algorithm, data collection practices, and Chinese ownership have long plagued it TikTok didn\u2019t seem ready to handle the influx of political content that would come with the 2020 presidential election, or with a once-in-a-lifetime pandemic. After the 2020 election and in response to concerns about election interference and political influence, TikTok banned political advertising before the 2022 midterms and limited political accounts\u2019 ability to fundraise through the app. But while many of these problems have plagued social media giants before, those companies and platforms aren\u2019t owned by a Chinese company. Establishment politicians have long viewed the app with caution because of this, and for the past three years, TikTok\u2019s parent company, ByteDance, has been in negotiations with the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, a group of government agencies that reviews foreign corporate transactions for national security risks, for the best way for the company to operate in the US. Recent reporting of misuse of American personal data by the company hasn\u2019t helped TikTok\u2019s case for proving its independence from the Chinese government, or its trustworthiness in light of alleged spying on American journalists. But most federal lawmakers default to saying they are awaiting the Committee\u2019s final recommendation. That hasn\u2019t stopped more ham-fisted attempts to try to shut down the app. In 2020, Donald Trump tried to ban TikTok by executive order, sending shockwaves through TikTok communities worried about losing access to the platform. That ban never went into effect, and targeted, mostly symbolic bans have since popped up in individual states, the halls of Congress, and the executive branch. A growing anti-China consensus has also developed into a general aversion by politicians in both political parties to defending the app, and as my colleague Sara Morrison has written, it seems like a matter of time before some major change happens to TikTok . Markey from Massachusetts, for example, has been a more measured voice among Senate Democrats concerned with TikTok\u2019s access to personal data and its effect on young Americans. When I asked his office about his thoughts on the platform\u2019s future in the US, a spokesperson responded with an acknowledgment of the trade-offs the app poses: \u201cThey are the best of technologies, and they are the worst of technologies. They can enable and ennoble, or they can degrade and debase. But he still believes in their ability to enable and ennoble \u2014 for example bringing young people together online around the Green New Deal climate justice movement.\u201d Markey also supports more stringent legislation to protect children\u2019s and teens\u2019 user data, like his Children and Teens\u2019 Online Privacy and Protection Act to implement a computer code of conduct, ban targeted ads to children, raise the age of consent for collecting user data to under 17, and empower the Federal Trade Commission to monitor privacy concerns for youth. That\u2019s a very different position from that of most Republican members of Congress, who support either a complete ban on the app operating in the US or a sale of the app to an American company. The trade-offs might be worth it Jackson, the first-term North Carolina representative, fully accepts the validity of the national security concerns that his colleagues in the House and Senate have raised. \u201cThe security concerns are real. I\u2019ve read what FBI Director [Christopher] Wray thinks about it, and I take his assessment seriously. I agree with not allowing TikTok on government phones,\u201d Jackson told me, referencing Congress\u2019s rules on installing or having the app on any government-issued device or public internet network. Apart from his personal and government-issued phones, he uses a third phone as a TikTok burner, with TikTok the only app installed on it. While he shoots and edits his own videos using Adobe Premiere, he doesn\u2019t use the app at work. And he thinks the reasons to remain on the app \u2014 like building trust \u2014 outweigh the reasons to leave. Declining trust in institutions is one of the major paradoxes of modern American politics. Few established news organizations, branches of government, federal agencies, and politicians inspire the same confidence or carry the same authority as they once did. Looking at surveys, the problem of trust gets worse as you ask younger generations. Jackson thinks that part of the problem has been an unwillingness by elected leaders and candidates to meet people where they are. That doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s posting through every controversy of the day. As a candidate, his videos tended to be more like daily journal entries, highlighting interactions with voters at community events. Some of his posts even feel delightfully mundane: what it\u2019s like to be a new member of Congress looking for an office, or a committee assignment, or, most recently, how his personal finances work. @jeffjacksonnc Rep. Jeff Jackson (NC-14): My personal finances. #politics #fyp #nc #charlotte \u266c original sound - Jeff Jackson Jackson told me that the biggest subject his constituents and his TikTok audience tend to ask about is political corruption and stock trading by members of Congress. Allegations that prominent federal officials potentially used privileged information to make financial decisions during the early days of the pandemic renewed calls in the past year to ban members of Congress from trading stocks. After seeing this demand in his comments, Jackson felt an obligation to film a TikTok walking his audience through his family\u2019s finances. That video showed me a lot of the still-untapped potential of political TikTok even as its future remains in doubt. Here we have a rather standard-issue member of Congress dryly listing out facts of his financial life \u2014 \u201cI have a 2017 Ford Fusion, which I bought used,\u201d Jackson says to the camera \u2014 not a revolutionary line of political communication or anything resembling social media fodder. But the video still went viral. It\u2019s been watched over 1 million times in just under two weeks. Will you support Vox\u2019s explanatory journalism?

    "description": "The next-gen tech will double energy density and triple charging speed compared to lithium-ion batteries.",
    "content": "In early 2022, Nissan announced plans to start series production of solid-state batteries in 2028. Before that happens, a pilot production plant will be up and running by 2025, with the engineering work completed by 2026. In a new interview with the British magazine Autocar , the company's vice president for R&D in Europe talked about the three main advantages. David Moss reiterated solid-state batteries will triple charging speeds, reaching up to 400 kW. In addition, Nissan is looking to double the energy density and cut production costs in half compared to current lithium-ion batteries. In this stage of development, the engineers in Japan in collaboration with scientists at the University of Oxford have created 10-centimeter square cells. The final cells will have just about the same size as a laptop. Nissan is working on all-solid-state batteries, meaning all liquid elements will be removed. Moss told Autocar the automaker currently has the edge when it comes to deleting the liquid electrolyte. Keeping it would have a negative impact on energy transfer and power. He went on to mention using the new tech will make it more feasible to launch large electric pickup trucks and SUVs. Featured here, the futuristic Surf-Out was unveiled at the end of 2021. However, 2028 is still a long way off, so it seems unlikely the concept was an early preview of an electric ute with solid-state batteries. It may or may not be related to a recent rumor about Nissan planning a small electric truck for the United States. Moss declined to specify which EV will be the first to use solid-state batteries, but strongly suggested it won't be related to current models. He explained a completely new architecture is necessary, mentioning Nissan could offer two battery sizes rechargeable at constant speeds without depending on temperature variations. Pursuing solid-state batteries doesn't mean Nissan has abandoned lithium-ion batteries as Moss believes the two will coexist for a while. A new generation of lithium-ion packs will be ready around the middle of the decade, with a cobalt-free battery slated to follow in 2028. The latter generation is estimated to slash costs by up to 65 percent compared to today's batteries. Solid-State Batteries Are Coming... Eventually: In the meantime, combustion engines remain relevant, but Moss said these won't be updated to meet the much-criticized Euro 7 regulations . The logic behind this decision is stringent emissions laws will make ICE-powered significantly more expensive in the European Union while EVs are estimated to become more affordable. Consequently, price parity between ICEs and EVs is a matter of when rather than if. Moss said: \"we're not that far away from where they will cross in cost.\" Nissan won't be the first automaker to have a production car with solid-state batteries as Toyota has pledged to beat everyone to the market by 2025 . However, the vehicle in question won't be an EV but rather a hybrid. BMW is one of several companies working on this tech and has promised to start pilot production in-house later this year, with a demonstrator vehicle due before 2025.",

    "description": "It has nothing to do with the new Acura Integra.",
    "content": "The Integra moniker returned to the North American market for the 2023 model year in the form of a sporty-looking Acura sedan. A few months before the debut of the Acura Integra, Honda resurrected the name for the Chinese market. The Honda Integra family now receives a new addition and it is one of the very few vehicles in China with an available manual transmission. The new Honda Integra Hatchback \u2013 Hatchback is actually part of the name \u2013 is built by the GAC-Honda joint venture and is, you guessed it, the more practical hatch version of the Honda Integra. Both the sedan and hatchback versions of the revived Integra are based on the 11th generation of the Honda Civic. The Japanese automaker will sell the new model in two versions. There\u2019s a hybrid variant with a 2.0-liter engine running on the Atkinson cycle. The electrified four-cylinder mill is good for 141 horsepower (105 kilowatts) at 6,000 rpm and 137 pound-feet (186 Newton-meters) of torque at 4,500 rpm. The big news, however, is the Honda Integra Hatchback 240 Turbo. This is a version of the car with a 1.5-liter turbocharged engine, producing 180 hp (134 kW) and 177 lb-ft (240 Nm) of torque. It can be had with either a six-speed manual gearbox or a CVT, depending on the customer\u2019s preferences. As CarNewsChina reports, manual transmissions are usually reserved for cheap cars in China, which makes the new Integra a unique offering on the market. The Integra's Alter Egos: In fact, Honda even gave the three-pedal version some design tweaks to differentiate it from the hybrid model. A small spoiler at the back and a diffuser with two integrated chrome tailpipes make this car look a little more aggressive. It also features a two-tone exterior finish with a black roof and black door handles. As a side note, it\u2019s worth pointing out that Honda sells both the Civic and Integra in sedan and hatchback body styles. While the similarities between the two are obvious, the Japanese firm operates two different joint ventures in the country \u2013 GAC-Honda selling the Integra and Dongfeng-Honda selling the Civic.",

Thousands of text messages have been published, and Jones' reputation as a conservative, family man has been challenged by his own words. His contentious relationship with his wife is definitely a recurring theme of the text messages, including having her followed by private investigators. Jones also had his ex-wife followed by investigators. Ironically enough, while Jones was having his wife followed by private investigators, he was having an affair with a married woman. The released text messages also detail sexual requests from Jones to his married mistress. In the text messages, Jones is very transparent about his depressing home life, and the Jan. 6 insurrection did not fix that situation. During that time, he texted his father and said that he lives in a \"black hole.\" Jones has been found financially liable for broadcasting lies and conspiracy theories for the Sandy Hook shootings.

    "content": "Politics Top Stories Republican Ruled States Ask Federal Judge To Shutdown DACA Program By Md Shahnawaz - February 3, 2023 Several Republican states have asked a federal judge in Texas to end the DACA program, which they consider illegal. The program was supported by Obama and Biden and opposed by Trump. The lawsuit filed seems destined to end the renewal of deportation work permits and protections for Dreamers, and phase out the programs over a couple of years. DACA Drawing Republican Opposition Nine states filed a suit to shut down the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. This controversial immigration policy was first under Democrat President Barack Obama and was renewed in 2022 by President Joe Biden. In the legal filing by the states that include Texas, Alabama, Louisiana, South Carolina, etc, the states have argued that President Biden overstepped his constitutional authorities without getting permission from Congress. The states said that the lawsuit is about the scope exerted by executive workers and not the wisdom of any particular immigration policy whiteout the approval of Congress. The states declared that the lawsuit was filed to determine the scope of executive power, and not to question the wisdom of any particular immigration policy. They declared that a president does not have the constitutional power to unilaterally override the laws enacted by Congress just because they prefer different policy choices. The Republican states claim that the president\u2019s decision linked with DACA, announced only on August 30 last year, is afflicted with the same substantive flaws as the previous decision of the president. They state contend that Obama\u2019s previous decision was already found unlawful by the Fifth Circuit and the court. The team also sent a reminder to the court that the Supreme Court had ruled that Obama\u2019s decision was executive discretion. It could also be an immigration enforcement officer not enforcing laws on the book. This includes a policy that stops members from writing speeding tickets for an individual suspected of driving above the speed limit.

Trump has remained the most productive fundraiser for the Republicans in recent times and pulled in around $9.5M over the last 6 weeks of 2022 through campaigning and joint fundraising. Donald Trump\u2019s decision to unveil in the footsteps of a tough midterm for the GOP, unrelenting donor fatigue, and his sustained absence from social media, especially Facebook, have all added to the money crunch, say Republican operatives. Donald Trump understands he will need to amass lots of money and raise it quickly. He realizes that it will be a tough Republican primary drive. His campaign team was recently expanded. It hired Campaign Inbox, a firm to gather funds from small donors. H is campaign managers have for long maintained that he will use the early part of 2023 to expand his presence in the primary states that go early to polls. There Are Indications That Donald Trump Could Still Accelerate His Fundraising But other reasons strengthen the belief that Donald Trump is capable of bolstering his cash intake. He has not launched a customary mail-fundraising apparatus, which is a tested method of gathering large amounts through multiple donations. His early fundraising campaign was hamstrung by the ban imposed on him by Facebook. Facebook was a top platform for raising funds in his last two campaigns. But Donald Trump was banned from the social media platform after he incited and directly participated in the January 6, 2021 riots at the Capitol. But there are indications that the company may revoke the ban. Trump also upset his chances by kick-starting his campaign after the midterms. It was bound to be a fundraising disaster for any candidate across the ideological and partisan spectrum.

    "content": "COTI shares exciting details about DJED\u2019s progress. COTI Network, the official issuer of Cardano\u2019s Djed stablecoin, has shared details about the progress of DJED . According to COTI, the ADA-backed stablecoin has received massive response and participation from cryptocurrency community members since it went live on mainnet . COTI noted in a recent blog post that a whopping 1.85M DJED were minted while 40K units of the stablecoin were burned. In a similar development, COTI disclosed that 21M units of DJED\u2019s reserve token, SHEN, were minted while 73K of the token were burned. It is noteworthy that the minting and burning of DJED and SHEN is a mechanism adopted by the developers to maintain a 400% \u2013 800% reserve ratio. COTI disclosed that in the first three hours of DJED\u2019s launch, the platform reached a reserve ratio of 800%, a move that halted the minting of SHEN. With SHEN\u2019s minting halted, people who held the token enjoyed the benefits of delegation rewards, fees, and farming rewards. Meanwhile, at the time of writing, the reserve ratio had plunged to 635%, giving other users room to mint SHEN. It bears mentioning that SHEN is used as an incentive to keep the system overcollateralized by encouraging users to provide backing for Djed using their ADA tokens. DJED Attracts Over 29M ADA As Reserve Backing Less than two days after launch, DJED attracted 28M ADA tokens as backing for the stablecoin, COTI noted. At the time of writing, the number of ADA backing DJED has surged to over 29.36M. The stablecoin currently has a reserve ratio of 635%, which implies that each DJED is backed by more than six times its value in ADA. At the current exchange rate, the ADA locked for issuing DJED on the platform is worth $11.79M. DJED currently has a circulating supply of 1,856,873.7877 (1.85M), while SHEN\u2019s circulating supply sits at 22,502,250.6463 (22.5 million), data shows .",

    "content": "It comes on the back of recent development feats. Senior XRPL and Xumm developer Wietse Wind has disclosed that XRPL and Xumm developer activity has gathered momentum in the past year. Wind made this known in a tweet yesterday. According to the developer, the only library XRPL Labs publishes that is not picking up pace is the signing library \u201cxrpl-accountlib,\u201d noting that this is because Xumm is doing more of the signing. The shared chart showed a staggering 811 weekly downloads compared to a previous 99 weekly downloads. Meanwhile, the increasing XRP Ledger development activity is unsurprising, as developers have released several new features recently, with proposals and plans for more. For Xumm, the go-to wallet for XRP Ledger assets, developers are pushing the envelope, slowly turning it into the everything XRP app. Recall that developers in December announced plans to launch the \u201cBuy & Sell XRP\u201d xApp, a web app embedded in the Xumm wallet to allow users to purchase XRP for fiat and vice versa. This app appears to have launched silently, as it is now available in the Xumm wallet. There are only three providers for now: In addition, developers launched an opt-in profiles feature. As reported , it is currently only available in beta mode for Xumm Pro users, allowing them to link their wallet addresses to a verifiable identity to enable less error-prone transactions similar to the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) but preventing impersonation. Furthermore, at the beginning of this week, Wind let slip that developers are also working on a QR payments feature to allow users to make crypto payments at retail stores. At the same time, XRPL Labs is also working on Xumm version 2.4.0, which will introduce native XLS-20 functionality. For the XRP Ledger, last week, developers introduced XLS-34d and XLS-35d . The first will allow issued tokens on the XRP Ledger to leverage negotiable payment features like escrow and payment channels. Notably, these features are currently restricted to XRP. XLS-35d, on the other hand, will introduce a more straightforward NFT standard for the XRP Ledger. In addition, developers are also working on a Hooks sidechain, as revealed by Wind this week. Per statements from Wind, over 100 developers are working on the XRP Ledger.",

    "content": "Indian couple Utkarsh Saxena, left, and Ananya Kotia, chat inside a public park in New Delhi, India, Jan. 18, 2023. The couple, now 15 years into their relationship, is joined by three other couples who have filed a petition to India's Supreme Court that seeks the legalization of same-sex marriage. Altaf Qadri/AP hide caption Indian couple Utkarsh Saxena, left, and Ananya Kotia, chat inside a public park in New Delhi, India, Jan. 18, 2023. The couple, now 15 years into their relationship, is joined by three other couples who have filed a petition to India's Supreme Court that seeks the legalization of same-sex marriage. NEW DELHI \u2014 Utkarsh Saxena and Ananya Kotia's love story began just like any other college romance. Except no one else knew about the gay couple's relationship. It was 2008. Homosexuality was yet to gain a degree of acceptance in deeply conservative India, with many gay couples facing stigma and isolation. So Saxena and Kotia took their time, watching from a distance how people's acceptance of homosexuality was changing. \"We were actually quite scared about the consequences,\" said Saxena, a public policy scholar at the University of Oxford. \"We were very fragile and vulnerable, a young couple figuring out ourselves, and didn't want, you know, something as drastic as this to break us in some sense.\" Over the years, as Indian society became more accepting of homosexuality and much of the country's LGBTQ community began celebrating their sexuality openly, the couple decided to make their relationship known to their friends and family. Most of them were accepting. Now, 15 years into their relationship, they have set out for a bigger challenge and filed a petition to India's Supreme Court that seeks the legalization of same-sex marriage. Three other gay couples have filed similar petitions that will be heard by the country's top court in March. If legalized, India would become the second economy in Asia after Taiwan to recognize same-sex marriage , a significant right for the country's LGBTQ community more than four years after the top court decriminalized gay sex. A favorable ruling would also make India the biggest democracy with such rights for LGBTQ couples but run counter to the ruling Hindu nationalist government's position, which opposes same-sex marriages. \"Our relationship has been, in a social sense, undefined for so long that we would like it to now be embraced in the same way as any other couples' relationship,\" Saxena said. Legal rights for LGBTQ people in India have been expanding over the past decade, and most of these changes have come through the Supreme Court's intervention. In 2014, the court legally recognized non-binary or transgender persons as a \"third gender\" and three years later made an individual's sexual orientation an essential attribute of their privacy. The historic ruling in 2018 that struck down a colonial-era law that had made gay sex punishable by up to 10 years in prison expanded constitutional rights for the gay community. The decision was seen as a landmark victory for gay rights, with one judge saying it would \"pave the way for a better future.\" Despite this progress, legal recognition of same-sex marriage has been met with resistance by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government. In a court filing last year it said same-sex marriages would cause \"complete havoc with the delicate balance of personal laws in the country.\" Sushil Modi, a lawmaker from Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party, told Parliament in December that such marriages would be \"against the cultural ethos of the country\" and a decision on that should not be left to \"a couple of judges.\" India's Supreme Court has, however, signaled it could challenge the government's position. In January, its collegium \u2014 comprising the Chief Justice of India and two Justices \u2014 said the government was opposing a gay judge's nomination in part because of his sexual orientation. India's federal government did not respond to the allegations. Gay couples and LGBTQ activists argue that by refusing to recognize same-sex marriage, the government is depriving homosexual couples of their right to equality enshrined in the constitution and opportunities enjoyed by married heterosexual couples. \"Basically, you need to be treated the same as any other citizen. It's not special rights that are being asked for, it's just the right that every other citizen has,\" said Ruth Vanita, an expert on gender studies and author of \"Love's Rite: Same-Sex Marriage in India and the West.\" In India, marriage is governed by a set of different laws tailored to the country's religious groups, and a secular law for interfaith couples called the Special Marriage Act. All limit marriage between men and women. With no legal backing for same-sex marriages, many couples say they have faced a host of hurdles. Ruth Vanita, an expert on gender studies and author of \"Love's Rite: Same-Sex Marriage in India and the West\" adjusts books at her home in Gurgaon, India, Jan. 27, 2023. Piyush Nagpal/AP hide caption Ruth Vanita, an expert on gender studies and author of \"Love's Rite: Same-Sex Marriage in India and the West\" adjusts books at her home in Gurgaon, India, Jan. 27, 2023. Indian law restricts owning and inheriting property to LGBTQ individuals. Gay and lesbian couples are not allowed to have children born with the help of an Indian surrogate mother. And LGBTQ persons can only apply for adoption as single parents. Many such couples believe that legal recognition of same-sex marriage would not just be a vital step toward equality but also result in more people coming out as homosexuals and strengthening their relationship with the state. \"We would want the state to recognize marriage as an institution also for same-sex couples ... for acceptance at a social level,\" said Kotia, an economics scholar at the London School of Economics. Homosexuality has long carried a stigma in India's traditional society, even though there has been a shift in attitudes toward same-sex couples in recent years. India now has openly gay celebrities and some high-profile Bollywood films have dealt with gay issues. According to a Pew survey, acceptance of homosexuality in India increased by 22 percentage points to 37% between 2013 and 2019. But many same-sex couples continue to face harassment in many Indian communities, whether Hindu, Muslim or Christian. In December, India's LGBTQ community found support from an unexpected quarter. The head of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, a Hindu nationalist group that is the ideological parent of Modi's party, said LGBTQ people are \"a part of the Indian society\" and that Indian civilization has traditionally acknowledged the community. Mohan Bhagwat's comments, which could force the government to reassess its position, were a departure from the group's long-held views on homosexuality, which has a tangled history in India, even though some of Hinduism's most ancient texts are accepting of same-sex couples. \"In the West, right up to the 19th century, people were executed for same-sex relations, or they were put in prison. India has, as far as we know, no such history. We have always written about it (homosexuality), talked about it, and discussed it,\" said Vanita. Without the legal right to marriage, many LGBTQ couples have still been participating in commitment ceremonies, particularly in big cities. Such marriages are not legally binding under Indian laws, but it has not stopped them from having traditional Indian wedding rituals. Saxena and Kotia said they were planning one as well, preferably if the court rules in their favor. \"I think we would like a big wedding. Our relatives and our family and friends would like an even bigger wedding,\" Saxena said.",

    "description": "Bradley Cooper might have almost let fear get in the way of doing \u2018Place Beyond the Pines\u2019, a movie that turned out to be a very rewarding experience.",
    "content": "In 2013, Bradley Cooper starred as a police officer in one of his most critically acclaimed films Place Beyond the Pines . But the movie\u2019s content might have initially discouraged Cooper from taking the part. The Hangover was a crucial part in making Cooper the megastar he is today. To date, it\u2019s one of Cooper\u2019s most successful films, enjoying both critical and financial acclaim. But it also nearly stopped him from scoring a starring role in another well-received feature. Cooper has occasionally had some directors underestimate his acting abilities, or even question his personality due to his performances. He once had a difficult time breaking away from his image as a nice guy with no edge due to his Alias character for instance. This theme would reappear again when he was considered for the movie Place Beyond the Pines . The movie was directed by filmmaker Derek Cianfrance, who initially only saw Cooper in The Hangover . \u201cI met with a lot of great actors and someone that I was going to meet with was Bradley Cooper,\u201d Cianfrance once recalled to IndieWire . \u201cI was like, \u2018Who? The guy from The Hangover ? They\u2019re like, \u2018Yeah, he\u2019s actually a very good actor.\u2019 I was like \u2018Well, maybe he is, but I doubt he\u2019s going to be in this movie,\u2019 but I said, \u2018I\u2019ll meet with him, I\u2019ll meet with anyone.'\u201d But after meeting Cooper, he was as sold as anyone else on Cooper for the role. \u201cAs I talked to him I realized that he was my brother,\u201d Cianfrance remembered. \u201cThat he was dealing with a lot of the things that I was dealing with as a man and I thought: \u2018Wow, couldn\u2019t I make a movie with thus guy?'\u201d Cianfrance would eventually agree to hire the actor as the cop in Pines . So much so he was willing to modify the script a bit to fit Cooper more. \u201cWhy don\u2019t I rewrite the character for him and really make it about the misperception of someone that on the outside he\u2019s the hero? On the outside he\u2019s the Sexiest Man Alive but on the inside there\u2019s a corruption happening,\u201d Cianfrance said. But soon their roles would reverse. Whereas Cianfrance was all on board with Cooper, Cooper second-guessed his involvement in the project. Cianfrance theorized that Cooper\u2019s reaction to the film came out of fear. \u201cSo I rewrote it and gave it to him and there was resistance from him, he was a little scared of it I think. But I related to that in an actor too. I don\u2019t relate to the idea of no fear,\u201d Cianfrance added. The director, however, wouldn\u2019t give up on the actor even when Cooper didn\u2019t want to do the feature anymore. \u201cBut he tried to get out of it actually and I said, \u2018Where are you?\u2019 He said, \u2018I\u2019m up in Montreal shooting The Words ,\u2019 I said, \u2018Okay, it takes me about 5 hours to drive there from Brooklyn, I\u2019ll see you tonight, be there about 11,'\u201d he remembered. In a 2013 interview with Yahoo , Cooper went into a little more detail about how Cianfrance persuaded him to do Pines. Cooper confided that he hated the way the character was written when the script was first brought to him. But Cianfrance\u2019s passion eventually wore him down. \u201cHe was relentless,\u201d Cooper said about Cianfrance. \u201cAnd he was good to his word, too. He said, \u2018Look, we\u2019re going to change him. We\u2019re going to make him more human and less stock.\u2019 And he did that. I said, \u2018Okay, I trust you.\u2019 So we did it.\u201d Starring in the film was a decision Cooper was glad he made in the end. Cianfrance promised Cooper his Pines role would be a \u201cprofound experience,\u201d and Cooper quickly discovered that to be the case.",

    "description": "While this 'Real Housewives of Salt Lake City' season led to many revelations, Jen Shah's trial gave fans even more cringey moments to digest.",
    "content": "The third season of The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City has unfolded with plenty of drama to entertain fans. Most notably, Jen Shah\u2019s fall keeps fans glued to their screens. Viewers can see what led Shah to change her plea from innocent to guilty for the conspiracy to commit wire fraud as her trial ended on January 6. And Bravo fans thought this season of RHOSLC led to many revelations. But her trial gave them even more cringy moments to digest. Here are five of the big ones: As is common in celebrity trials, a lot of attention was focused on Shah\u2019s court proceedings. The courtroom was full, and reporters were there to cover all of the juicy details. Reporter Josh Russell utilized his Twitter to update the public on Shah\u2019s proceedings, which revealed a lot about the public figure. One revelation: The presiding judge, Judge Stein, addressed the courtroom regarding Shah\u2019s role on RHOSLC , stating, \u201cThe court isn\u2019t going to confuse the character that she plays on an entertainment show with the person [sitting before me in court today] \u2026 One is acting, one is \u2014 forgive me \u2014 reality.\u201d The judge went on to explain to the courtroom that RHOSLC is \u201cheavily scripted.\u201d Shah persisted in maintaining innocence for a lengthy amount of time. She was so unwavering in her innocence that she sold \u201cFree Jen\u201d and \u201cJustice for Jen\u201d merchandise . This detail did not escape Judge Stein. As Inner City Press reports, Stein directly asked Shah\u2019s attorney, \u201cIs she still selling \u2018Free Jen\u2019 and \u2018Justice for Jen\u2019 merchandise?\u201d Shah\u2019s attorney, Priya Chaudhry, responded that she was not anymore. Attorney Chaudhry tried to defend Shah, explaining, \u201cShe tried to fill the hole in her self-esteem with shiny trinkets\u201d and that her path to accepting guilt was long and twisted. Judge Stein emphasized Shah\u2019s lack of remorse by highlighting her defense binder. The former reality star focused on herself rather than the victims. The judge said, \u201cThe materials you\u2019ve given me, this binder \u2026 her personal submission to the court is only exhibit D \u2026 but there\u2019s not a word there about the victims.\u201d Judge Stein went on to accuse Shah of only acting to save herself. She stated that Shah made efforts to hide information from law enforcement rather than take responsibility for the harm she caused. RHOSLC fans are likely familiar with the catchphrase, \u201cThe only thing I\u2019m guilty of being Shah-mazing.\u201d In the intro of every Real Housewife episode, cast members state a tagline or \u201ccatchphrase.\u201d Season 2 of RHOSLC came with brand new taglines for all castmates, including Shah\u2019s cringy line. Real Housewife taglines are intended to give viewers a glimpse into the castmates\u2019 personalities and a brief preview of what viewers can expect to see as the season plays out. If fans were curious how the real housewives get their catchphrases, Shah blamed Bravo for the insensitive tagline. The disgraced star said, \u201cBut reality TV has nothing to do with reality, even my tagline, Shah-mazing \u2014 they wrote it.\u201d As Inner City Press reports, there was not a single piece of evidence showcasing Shah exhibiting remorse. There were horrifying pieces of evidence to the contrary, including Shah laughing in a text concerning an 80-year-old victim crying. Judge Stein directly addressed Shah\u2019s inability to apologize directly, saying, \u201cShe was too important to talk to the victims. She was a leader of this conspiracy. So this cuts against you, not for you.\u201d Shah\u2019s attorney responded that Shah prayed for forgiveness from her victims as she struggled to forgive herself.",

    "content": "Esther Valentine (Kate Linder) is an iconic The Young and the Restless character. For the past four decades , fans have laughed and cried alongside Esther during many bouts of Genoa City drama. Let\u2019s look at the legendary soap opera character. Linder has played the iconic Esther on The Young and the Restless for nearly 41 years. The actor made her soap opera debut on Apr. 8, 1982. The role was initially supposed to be for one day, but the producers decided to make Esther a permanent character. Esther becomes the loyal maid and friend of Katherine Chancellor (Jeanne Cooper) . The maid provided some much-needed humor whenever Genoa City was overwhelmed with drama. Although most of Esther\u2019s time was spent helping Katherine, she had her own bouts of trouble. Esther falls in love with a con man Norman Peterson, who killed Katherine\u2019s husband, Rex Sterling (Quinn Redeker). Esther also had a one-night stand with a plumber named Tiny and became pregnant. She gave birth to a daughter Kate, who was later sent to boarding school. In 2008, Kate returns, now going by the name Chloe Mitchell (Elizabeth Hendrickson), and reconnects with her mother. The past few years have been tragic for Esther. In August 2013, Esther and the rest of Genoa City mourned the death of Katherine , who died during a visit with Tucker McCall (Trevor St. John) in Hong Kong. Two months later, Esther was devastated when her granddaughter Delia Abbott (Sophie Pollono) died in a hit-and-tun accident. The Young and the Restless fans know about everything about their favorite characters. Genoa City residents are like an open book sharing details of their personal life. Yet, the character\u2019s ages remain a mystery. Many fans are curious about Esther\u2019s age, but the maid\u2019s birthdate is unknown. However, according to Soap Hub , Linder\u2019s birthday is Nov. 2, 1947, which makes her 75 years old. If one were to guess, Esther\u2019s age would be close to her portrayer\u2019s. In April 2022, Linder celebrated her 40th anniversary as Esther. However, like many of The Young and the Restless veteran characters, Esther is on a recurring basis. Although she\u2019s not featured regularly, she\u2019s a vital part of the show. These days Esther enjoys being a grandmother to her grandchildren Bella and Miles Fisher. She\u2019s also traded in her maid\u2019s uniform for a business suit. Esther as a new job as the receptionist at Chancellor-Winters. Recently, Devon Hamilton (Bryton James) and Lily Winters (Christel Khalil) have been at odds over the direction of the company. Esther is staying neutral in the situation and hopes they can work it out. But maybe it\u2019s time she imparts some words of wisdoem like her friend Katherine used to.",

    "description": "Pedro Pascal once answered rapid-fire questions including which of Nicolas Cage\u2019s long list of characters Pascal most wishes he could have played.",
    "content": "Everyone has their favorite Nicolas Cage movie, including The Last of Us star Pedro Pascal . Pascal starred with Cage in 2022\u2019s The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent before his starring role in the new mega-hit HBO show The Last of Us , one of the biggest shows on tv. Now, The Mandalorian star names the one role of Cage\u2019s he would\u2019ve loved to play . Beginning in 1996, Pascal spent nearly two decades doing small roles in film and tv (mostly billed as Pedro Balmaceda). His appearances include iconic shows like Buffy the Vampire Slayer , NYPD Blue , Law & Order , Brothers & Sisters , and Homeland . Then, in 2014, Pascal landed the role that would change his career: Oberyn Martell in Game of Thrones Season 4. Viewers will remember how his character came to an end in the series \u2014 a moment that is hard to unsee, pun intended. One year later, he became Javier Pe\u00f1a in Netflix\u2019s Narcos . In 2019, Pascal began starring in The Mandalorian . After a starring role opposite Gal Gadot in Wonder Woman 1984 as the villain, Maxwell Lord, Pascal reprised his role as the Mandalorian in another of the Star Wars franchise\u2019s series, The Book of Boba Fett . It seems only fitting that Pascal\u2019s next role was alongside Cage in a movie called The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent . As one of the best-known stars in Hollywood, Cage has played over 100 different characters including, hilariously, himself in 2022\u2019s The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent . Starring alongside Cage, Pascal stars as a Cage superfan. In an interview for the film from 2022, Pascal answers \u201cburning\u201d rapid-fire questions including which of Cage\u2019s long list of characters Pascal most wishes he could have played. \u201cIt would be Raising Arizona with the Coen Brothers, for sure,\u201d Pascal tells IMDb . He is, of course referring to one of Cage\u2019s most famous roles as H.I. McDunnough from the 1987 film that has long since become a cult classic. The film follows Cage\u2019s character H.I. and his wife, Ed (played by Holly Hunter), a childless couple who find more trouble than they imagined after kidnapping a quintuplet. The Raising Arizona cast also included John Goodman, William Forsythe, and Frances McDormand. The film remains one of Cage\u2019s most beloved films despite his expanding catalog. Interestingly, Pascal\u2019s Joel in The Last of Us has some similarities to H.I. from Raising Arizona. Based on the popular video game of the same name, The Last of Us follows Joel, a man who finds himself in an unexpectedly paternal role. Following the outbreak of the Cordyceps fungus, Joel is tasked with delivering a teenager, Ellie (Bella Ramsey), to a facility that plans to use her to create a vaccine. Though Ellie is 14 in the series (Cage\u2019s H.I. kidnapped an infant), Joel finds his work cut out for him with the sass-talking, teen. So, while he may not have gotten to play H.I. (there are no known reboots in the works for Raising Arizona , but, really, you never know), Pascal\u2019s role as Joel in The Last of Us will likely be considered among his best just as Cage\u2019s H.I. is. Oh, the unbearable weight of massive talent.",

When the ABC sitcom ended in 1995, Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen took their talents to the big screen in It Takes Two . However, fans might be shocked to learn that the mansion where the movie was filmed sat vacant for years and was recently destroyed.

The girls must use their wits to stop Roger from marrying his gold-digging fianc\u00e9e ( Jane Sibbett ) and thwart a separate plot to exploit a group of orphans like Amanda for child labor (via IMDb ). Much of the action in the Olsen twins\u2019 movie It Takes Two happens in Roger\u2019s mansion. And the film\u2019s fans would likely be surprised to learn that the real-life estate is no more. According to Talking Walls Photography , the property is located in Toronto and was built by and for real estate developer Robert Campeau. It featured 10 bedrooms, 14 bathrooms, an indoor pool, seven fireplaces, a wine cellar, a recording studio, a library, a tennis court, and even a bomb shelter. CTV News notes the mansion was a whopping 28,000 square feet. And in addition to It Takes Two , the house appeared in the Bette Midler film That Old Feeling and the Beau Bridges movie Kissinger and Nixon . However, debts from Campeau\u2019s various deals came due, forcing him to sell the house in 1990. By 2002, a married couple, Harold and Sara Springer, purchased the mansion and went to great lengths and expense to restore it. However, they put the property on the market in 2015. After five years, it found its way into the hands of a private company for $30 million. But rather than restore it, the owners demolished the mansion in 2022. Although there\u2019s not much information on why they destroyed the house, one can imagine the property taxes and upkeep would make this estate less attractive than its interior would suggest. And according to The New York Times , a foreign buyers\u2019 tax in Canada could have added $5 million or more to the final purchase price for any potential non-Canadian buyer. It Takes Two did not fare well critically or commercially, but the Olsen twins\u2019 career post-1995 is in a far better state than Campeau\u2019s mansion. In the late \u201990s, they made guest appearances on TV shows like All My Children in 1996 and Sister, Sister in 1997. The following year, Mary-Kate and Ashley starred in the short-lived sitcom Two of a Kind . They also continued making movies as a duo in a string of family comedies. They include Passport to Paris (1999), Our Lips Are Sealed (2000), Winning London (2001), When in Rome (2002), and New York Minute (2004). However, in the early 2000s, the twins began leveraging their celebrity and production company, Dualstar, to sell products that appealed to teens. They also began pursuing fashion design by starring in ad campaigns for brands like Badgley Mischka, introducing their own girls\u2019 clothing line, and founding a fashion house. With their acting appearances becoming more sporadic over the first decade of the 2000s, the twins finally called it quits in 2012 . They indicated they wanted to focus on their fashion careers, which had quickly become highly successful. Not even Fuller House \u2014 the 2015 Full House reboot with the original cast \u2014 could get the siblings to return to acting, a disappointment to longtime fans. However, the Olsen twins have launched a successful second act , winning multiple fashion industry awards and selling millions of dollars in merchandise yearly through their fashion house, The Row.",

    "content": "A body language expert shared his analysis of the moment in the Meghan Markle and Prince Harry Netflix documentary when Meghan cried. Was it real emotion or was she acting? In the documentary Harry & Meghan , the Sussexes shared their experiences about life in the royal family. At one point, Meghan explained what it felt like when bad press prompted death threats on social media. \u201cJust a couple of days ago, I was going through the manual for our security team at home, and on one of the pages that I happened to flip to, it was about online monitoring,\u201d she continued. \u201cAnd they\u2019re like: \u2018If you see a tweet like this, please report it to the head of security immediately.\u2019 It just said: \u2018Meghan just needs to die. Someone needs to kill her. Maybe it should be me.\u2019\u201d She added, \u201cAnd I was just like, OK.\u2019 That\u2019s, like, what\u2019s actually out in the world because of people creating hate.\u201d Meghan broke down in tears as she recalled how scary it was that people wanted her dead. \u201cAnd I\u2019m a mom. That\u2019s my real life. And that\u2019s the piece when you see it and you go, \u2018You are making people want to kill me. It\u2019s not just a tabloid. It\u2019s not just some story,\u201d she explained. \u201cYou are making me scared. Right?\u201d Meghan continued, \u201cThat night, to be up and down in the middle of the night, looking down my hallway, like, \u2018Are we safe? Are the doors locked? Is security on?\u2019 Is every \u2014 that\u2019s real. \u2018Are my babies safe?\u2019\u201d She added, \u201cAnd you\u2019ve created it for what? Because you\u2019re bored or because it sells your papers or it makes you feel better about your own life? It\u2019s real what you\u2019re doing. And that\u2019s the piece I don\u2019t think people fully understand.\u201d In a video for The Behavioral Arts YouTube channel, body language expert Spidey shared his analysis of what he called \u201cthe most polarizing clip in the entire documentary.\u201d He noted how people either don\u2019t like her and think that she\u2019s \u201cfake\u201d or they do like her and support her. \u201cI think those who don\u2019t like Meghan are looking at this going, \u2018I can\u2019t believe anybody would buy this, it just looks so fake,'\u201d Spidey explained. \u201cAnd I think those who support Meghan are looking at this exact same clip, going, \u2018I can\u2019t believe anybody would doubt this. Look at her, she\u2019s falling apart, she\u2019s so emotional.\u2019\u201d The body language expert noted how there are arguments for either side. \u201cThere are things here that look and feel real and there are things here that look and feel fabricated,\u201d he said. \u201cSo what you focus on is how you\u2019re going to interpret the entire thing. It depends on the goggles that you\u2019re putting on.\u201d He pointed out Meghan\u2019s \u201cdramatic pauses and that emphasis\u201d when she speaks that look put on. \u201cOn other hand, we\u2019re seeing little bursts here of sadness that we haven\u2019t seen in other overly dramatic scenes that she has,\u201d Spidey explained. Meghan\u2019s eyebrows come together and up, but he said \u201cit\u2019s hard to know if that\u2019s real sadness.\u201d Spidey went on to look at how Meghan was moved to tears and discussed whether that was her acting or if she was showing real emotion. \u201cMeghan is not an exceptional actor. She\u2019s not an Oscar-winning actor,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s a good actress, she\u2019s good at what she does, but I\u2019ve never seen anything from her that made me go, \u2018Oh my god, wow, performance of the century.'\u201d He also pointed out how she \u201crandomly\u201d says \u201cI\u2019m a mom,\u201d which he perceived as \u201ca call for sympathy.\u201d Meghan\u2019s voice quivered and trembled while she was recalling the terrifying death threats, which also could point to real emotion. \u201cYou could be a great actor \u2014 that\u2019s not something that\u2019s really easy to fake,\u201d Spidey said. \u201cSo is it real, is it fake?\u201d he asked. \u201cI think it depends on the goggles you have on .\u201d The expert added, \u201cAs for me, my position on this is the following: I absolutely think that there was a real fear there when she saw the death threats. I believe there was a real fear, I believe there was a real sadness\u2026 I think the base of it is real but she\u2019s throwing some sprinkles on top and really trying to sell how emotional this is.\u201d Showbiz Cheat Sheet acknowledges conditions and cultures can impact body language and is sensitive to all backgrounds.",

    "description": "Samuel L. Jackson enjoys being able to choose the type of hair he has in movies, so he might not have appreciated a director taking that freedom away from him.",
    "content": "Samuel L. Jackson has sported a variety of hairstyles in his movies, from Pulp Fiction to Unbreakable . But there was one unnamed filmmaker who tried to restrict the hairdo Jackson wore in a movie. Jackson often chooses his hairstyle for the characters that he portrays in movies. Occasionally the actor would feel a certain hairdo would fit a particular role, while also telling audiences a bit more about his character\u2019s story. In the M. Night Shyamalan film Unbreakable , for instance, Jackson portrays a genius with hints of mental instability. Both Shyamalan and Jackson agreed that a disheveled look for Jackson\u2019s hair would be best for his Unbreakable counterpart. \u201cI was thinking Frederick Douglass,\u201d he once said according to LA Times about his character\u2019s hair. \u201cIt informed my character very well because he\u2019s a thinker.\u201d But one of Jackson\u2019s most cherished hairstyles was the hair he wore for Jackie Brown . If only because of his hair\u2019s flexibility at the time he was filming Quentin Tarantino\u2019s Elmore Leonard adaptation. \u201cI could wear it straight down or I could tie a French braid in the back or I could rock a ponytail,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cHe\u2019s trying to be this elegant Super Fly -kind of guy \u2014 Super Fly is his favorite movie and that\u2019s what Ron O\u2019Neal\u2019s hair looked like.\u201d In the 2008 sci-fi feature Jumper , Jackson wears another interesting hairdo. His hair is dyed white for the entirety of the film, which was a suggestion Jackson made for his character Roland Cox. In an old interview he did with Black Film , Jackson confided that his hairstyle for the film was partially inspired by comic books. \u201cWhen [ Jumper director Doug Liman] and I talked about it in a comic book sense, and I read comics most of the time,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cI\u2019ve been reading comics since I was a kid and most characters in comics are very distinct. They have a look of some sort. I think Roland is sort of ageless in a way. We don\u2019t know how old he is and that gives him a sense of gravitas in a way, but he\u2019s also strong and principled. It also makes him distinctive. That\u2019s all. No big deal.\u201d In the interview, the Far From Home star also revealed he recommends most of his movie hairstyles. However, he did come across one filmmaker who might not have offered Jackson the freedom he enjoyed when it came to his on-screen hair. \u201cI have only had one director who had a mandate for my hair and I don\u2019t work [with] him anymore,\u201d he said. It takes a lot of work to get an actor\u2019s hair ready for film. It often requires the expertise of a passionate hair specialist to complete the job right. Robert L. Stevenson is a hair stylist who\u2019s worked on the hairdos of many celebrities in the film industry, including Jackson\u2019s. When Jackson was concerned he wasn\u2019t holding onto his hair, Jackson questioned Stevenson if simply going bald would\u2019ve been a viable option. \u201cHe was losing his hair at one point and said, \u2018If I just shaved it all off could we still create looks with wigs ?'\u201d Stevenson said in a 2014 interview with Deadline . \u201cI said, \u2018Sam, we can basically do anything with wigs.\u2019 That\u2019s when we started getting into it.\u201d",

    "description": "Looking to buy an air fryer? Before you do, check out our Homes writer\u2019s top air fryer tips and what you need to know.",
    "content": "As a Homes writer, I\u2019ve tried and tested all kinds of small appliances over the years. From juicers and stand mixers to vacuum cleaners, I\u2019ve reviewed my fair share \u2014 but my favorite appliance (so far) has got to be the air fryer. Air fryers have become the must-have appliance in recent years, known for rustling up crispy, delicious foods in no time. Not only can air fryers cook crunchy foods quickly using little or no oil, but they are also known to be slightly cheaper to run than a standard oven , saving you money on bills. After owning my small one for almost two years , I\u2019ve learned all sorts of pros and cons when cooking with an air fryer . And while they are incredibly versatile in preparing tasty recipes , there are also 9 things you should never put in an air fryer to avoid a culinary disaster! So, before you rush out to buy one of the best air fryers for your home, here are my top air fryer tips to get the most out of it. Although it\u2019s tempting to throw everything in at once, don\u2019t overcrowd the basket. Always distribute foods evenly in the base to allow the heat to evenly cook the foods. If your basket is overcrowded, this could block the hot air from circulating around the food properly, resulting in undercooked (or overcooked) foods. What\u2019s more, if you fill it too much, the top of your food could end up pressing against the heating element, which can cause a potential fire hazard. Choose an air fryer with a suitable capacity for your needs, or purchase an air fryer with two baskets that will allow you to cook multiple things at once. Air fryers like this Ninja DZ201 Foodi 8 Quart 6-in-1 DualZone 2-Basket Air Fryer ( $159, Amazon (opens in new tab) ), are more suitable for big families. Another thing I\u2019ve learned is that air fryers heat up very quickly, and retain their hot temperature longer. Since this often speeds up the cooking process, it can also result in overcooked foods \u2014 even at the recommended cooking time on packaging. If you want to avoid dried-out overcooked foods, take note of timings, and adjust your recipe temperatures where necessary. In addition, try not to leave high-heat foods inside the fryer for too long, as this will essentially \u2018cook\u2019 your food even more if left for a long period. Similarly, if you forget to preheat most air fryers, this may result in undercooked foods. In any case, each air fryer model/brand varies, so be sure to read the manual, and stick to what air fryer recipes they have suggested. Air fryers offer a low-fat alternative to deep or shallow frying, and need little to no oil. In fact, one mistake I made when I first bought mine was to use too much oil, which ended up with oily (and inedible) results! It\u2019s worth noting that most deep-fried recipes need up to 3 cups (750 mL) of oil, air-fried foods would only need about 1 tablespoon (15 mL) in comparison. I would recommend using a spray bottle like this Oil Sprayer for Cooking ( $12, Amazon (opens in new tab) ), making it easier to lightly spray the oil, without oversaturating foods. And while there is much debate about whether air fryers are actually healthy , these handy appliances are certainly a \u2018healthier\u2019 alternative to deep frying. Another useful tip to remember is to always check your food. Most recipes in an air fryer will need turning halfway through the cooking process to ensure foods are evenly cooked and crispy all over. The good thing about air fryers is that you can open the basket during the process without worrying about losing heat. This is because an air fryer is essentially a mini convection oven, and will heat itself continuously. When turning over or removing foods, always use a suitable utensil or heatproof tongs like these 2 Pack Black Kitchen Tongs, ( $7, Amazon (opens in new tab) ), as the basket gets very hot. Compared to traditional frying, air fryers are a lot easier to clean than a grease-laden pan. Plus, who wants the task of disposing of cooking oil each time? However, it\u2019s always a good idea to clean your air fryer thoroughly after each use. This is down to the fact that any oil residue or crumbs that fall through to the bottom of the basket can burn with continuous use. Not only will this affect the overall performance of the appliance, but might create smoke in your kitchen. To prevent this from happening, check out how to clean an air fryer for best results. If you\u2019re new to the world of air frying, check out how to use an air fryer, and avoid these common air fryer mistakes . More importantly, read about how to stop your air fryer from overheating since it could be a potential fire hazard, and here\u2019s why our Homes Editor would buy an air fryer over a toaster oven any day.",

So far, prosecutors had pieces of evidence in the \u201cthree-digit range\u201d, he added, without elaborating. Reuters also reported that Ukraine and its western allies have accused Russian forces of committing atrocities in Bucha, a satellite town of Kyiv, soon after launching their invasion last February. Moscow has denied the charge. Russia has also targeted key infrastructure in Ukraine but denies deliberately targeting civilians. Germany began collecting evidence in March 2022 to prosecute possible war crimes, including by interviewing Ukrainian refugees and evaluating publicly available information, Frank said, adding that German prosecutors were not yet investigating specific individuals. .css-cumn2r{height:1em;width:1.5em;margin-right:3px;vertical-align:baseline;fill:#C70000;} We are preparing ourselves for a possible later court case \u2013 be it with us in Germany, be it with our foreign partners, be it before an international court.

In an interview with BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme on Saturday morning, the former senior figure under Trump compared the current buildup of tensions between the US and China to that of the US and Russia before the invasion of Ukraine . \u201cWe know how to deter our adversaries. Frankly, the Trump administration did it. Vladimir Putin did not invade Europe or Ukraine on our watch. \u201cThis is an unprovoked attack on Europe by Vladimir Putin. He is solely responsible for that. But these things don\u2019t happen in a vacuum. Adversaries make decisions about when, Vladimir Putin has always wanted greater Russia . He will go to his grave wanting greater Russia,\u201d he said. The former head of the CIA is mulling over running to become US president at the next election. He was on Today promoting his new book, Never Give An Inch: Fighting for the America I Love. He added: \u201cHere\u2019s some facts, Vladimir Putin took a fifth of Ukraine under President Obama in 2014. For four years he didn\u2019t take an inch of Ukraine, he fought along the Donbas, but he didn\u2019t invade. Then when we left he went after it again. That\u2019s indisputable, those are factual statements. You can argue coincidence or luck, but Vladimir Putin didn\u2019t change. His intentions didn\u2019t change.

They say another 720 were killed on Friday, bringing the total to 130,590. Ukrainian forces took out another six armoured personnel vehicles, three tanks and three anti-aircraft systems. The figures , published by the general staff of the armed forces of Ukraine, have not been independently verified, and Russian statistics differ.

The money would come from assets confiscated from Russian oligarch Konstantin Malofeyev after his April indictment for alleged sanctions evasions, he added. The money would go to the state department \u201cto support the people of Ukraine\u201d, CNN reported Garland as saying. Merrick Garland, second left, with Andriy Kostin in Washington on Friday.

Russian millionaire Malofeyev is considered one of the main sources of funding for pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine. In April, the US Treasury blacklisted a network of about 40 individuals and entities led by Malofeyev which it alleged were used to facilitate sanctions evasion. Updated at 04.22 EST 2h ago 02.46 EST There has been no let-up in fighting in Bakhmut, the front line of a continuing battle between Ukrainian and Russian forces. Throughout Friday morning Agence France-Presse journalists heard a steady exchange of small-arms fire and the pounding of mortar shells to and from Russian positions, the agency reported. Pete Reed , a US humanitarian medic, was killed in the eastern Ukraine city when his evacuation vehicle was hit by a missile, according to Global Outreach Doctors, with whom he was working. Reed was a former US Marine Corps rifleman who also worked as a paramedic, according to the organisation\u2019s founder, Andrew Lustig . Several other people were reportedly hurt in the strike. A local man, Oleksandr Tkachenko , 65, said it was \u201cclear\u201d that the car, which was destroyed, was not a military target.

The European Commission chief, Ursula von der Leyen , who is visiting Kyiv, said on Thursday that an international centre for the prosecution of the crime of aggression in Ukraine would be set up in The Hague, Reuters reported. Moscow rejects the war crimes allegations. 3h ago 02.18 EST Germany has war crimes evidence in 'three-digit range', says prosecutor Germany has collected evidence of war crimes in Ukraine , the country\u2019s prosecutor general said in a newspaper interview published on Saturday, adding that he saw a need for a judicial process at international level. \u201cCurrently, for example, we are focusing on the mass killings in Bucha or attacks against Ukrainian civilian infrastructure,\u201d Peter Frank told the Welt am Sonntag newspaper. So far, prosecutors had pieces of evidence in the \u201cthree-digit range\u201d, he added, without elaborating. Reuters also reported that Ukraine and its western allies have accused Russian forces of committing atrocities in Bucha, a satellite town of Kyiv, soon after launching their invasion last February. Moscow has denied the charge. Russia has also targeted key infrastructure in Ukraine but denies deliberately targeting civilians. Germany began collecting evidence in March 2022 to prosecute possible war crimes, including by interviewing Ukrainian refugees and evaluating publicly available information, Frank said, adding that German prosecutors were not yet investigating specific individuals. .css-cumn2r{height:1em;width:1.5em;margin-right:3px;vertical-align:baseline;fill:#C70000;} We are preparing ourselves for a possible later court case \u2013 be it with us in Germany, be it with our foreign partners, be it before an international court.

Ukraine is pushing for the creation of a special tribunal to prosecute Russian military and political leaders it holds responsible for starting the war. Updated at 04.23 EST 3h ago 02.00 EST Opening summary Hello and welcome back to the Guardian\u2019s ongoing live coverage of Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine \u2013 this is Adam Fulton. Germany has collected evidence of war crimes in Ukraine , the German prosecutor general says, and the pieces of evidence are in the \u201cthree-digit range\u201d. Peter Frank told the Welt am Sonntag newspaper that he saw a need for a judicial process at an international level. \u201cCurrently, for example, we are focusing on the mass killings in Bucha or attacks against Ukrainian civilian infrastructure,\u201d he said in an interview published on Saturday. More on that story soon. The United States, meanwhile, has announced a new $2.2bn (\u00a31.8bn) military aid package for Ukraine that Washington says includes precision-guided rockets and Hawk air defence firing units. It also includes, for the first time, a rocket-powered ground launched small diameter bomb that is said to double Ukraine\u2019s strike range and enable its military to strike deep behind the frontlines of the war. In other developments as it turns 9am in Kyiv: Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said Ukraine will continue to fight for Bakhmut as long as it can, vowing that \u201cnobody will give away\u201d the eastern \u201cfortress\u201d city . Speaking at a press conference following a summit in Kyiv with European Union leaders Ursula von der Leyen and Charles Michel, Ukraine\u2019s president said the country would be able to begin to liberate occupied Donbas if weapons supplies were \u201cquickened, specifically long-range weapons\u201d. EU leaders offered strong support for Ukraine but set \u201cno rigid timelines\u201d for its accession to the bloc. Zelenskiy had hoped the EU would put Ukraine on a rapid track to membership, but western EU member states are concerned that Kyiv\u2019s expectations on speedy membership talks are unrealistic. Air raid sirens twice sounded across Ukraine on Friday as Zelenskiy hosted the EU leaders in Kyiv. The first air alert in Kyiv was on Friday morning. The second , hours later, followed a joint news conference involving Zelenskiy, von der Leyen and Charles Michel. There were no immediate reports of any Russian airstrikes on Kyiv throughout the day. EU member countries have agreed on a European Commission proposal to set price caps on Russian oil products, the Swedish presidency of the EU said. Ambassadors of the 27 EU states agreed at a meeting on Friday to impose a $100-a-barrel cap on premium products such as diesel and a $45 cap on low-end products, according to diplomats. The price cap comes into effect on Sunday, as does the EU\u2019s ban on Russian oil product imports. The EU has promised that a tenth package of sanctions against Russia will be in place by 24 February, the first anniversary of the war. The EC president, Ursula von der Leyen, said the package would cover trade worth \u20ac10bn ( \u00a3 8.9bn/$10.8bn) and \u201chit the trade and technology that supports [Russia\u2019s] war against Ukraine\u201d. An American medic has been killed while working on the frontlines in Ukraine , just weeks after arriving in the country. Pete Reed, 34, was killed on Thursday while he was helping evacuate civilians when his vehicle was reportedly hit by a missile in Bakhmut. A woman walks on a destroyed bridge in Bakhmut. Photograph: Yasuyoshi Chiba/AFP/Getty Images France and Italy have finalised technical talks for the joint delivery of the Samp/T air defence system to Ukraine this spring , the French defence ministry has announced. It comes after Italy\u2019s foreign minister, Antonio Tajani, said on Thursday that the system would be operational in Ukraine \u201cwithin seven to eight weeks\u201d. The system can track dozens of targets and intercept 10 at once. It is the only European-made system that can intercept ballistic missiles. The EU will launch a humanitarian de-mining programme in Ukraine worth \u20ac25m , the bloc\u2019s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, has confirmed , saying de-mining was \u201ccrucial to save the lives of civilian population\u201d. New tanks supplied by Nato allies will serve as an \u201ciron fist\u201d in a counteroffensive by Kyiv to break through Russian defensive lines, Ukraine\u2019s defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov, has said. Western supplies of 155-mm artillery would be vital for Ukraine to deter Russian attacks in the south and in the east, Reznikov said at a joint news conference with his Polish counterpart, Mariusz B\u0142aszczak. Germany has approved the export of older Leopard 1 battle tanks, which would add to the raft of fighting vehicles Berlin promised last week. A spokesperson said Olaf Scholz\u2019s government had granted an export licence for the German-made tanks first produced in the 1960s and replaced within Germany\u2019s own military by Leopard 2 tanks in 2003.

Harington, who starred as Jon Snow in the hit HBO series, announced the exciting news of their impending arrival Friday on \u201cThe Tonight Show starring Jimmy Fallon.\u201d Harington and Leslie, known for her role as Ygritte on the HBO fantasy series, welcomed their first child \u2014 a baby boy \u2014 in early 2021. Speaking about his two-year-old son, Harington told host Jimmy Fallon their son is \u201cabout to get the shock of his life\u201d as he\u2019s set to \u201cget a brother or sister.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m terrified,\u201d Harington admitted. \u201cWith the first baby you\u2019re like walking through clouds and dancing through fields of daisies for 9 months, well \u2014 the man is anyway.\u201d Harington admits that the second time around, \u201cthe reality check comes much shorter. You get practical real quick.\u201d When asked what his son thinks about the new baby, Harington admits he hasn\u2019t \u201cconceptually understood it just yet.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re trying to get him ready for it, we point to Rose\u2019s tummy and we say, \u2018Mommy\u2019s baby.\u2019 And he points at his tummy and says, \u2018My baby,\u201d Harington said. In September 2020, Leslie, 35, confirmed that she and Harington, 36, had a baby on the way . Her pregnancy was revealed by the UK\u2019s Make magazine when the actress debuted her baby bump on the cover. Leslie spoke about impending parenthood to The Post in October 2020, saying she was \u201cthrilled to be expecting.\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t wait to meet the new member of our family,\u201d she said at the time. Leslie starred opposite her now-husband on \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d from 2012 to 2014. The couple made their red carpet debut in 2016 at the Olivier Awards in London and confirmed their engagement in a newspaper announcement in 2017.

    "content": "LANGHORNE, Pennsylvania (WPVI) -- Eagles fans took over Oxford Valley Mall in Langhorne, Bucks County on Saturday as four members of the Super Bowl-bound team showed up to sign autographs. Boston Scott, CJ Gardner-Johnson, Kenneth Gainwell and Quez Watkins all came to the mall to greet hundreds of fans who bought tickets for the chance to meet the players before they leave for the big game. Some of those fans are confident in the Eagles' chances next week. \"Just because of the way they've been clicking all year and pretty much dominating, it's been pretty fun to watch,\" said Jim Flattery from Levittown. He and his family got to the mall at 10 a.m., three hours before the players were scheduled to arrive. \"We did in 2017 when the Eagles made it to the Super Bowl and I knew it was going to be pretty packed, so we wanted to get here early again,\" said Flattery, who was the first of about 600 fans in line. \"We have a great relationship with the Eagles, so usually when we do these type of events, they're always on board. We take care of the athletes, they take care of us, and ultimately the fans win,\" said James Williams, the president of Dynastery Sports, a business in the mall which organized the event. RELATED: A Philly home will be a house divided when Eagles face Chiefs in the Super Bowl With so many high-profile names, diehard Eagles fans came out in full force, some showing off just how dedicated they are to the Birds. Eagles superfan Will Roller had the entire 2018 team tattooed on his back. He arrived shirtless to show off his ink to the team. He told them if they win next weekend, he'll get them tattooed on his stomach. As the Eagles stars took in the mania, players said it means a lot to see just how much the fan base cares. \"It's nuts, man. I'm not surprised though. They've always supported us throughout the years and especially this season, so seeing them here is amazing,\" said running back Boston Scott, who added he thinks this team can bring home another Lombardi trophy. \"Why not do the thing?\" he asked. We made it this far so might as well finish it.\"",

The dots had been installed to prevent sideshow activity on Wednesday, according to the Alameda County Sheriff\u2019s Office. On Wednesday, the sheriff\u2019s office announced that the Botts Dots had been installed at two intersections in San Lorenzo. The first dots were placed at Via Lucas and Via Chiquita, and the next set were installed at Via Manzanas and Via Chiquita, according to the sheriff\u2019s office. On Saturday, an Instagram page posted a video of a white Cadillac spinning donuts at one of the intersections. The tires can be seen spinning over the dots, which appear to do little to stop the activity. A second video on the page shows the dots with burned rubber marks across the top. The sheriff\u2019s office says that more dots will be installed at additional intersections that have reported sideshow activity sometime soon. The installations were a group effort by the sheriff\u2019s office, California Highway Patrol and elected officials, including Alameda County Supervisors Nate Miley and Lena Tam.",

    "content": "Americans on Saturday reporting seeing the large Chinese balloon suspected of conducting surveillance as it drifted over the Southern U.S. Hours later, it was shot out of the sky over the Atlantic Ocean. TV footage showed the moment the balloon appeared to be hit and began its descent toward the water. The balloon was downed after it passed into U.S. territorial waters, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said in a statement. It carried a large payload of spy gear according to U.S. officials, and had soared over several strategic sites, including nuclear missile silos as it crossed a huge swath of the U.S. Earlier in the day, people had used cell phones and professional cameras to document the balloon's trajectory. The balloon was spotted over Montana earlier this week. UPDATES: US downs suspected Chinese spy balloon off Carolina coast More: Blinken postpones China trip amid spy balloon row; US officials scramble to get rid of it More: Surveillance, research, civilian use? What the Chinese balloon is and how the U.S. can bring it down Video shows Chinese balloon being shot down Footage on TV and captured by onlookers appears to show aircraft over the Atlantic firing at the spy balloon. After a small explosion, debris could be seen slowly floating down toward the ocean. U.S. military jets were seen flying in the vicinity and ships were deployed in the water to mount the recovery operation. Senior Pentagon officials briefing reporters on the condition of anonymity said F-22 warplanes from Virginia and F-15s from Massachusetts were scrambled to down the balloon after it passed the coastline of South Carolina. A single AIM 9X sidewinder air-to-air missile was fired and struck the balloon at 2:39 p.m. EDT, officials said. WATCH: US jets shoot down suspected Chinese spy balloon The debris landed in about 47 feet of water, a relatively shallow site that a salvage ship and divers will investigate in the coming days. Debris could scatter over about a 7 mile radius. No people or vessels were struck. What was the Chinese balloon doing? The balloon was a \"high-altitude surveillance balloon,\" Air Force Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder, the Pentagon press secretary, said. China has maintained it was a weather research \"airship\" that went off course, but that has been rejected by U.S. officials. It's not the first time China has tried to collect sensitive information, Ryder said. \u201cInstances of this kind of balloon activity have been observed previously over the past several years, Ryder said. \u201cOnce the balloon was detected, the U.S. government acted immediately to protect against the collection of sensitive information.\u201d The Pentagon also acknowledged reports of a second balloon flying over Latin America. Where did people see the balloon? The balloon was spotted Saturday floating east over the Carolinas, headed toward the Atlantic Ocean. Evan Fisher, an atmospheric sciences major at the University of North Carolina at Asheville, photographed what he said was a \"surprisingly large\" balloon just before 9 a.m. Saturday. He used a professional camera with a zoom lens to capture detail on the balloon. \"I'm used to weather balloons, I'm a meteorologist, so I'm familiar with 12- to 18-foot-wide balloons, but the fact that this thing is three school buses wide just just blew me away,\" Fisher told USA TODAY. Amy Ostrosky, who works in digital marketing and lives in Cornelius, about 20 miles north of Charlotte, said she and several neighbors ran outside to spot what they thought was the balloon Saturday morning. It looked like a bright star in the sky, but bigger, she said. Ostrosky said the whole ordeal made her uneasy: \"What is it for? What\u2019s it doing? Why is it here?\" Contributing: Tom Vanden Brook, Josh Meyer and Maureen Groppe, USA TODAY; The Associated Press",

Later this month, the curtains will be pulled back for the public to see the latest \"up-powered,\" \"magnum\" \"hypersleds\" built for \"astonishing power\" and \"blistering speed,\" according to a mix of recent media. \"It's crazy how year after year these sleds continue to get faster and better,\" said Ben Roth of CBoysTV, a highly successful YouTube channel based in rural Becker County. \"All the manufacturers are basically making rocket ships with tracks and skis on them.\" But Roth, who performs crazy stunts with off-road vehicles of all kinds, agrees with many others who say advances in snowmobile design and engineering aren't to blame for the rash of fatal accidents this winter in Minnesota and Wisconsin. To the contrary, they say, the $23,000 turbo-charged sleds of today feature far better braking, steering and maneuverability than models produced 25 years ago that had just as much top-end speed. Law enforcement officials agree. Then, as now, the prime underpinnings of deadly crashes are alcohol, inexperience and speeding out of control, they say. Any of those factors can contribute to striking a tree or other fixed object \u2014 the most common ending for people who die on snowmobile rides. \"Those are the leading causes,\" said Capt. Jon Paurus, who heads safety training for Minnesota's Department of Natural Resources. \"My team goes through the crash reports \u2026 There's no (new) visible trends.\" Mark Lester of Muskoka, Ontario, is president of Supertrax Media Inc., producer of Snowtrax television and Supertrax magazine. He relishes the need-for-speed culture of snowmobiling and continues to be amazed by the industry's advances in acceleration, power, handling and comfort. When the industry's first big-motor muscle sleds were hitting the trails in the late 1980s and early 1990s, he said, riders were streaking across frozen lakes at speeds of 110 mph. People started asking if the machines were too powerful, too dangerous, Lester recalls. His stock answer hasn't changed. \"People don't need a big-inch motor to kill themselves. The number one contributor is impairment,\" he said. \"People get killed riding snowmobiles by riding irresponsibly.\" Before January's three-day holiday weekend honoring Martin Luther King Jr., snowmobilers received public safety reminders from DNR officials in Minnesota and Wisconsin. By then, six riders had died in Minnesota crashes this season \u2014 the same number as the entire 2021-22 snowmobile season and double the number of the 2020-21 season. A seventh rider died on Jan. 22, 20 miles northeast of Detroit Lakes. Then, within the past week, a 67-year-old resort owner was found dead next to a crashed snowmobile in Kandiyohi County. In Wisconsin, a state with more snowmobile trails and more registered sleds than in Minnesota, nine riders have died in the past three weeks. Too many alcohol test results are still pending in the two states to estimate impairment in this season's accidents. But according to completed accident reports from 2021 in Wisconsin, alcohol was involved in nine of 13 snowmobile fatalities, or 70%. In Minnesota, alcohol was a recorded factor in 11 of 19 (58%) fatal snowmobile accidents from late 2018 to March 2020. Lt. Jacob Holsclaw, a Wisconsin DNR conservation warden and the agency's off-highway vehicle administrator, said the biggest and most obvious multiplier when it comes to snowmobile deaths per season is ample snowfall increasing ridership. Alcohol impairment has been an enduring problem in a high percentage of those crashes, he said. \"A lot of your sleds today are getting more powerful, but they handle better,\" he said. \"The stability seems better.\" Even when compared to ATV fatalities, Holsclaw said, alcohol impairment seems more prevalent in snowmobile crashes. \"We do tend to see a little more alcohol use on the snowmobile side,\" he said. Holsclaw and Paurus said mandatory safety training for snowmobile riders has coincided with a long-term, downward trend in snowmobiling deaths. But crash reports are still rife with evidence that riders don't always obtain safety certification. David Fischer, a pro snowmobile racer who has a contract with Polaris, has been around fast sleds all his life. During most winters, he'll travel out west to ride in the mountains \u2014 an experience he is skipping this year because of amazing snow conditions in Minnesota. He recently rode trails from Grand Marais all the way home to the north metro area, he said. What he views as a lasting safety problem, besides alcohol, is inexperience. A familiar narrative in fatal accident reports is that of a rider failing to negotiate a turn and colliding into a tree or other fixed object. Fischer said today's fastest stock snowmobiles bury the old models with quicker acceleration, not all-out speed. They also provide ergonomic comforts that keep you riding all day. \"The sleds work with you rather than against you,\" he said. Greatly reduced in weight and refined with ever-more-responsive frames and shock absorbers, the machines provide for riders the thrill of leaning into corners and the pull of horsepower coming out of turns. Rolling along at reasonable speeds, late-model, two-stroke snowmobiles can also pop wheelies nowadays with a flick of the throttle. It's the same \"bottomless pit of torque\" described joyously by Thompson riding his Ducati. \"Some people will tell you that slow is good \u2014 and it may be, on some days,\" he wrote. \"but I am here to tell you that fast is better.\" Lester of Supertrax acknowledged that snowmobilers care mightily about how fast and how hard their machines accelerate. But that's not a bad thing with constant advancements in design, he said. \"What we have today,\" he said, \"is the highest form of the species.\"",

    "content": "A boy with a hankering for chili cheese fries and pepperoni pizza is in big trouble after he used his dad's phone to order $1,500 of his favorite foods. Six-year-old Mason Stonehouse, of Chesterfield, Michigan, ordered enough food to feed a Super Bowl party while he was supposed to be using an educational app on his father's phone just before bedtime Saturday. Mason picked his favorite foods from his family's favorite restaurants, putting in five orders of jumbo shrimp, 12 orders of chili cheese fries, $400 worth of pepperoni pizza and 16 scoops of ice cream, his father, Keith Stonehouse, told USA TODAY. Stonehouse said Mason's mischief happened on the one night a month his mother, Kristin, goes out with the girls. Stonehouse was putting Mason to bed when headlights flooded his boy's bedroom and the doorbell rang. Stonehouse opened the front door to find a giant bag of takeout. Thinking Kristin ordered the goodies for her and her friends to eat when they got home, Stonehouse didn't think much of it. \"All of a sudden, ding dong,\" Stonehouse said. \"And I see more lights coming into the house and it's another giant bag of food. I take it into the kitchen, then ding dong. ... And it just keeps happening, and cars are pulling in while others are pulling out.\" That's when it hit Stonehouse. Mason had been using his phone just before bed. He tracked down the device and saw a flood of notifications telling him his food was being prepared, on its way or had been delivered. There was one fraud notification on the $400 pizza order. 'Are the pepperoni pizzas here yet?' Stonehouse said he began yelling at his son when Mason stopped him. \"He puts his hands up and very matter-of-fact says: 'Dad, Dad, Dad. One question,'\" Stonehouse said. \"I said, 'What?' He said, 'Are the pepperoni pizzas here yet?'\" In all, Mason had ordered $1,500 worth of food, about $1,000 of which arrived because of fraudulent holds on Stonehouse's card. Because Kristin Stonehouse runs a bakery out of the house, the family has four refrigerators that were able to hold the feast. Mason also tipped the drivers 25%, on a night when the temperatures fell to 6 degrees, Stonehouse said. As punishment, Mason hasn't been allowed to eat any of the food and doesn't get phone privileges. His parents also taught him a lesson by making him pay for a fraction of the damage with his piggy bank money. 'Grubhub Boy' It's not all bad news for Mason, though. Grubhub's chief operating officer and the head of marketing reached out to the family and gave them a $1,000 gift card. The family also has done dozens of interviews, including with \"Good Morning America\" and \"Today.\" Stonehouse said they're trying to keep Mason away from some of the hoopla, but he already has become a celebrity at school. \"Everyone at school is calling him Grubhub Boy,\" he said. \"And so now he's looking on our TV \u2013 he can use voice on the remote \u2013 'Grubhub Boy' and it's coming up on every YouTube thing and I'm like, 'Oh, God, here we go.' \"It\u2019s the twilight zone.\" More coverage from USA TODAY Drug, blood pressure medication recalls: Search our database for a full list of FDA recalls since 2012 Debt ceiling fight: How Medicare and Social Security benefits factor into the Kevin McCarthy debt ceiling fight Summer flights: Frontier introduces new summer pass, offering nearly unlimited flights for $399 'It makes you feel bad': People are getting sick of being asked for tips everywhere they go",

    "content": "The Cowboys have hired Brian Schottenheimer as their new offensive coordinator the team announced Saturday. Schottenheimer, 49, will start his 25th season in the NFL in Dallas \u2014 his 14th as an OC. He has been working as a consultant for the Cowboys this past season. He replaces fired offensive coordinator Kellen Moore and head coach Mike McCarthy will handle the play-calling duties. \u201cI am thrilled and thankful for this exciting opportunity and embrace the high standards and expectations that come with this role and the Dallas Cowboys organization,\u201d Schottenheimer said in a statement. \u201cHaving long-standing, great respect and appreciation for Mike McCarthy as a person, a leader and a head coach makes this a very rewarding and compelling moment for me. The ability to win with great teammates that share the same goals, and alignment with how to reach them, makes this special for me and I am very grateful for it.\u201d His OC career started with the Jets from 2006 to 2011, helping the team to a 52-45 record. He developed under head coaches Eric Mangini and Rex Ryan, and worked with quarterbacks Chad Pennington, Brett Favre, Mark Sanchez, and Kellen Clemens. Schottenheimer made three playoff runs with the Jets in six years, including the 2009 and 2010 AFC Championship games. Former Dolphins head coach Tony Sparano replaced Schottenheimer in 2011 after the Jets finished with an 8-8 record and suffered poor season performance from Sanchez. Following the Jets, he ran the Rams\u2019 offense from 2012-14 in St. Louis before moving to Georgia as an offensive coordinator in 2015. After a year, Schottenheimer presumed the role of the Colts quarterback coach in 2016 and 2017, and later joined the Seahawks in 2018 for three years as offensive coordinator. Schottenheimer spent 2021 as the Jaguars\u2019 passing game coordinator under Urban Meyer. Advertisement The Cowboys will need Schottenheimer\u2019s expertise after falling flat in the playoffs to the San Francisco 49ers in the divisional round. McCarthy spent six seasons working for Schottenheimer father, Marty, with the Chiefs for six seasons beginning in 1993. \u201cI am very happy to have Brian take on this key role with our team,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cHe has been an important part of our staff already and has a great grasp of where we are and where we want to go.\u201d",

A FedEx aircraft had to abort a landing in heavy fog to avoid colliding with a Southwest Airlines passenger jet on the same runway. The crew operating FedEx's Boeing 767 had to execute a \"climb out\" in order to avoid landing on top of Southwest's Cancun-bound Boeing 737 at Austin Bergstrom International Airport shortly after 6 a.m. on Saturday. It's being investigated by both the Federal Aviation Administration, or FAA, and the National Transportation Safety Board. \"Shortly before the FedEx aircraft was due to land, the controller cleared Southwest Flight 708 to depart from the same runway,\" the FAA said, per Reuters . \"The pilot of the FedEx airplane discontinued the landing and initiated a climb out,\" it added.

Southwest's passenger jet departed safely and reached its final destination in Cancun, Mexico, per FlightRadar24 . In a statement posted on Twitter , the National Transportation Safety Board said it was \"investigating a surface event at Austin-Bergstrom International Airport Saturday, a possible runway incursion and overflight involving airplanes from Southwest Airlines and FedEx.\" In a statement to the Associated Press , the airport said it was \"aware of the Federal Aviation Administration's investigation into the discontinued landing of a flight.\" It continued: \"We will assist our FAA partners and their investigation as necessary.\" Southwest Airlines, FedEx, and Austin-Bergstrom International Airport did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Insider. It comes shortly after a Delta Boeing 737 had to abort its takeoff after a American Airlines Boeing 77 passed in front of it on the runway at New York's JFK Airport. The FAA said it was investigating the incident, which involved took place on January 13. One passenger aboard the Delta aircaft told Insider the jet came to a very sudden halt two or three seconds after it began accelerating down the runway to take off, thrusting passengers forward in their seats. \"There were vocal reactions, a few screams when the plane first started slowing, then total silence. I felt a surge of adrenaline knowing this was not normal, and not knowing what to expect,\" he said.",

    "content": "Fed Chair Jerome Powell mentioned disinflation 15 times in a Q&A with reporters this week. The Fed raised interest rates by 25 basis points Wednesday, in its latest tightening move. Powell's nod to slowing price increases has added to market speculation that rates may start falling this year.

Jerome Powell has been eager to remind investors that the economy is still deep in the throes of a battle with high prices and a potential slowdown. But the chair of the Federal Reserve may have been trying to get a different point across when he took to a Q&A with reporters Wednesday after raising interest rates by 25 basis points. Powell said it was \"gratifying to see the disinflationary process now getting under way,\" one of his 15 mentions of the term, while simultaneously warning investors this process still had a way to go before rate cuts could be considered. For investors who have been upbeat since the turn of the year as inflation continues to fall, it stoked optimism that borrowing costs could begin to come down ahead of schedule this year. What did Powell say? \"It is gratifying to see the disinflationary process now getting underway, and we continue to get strong labor market data,\" Powell said in his speech Wednesday. \"It's the early stages of disinflation and it's most welcome to be able to say that, that we are now in disinflation,\" he said later in his Q&A, cautioning it may take time to fully filter through to the economy. With his repeated mentions of disinflation, Powell was keen to reinforce the idea that price pressures are abating, despite his reminders that it was at an early stage and a \"couple of more rate hikes\" remained likely. Powell's consistent references to slowing price increases, alongside the idea that financial conditions had tightened - implying the rate hikes were working - caught investors' attention, adding fuel to a rally that has been in place for over a month. What is disinflation? Disinflation means slower price increases, and it's happening now in the US. The annual rate of consumer-price inflation fell to 6.5% in December, the lowest in more than a year, from a 40-year high of 9.1% in mid-2022. Core inflation, a gauge that strips out the more volatile energy and food components and is seen as a better indicator of sticky price pressures, has also subsided on a monthly basis. Supply-chain disruptions, felt around the world since the lifting of COVID-19 restrictions, are beginning to ease, while the more recent reopening of the Chinese economy has helped ease cost-side pressures, according to Powell. \"You see inflation now coming down because supply chains have been fixed, demand is shifting back to services, and shortages have been abated,\" he outlined. The pace at which price pressures abate would be a key factor in the Fed's rate decisions from here, following the staggering 450-basis-point increase in benchmark rates since last March. If inflation keeps falling toward the central bank's 2% target, policymakers will run out of reasons to keep rates elevated. Disnflation has helped lift investor sentiment even with a widely anticipated recession, fueling an almost 9% rally in US stocks since the start of the year. What does it mean for investors? While markets had already priced a smaller rate increase at the most recent central bank meeting, Powell's messaging still helped stocks gain on the day. Investors appear to be playing a game of chicken with the Fed over the likelihood that it follows through on its plan to cap rates at around 5.1%, which would require two more 25-basis-point increases, or whether borrowing costs have peaked. Powell was caught in a bind between trying to remind markets of his intent not to cut rates this year while not forcing a selloff with overly hawkish rhetoric. According to EY Parthenon's chief economist Greg Daco, the outcome was one that skewed slightly too dovish. It's possible that Powell will sound a more hawkish tone in the coming weeks to offset any of Wednesday's optimism, according to Daco. \"This loosening of financial conditions is undoubtedly not what the Fed was aiming for, and we expect a cacophony of Fed speeches in the coming weeks will aim to reorient the message,\" Daco said in his analysis. \"In other words, the infernal tango will continue as the Fed and markets try to find synchronized rhythms once again.\" For its part, EY Parthenon said that a couple of interest-rate cuts remained a \"distinct possibility\" for 2023.",

A wealthy British family is to publicly apologize to people in Grenada, an island in the Caribbean, where their ancestors had owned more than 1.000 slaves in the 19th century. The Trevelyan family owned six sugar plantations in Grenada. They plan to pay reparations to the descendants of slaves. The family met virtually in late January and agreed to write a letter of apology to the people of Grenada, the Guardian reports. Laura Trevelyan, currently a BBC correspondent in New York, visited Grenada in 2022 to explore her family's colonial past and detailed how she found \"instruments of control and torture.\" Trevelyan also explained that she visited a local school, where she asked who in the room was a descendant of slaves. \"Every hand shot up. Should my family pay reparations to the people of Grenada because we had owned slaves here? The answer was a resounding 'yes.'\" John Dower, a member of the Trevelyan family, has described the actions of his ancestors as \"crimes against humanity, and told The Guardian, \"We want to lead by example, in the hope that others will follow.\" According to The Guardian, a \u00a3100,000 fund ($120,545), donated by the BBC's Trevelyan, will be launched in Grenada on February 27 by her family members and Sir Hilary Beckles, chair of the Caricom Reparations Commission. \u2014John Dower (@JohnDower) February 4, 2023 Nicole Phillip-Dowe, the vice-chair of the Grenada National Reparations Commission, has celebrated the family's reckoning with their past. \"It's absolutely fascinating that I am seeing history being made. It takes a leap of faith for a family to say, 'my forefathers did something horribly wrong, and I think we should take some responsibility for it,\" said Phillip-Dowe, per The Guardian. British families who owned Caribbean plantations were paid substantial compensation by the British government when slavery was formally abolished in 1834. The Trevelyan family received \u00a326,898 at the time \u2014 the equivalent of nearly \u00a33m ($3.6 million), per The Guardian.",

Its rocket booster, Super Heavy, will return to land at Starbase or in the Gulf of Mexico, according to the filings, while Starship will land in the Pacific Ocean. SpaceX is yet to officially announce a date for its Starship launch and did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment. A test of a prototype for Super Heavy last July at the Boca Chica testing facility failed as flames burst from the engines on its test pad and an explosion sounded.

    "description": "Thirty-five new astronauts joined the corps in 1978, among them women and people of color who reshaped the agency forever, a new book shows.",
    "content": "A new book explores the astronaut class that permanently changed human spaceflight at NASA. \"The Thirty-Five New Guys,\" as the 1978 astronaut class called itself, brought unprecedented diversity to the previously all-white, all-male astronaut corps. That class included the first female astronauts, among them Sally Ride , who in 1983 became the first American woman in space. Also included were the first African-American astronauts, such as the first flyer of that group, Guion \"Guy\" Bluford , and Ellison Onizuka, who became the first Asian-American to reach space. \"It was a little bit like a mystery search. You have to find all these really cool pieces of information and put them together,\" author Meredith Bagby said of the five-year research process that resulted in the book \" The New Guys: The Historic Class of Astronauts That Broke Barriers and Changed the Face of Space Travel (opens in new tab) \", which will be published on Tuesday (Feb. 7) by William Morrow. Bagby's book shows that NASA undertook that diversity-boosting process only after facing immense pressure from Congress \u2014 and that the benefits to the astronaut corps were incalculable. \"The program was strengthened by hiring diverse people,\" Bagby said. \"Diversity actually brings greater success on missions, and greater success of the organization. Having people with different points of view come together and democratize information and treat each other equally actually turns out to be a really good thing for success.\" Related: Men, women and Mars: How gender diversity Is key for success on the Red Planet The New Guys: The Historic Class of Astronauts That Broke Barriers and Changed the Face of Space Travel (opens in new tab) (Meredith Bagby, Feb. 7, 2023) The 1978 NASA astronaut class included the first American women, the first African Americans, the first Asian-American, and the first LGBTQ+ individual. This behind-the-scenes look includes exclusive interviews with the astronauts and/or their family members. Numerous studies have pointed to the value of diversity, such as a 2019 analysis by McKinsey across dozens of countries. It found that companies that prioritized gender diversity in management were 25% more likely to have better-than-average profitability (opens in new tab) . The public sector also benefits: Today, NASA identifies diversity (opens in new tab) as aligning with values of integrity, teamwork and excellence, which the agency deems \"central to mission success.\" But the conversation around diversity was different in the era of the 1978 astronaut class. Certainly, NASA had diversified somewhat from the late 1950s and early 1960s, when it sought experienced (white) male test pilots to join the astronaut corps. But the agency was also famous for rebuffing more than a dozen highly qualified female pilots from early space missions; those women were later known as the Mercury 13 , in a nod to the first set of NASA human spaceflights in the Mercury program . Many women in crucial ground roles were also put in the background, such as talented Black female mathematicians and engineers later known as \" Hidden Figures \" in tribute to their success in flying space missions safely. Related: 'Hidden Figure' Katherine Johnson tells her own story in young readers' book NASA hired male scientist-astronauts in 1965, although it didn't fly the first of them (Harrison Schmitt) until Apollo 17 , the final mission of the Apollo program, in 1972. Schmitt was a trained geologist but was only reassigned from the canceled Apollo 18 flight after the scientific community lobbied NASA for his inclusion. The astronaut recruitment for 1978 was the first in nearly a decade, in anticipation of frequent space shuttle missions. It came with celebrity flair, as Black \" Star Trek \" actress Nichelle Nichols (\"Uhura\" on The Original Series) stepped in to lead publicity for the campaign. The result was 35 new astronauts: six women (including Jewish-American Judith Resnik), three African-Americans and one Asian-American, Onizuka. Some \"New Guys\" met with tragedy, however, including Onizuka, Resnik and fellow class members Dick Scobee and Ronald McNair. The four flew on mission STS-51L, the last flight of Challenger with seven astronauts on board. All seven lost their lives when the shuttle broke apart shortly after liftoff on Jan. 28, 1986. NASA made numerous technical and operational redesigns before resuming shuttle program launches in 1988. That crew's legacy is remembered warmly in the book, which features exclusive interviews with family members and friends to recreate the astronauts' experiences and feelings while at NASA. The book also shows the 1978 class in general as a turning point in NASA history, when the agency began to expand its astronaut corps to more types of people. Some diversity was unintentional; Ride's LGBTQ+ status was revealed only after her death in 2012, making her the first known in that community to ride to space as well. Related: This Pride, be inspired by Sally Ride's legacy The book includes a tapestry of reminiscences from the 35 \"New Guys.\" For example: Black astronaut Ron McNair grew up in the segregated south, only the third generation of his family to live free of slavery; the book recounts the literal railroad tracks separating white and Black communities in his hometown of Lake City, South Carolina. Anna Lee Tingle turned down a prestigious medical profession appointment even before she was called back for an astronaut interview, while Resnik snuck into Smithsonian Institution offices to ask advice of then National Air and Space Museum director Michael Collins , who flew on the historic Apollo 11 moon mission with Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin. Bagby found these accounts through talking with astronauts and their family members, reading diaries with family members' permission, and spending time with retired NASA personnel at places like Frenchies Italian Restaurant, a popular community hangout in Houston. (A big early help was George Abbey, the circumspect yet legendary director of flight crew selection during the era of \"The New Guys.\") \"It just takes time to get to really know the person ... what did they eat for breakfast? How did they feel in that moment?\" Bagby said. \"I felt very close to all the people I interviewed, and it was really just a wonderful process.\" Elizabeth Howell is the co-author of \" Why Am I Taller (opens in new tab) ?\" (ECW Press, 2022; with Canadian astronaut Dave Williams), a book about space medicine.

    "content": "The Chinese spy balloon is no more. An F-22 fighter jet destroyed the Chinese balloon on Saturday (Feb. 4) with a Sidewinder missile, taking it out with a single shot, U.S. military officials said. The uncrewed airship was over the Atlantic Ocean at the time, just off the coast of South Carolina. It was flying at an altitude of 60,000 feet to 65,000 feet (18,300 to 19,800 meters), while the F-22 was at about 58,000 feet (17,700 m), the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) wrote in an update on Saturday (opens in new tab) . For perspective: Commercial airliners fly at an average altitude of about 35,000 feet (10,700 m). Related: Chinese surveillance balloon in US airspace causes international stir Just shot at it! View from my house in Myrtle. pic.twitter.com/85EZ3EDbYq February 4, 2023 The U.S. military first detected the balloon on Jan. 28, when it entered national airspace near Alaska's Aleutian islands, the DOD update said. The airship cruised from Alaska into Canada, crossed back into the United States over Idaho, then continued moving southeast over the country's heartland. On Wednesday (Feb. 1), President Joe Biden ordered the military to take out the balloon as soon as this action could be taken safely, without putting anyone on the ground in danger, according to the DOD update. That opportunity came on Saturday, when the airship left terra firma behind over the Palmetto State. The remains of the airship fell about 6 miles (10 kilometers) off the South Carolina coast, into water about 47 feet (14 m) deep. The shallow water should allow recovery of at least some debris, analysis of which could reveal details of China's surveillance technology, military officials said. \"I would also note that while we took all necessary steps to protect against the PRC surveillance balloon's collection of sensitive information, the surveillance balloon's overflight of U.S. territory was of intelligence value to us,\" an unnamed senior defense official said in the DOD update. (PRC stands for \"People's Republic of China.\") \"I can't go into more detail, but we were able to study and scrutinize the balloon and its equipment [in flight], which has been valuable,\" the official added. \u2014 China sends new trio of mysterious spy satellites into orbit \u2014 Rocket Lab launches US spy satellite on mystery mission \u2014 Japanese rocket launches radar spy satellite Chinese officials have apologized for the incursion of the airship, which consisted of a solar-panel-equipped truss suspended beneath a big white balloon. They've also claimed that it was an innocuous weather-studying craft that strayed into U.S. airspace accidentally, at the mercy of the winds. But the unnamed DOD official isn't buying it. \"This was a PRC surveillance balloon,\" the official said. \"This surveillance balloon purposely traversed the United States and Canada, and we are confident it was seeking to monitor sensitive military sites.\" The official also said that Chinese balloons flew over parts of the continental U.S. at least three times during the administration of Biden's predecessor as president, Donald Trump.

    "content": "Raviv (previously known as Ricky) Ullman starred in \"Phil of the Future\" from 2004 to 2006. Since then he's acted in other series and films, but took some time to reflect on his Disney days. He said that even though he was having fun, he wishes he'd had more of a career strategy back then.

Raviv Ullman, known as Ricky Ullman at the time \"Phil of the Future\" aired, was the titular character on the Disney Channel show from 2004 to 2006. Since then, he's branched out from kids' television \u2014 joining a band with Zoe Kravitz at one point \u2014 and acting in a few films and notable TV series, like \"Criminal Minds: Suspect Behavior\" and \"Broad City.\" In an interview with E! News , Ullman discussed his time on the beloved Disney Channel show that became the \"centerpiece\" of his career. He said he felt he could have handled his success at the time differently: \"I was just a kid and enjoying what I was doing,\" but \"looking back now, I wish I'd been a little more strategic. I was 17. I don't think I knew how to be strategic or what that actually meant in terms of a career.\" He said Disney, at least back then, kept their stars' schedules packed: \"You shot your show during the week. But on the weekends, often you would shoot something like Circle of Stars, you'd go to an event at Disneyland, or you'd shoot a 'Disney Stars Are Just Like You' or a PSA about exercise,\" he said in April. Ullman also said he still keeps up with his co-stars from time to time, including Aly Michalka (known for the sister-band, Aly & AJ ), who played his best friend and love interest in the series. Even though Ullman spent time in the \"Disney Circle of Stars\" in the early 2000s, he said he was rarely star-struck. \"I knew Ashley [Tisdale] when I first moved to Los Angeles. I knew Dylan and Cole [Sprouse] before their show aired. Those were the people that we were hanging out with.\" The shift to being a Disney Channel star was a big one for Ullman, who'd been attending public school in Fairfield, Connecticut when he was first cast. \"All of a sudden, I was living in Los Angeles and going to work at 6 a.m. and doing schooling on set,\" but \"I loved being an actor, performing, working with a team of funny people to figure out how jokes work and how to make a good show.\" He went on to star in a few other projects for Disney, including \" Pixel Perfect \" and \" That's So Raven ,\" but seemingly disappeared from Disney very suddenly. Ullman said it wasn't an intentional decision \u2014 it just happened that way. \"I don't think I was looking at it like, 'now I am a Disney star and will do Disney movies forever,'\" but \"I never consciously was trying to break out.\" Fans remember that \"Phil of the Future\" had a short run, with only two seasons, and ended without resolving the romantic arc on the show. Ullman said he has no idea why it happened: \"Actors are rarely privy to network decisions, so I don't know why the final decision to end it was made,\" he said in a previous interview . Ultimately, Ullman said he'd be open to a reboot if the opportunity presented itself: \"I'll never say no. We had such a good time. I'm not going to be the one to turn that down, but I haven't heard any rumblings.\"",

While all eyes may currently be on Skinamarink as the microbudget horror film of the moment, with a box office approaching $2 million off a $15,000 budget, another movie is already breathing menacingly down its neck. Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey , the super-low-budget British slasher from director Rhys Frake-Waterfield that became a viral sensation last year for its childhood-bludgeoning premis e, released in theaters in Mexico on Jan. 26 and has so far amassed more than $950,000 in that one territory alone over two weekends. The film is due for release globally on Feb. 15, but its ongoing momentum \u2014 one that recently saw it come second on IMDb\u2019s list of the most anticipated films of 2023 \u2014 has already seen Fathom Events expand its U.S. launch from what would have been a one-day event to a full launch across some 1,500 sites over at least nine days. It\u2019s also due for theatrical releases in the U.K., Japan, Spain, Australia and New Zealand, as well as Southern and Central America. One of numerous films from prolific low-budget U.K. horror banner Jagged Edge Productions, Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey grabbed headlines in mid-2022 for a plot in which Winnie and his sidekick Piglet go on a cannibalistic rampage through Hundred Acre Wood having been left to fend for themselves by Christopher Robin. The subsequent noise \u2014 which hit the mainstream media \u2014 saw the planned digital release in late 2022 scrapped as bigger distributors came on board and a full theatrical rollout was planned. A sequel is already in development.",

    "content": "Rovio Entertainment, the Finnish-based video games company behind Angry Birds , has begun non-binding talks about a sale with Playtika, an Israeli group behind casino-style online games and shooting simulator 1V1.LOL . Playtika has offered \u20ac9.05 ($9.74) per share, or \u20ac683 million euros ($735 million), for Rovio in the latest consolidation move in the gaming business. The bid, when it was submitted on Jan. 19, corresponded to a premium of around 60 percent over Rovio\u2019s closing share price. Rovio shares have since jumped on news of the potential deal and stand at around \u20ac8.61 ($9.27). \u201cPursuant to its fiduciary duties, the board of Rovio continues to explore all strategic alternatives in order to reach the best possible outcome for Rovio and its shareholders,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cThere can be no assurance that the strategic review and the preliminary non-binding discussions will result in any cash or other tender offer or any other transaction, or the pricing of any such possible transaction. Rovio will release further information at an appropriate time.\u201d Playtika\u2019s move for Rovio follows similar consolidation moves across the gaming industry. Microsoft is in the process of buying Activision Blizzard, makers of Call of Duty and World of Warcraft , for $69 billion. Sony Interactive Entertainment last year acquired, for $3.6 billion, Halo creator Bungie Inc. Playtika itself is carrying out some international consolidation. The company last month unveiled it was laying off some 600 employees, 15 percent of its workforce, as it consolidates studios to focus on its \u201ccore products.\u201d The mobile game market, which shot up during the COVID pandemic, has been sharply down as of late. Estimates from gaming analytics firm NewZoo put global mobile gaming revenue in 2022 at $92.2 billion, more than 6 percent down from a year earlier. Rovio\u2019s signature game, Angry Birds , has been a huge international success, spawning a merchandising and media empire, including two Angry Birds films . But the company has struggled to diversify, despite acquisitions, such as Denmark\u2019s Darkfire Games in 2020 and the Turkish Ruby Games in 2021.",

    "content": "Linda Prine is a family physician and the co-founder of the Miscarriage and Abortion Hotline , which counsels women who want to use medication to self-manage their abortions. For women who need abortions in the states where the procedure is fully or partially banned, the medication, mifepristone and misoprostol, is often the best chance they have at receiving abortion care, particularly if they are unable to travel. In 2020, the last year for which full data is available, medication abortions accounted for more than half of all abortions in the United States. While the FDA recently authorized pharmacies to carry the pills, and patients to receive the medication by mail , online pharmacies in the US still won\u2019t sell or ship to states where self-managed abortion is illegal \u2014 meaning patients are often relying on overseas providers , which can take weeks. At the hotline, Prine and other volunteers talk women through the process of self-managing abortions, offer advice about a range of medical and privacy concerns, and help provide resources to women looking to order pills (the hotline does not provide the pills themselves). Prine and physicians like her are on the leading edge of the effort to ensure women retain their right to abortion care \u2014 an effort that will have important legal and political implications in the years to come . Vox spoke with Dr. Prine about how her work has changed since the fall of Roe v. Wade (the number of calls to the hotline, she says, have tripled since the Supreme Court\u2019s Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health decision last June), and what she thinks will be needed to protect their work providing telemedicine in states with restrictions in the weeks and months ahead. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. What made you decide to start the hotline? We actually started it during the Trump years, when we were just frustrated with all of the piling on of state restrictions, and little did we know how bad it would get. Initially there was only a group of 12 of us, and we staffed it for about 12 hours a day, and we each took a couple of shifts a month. That was plenty in the beginning. And then it got busier. Do you remember where you were when the Supreme Court decision came down overturning Roe ? I was actually in a car, traveling to go on vacation, and my phone just blew up. It was calls from the practice I was participating in, in New Mexico, because several of the clinics on the Texas side had given out our phone number as they were canceling people\u2019s appointments . I think I spoke to 60 people that day, just nonstop, trying to help them get care wherever we could. It was a really traumatic day for all those people. They were really calling us sobbing and freaked out and upset and incredulous. What has changed since the fall of Roe ? How has it changed your work? Well, the hotline is getting more calls, and the difference now is that many of our callers are later in their pregnancies, because they\u2019re getting their pills from overseas. They\u2019re ordering pills from online pharmacies, and they come sometimes with no directions. So they call us about that. But also, they\u2019re further along in pregnancy and they\u2019re calling us scared, because they\u2019ve passed a tiny but recognizable fetus, and they are freaked out and they weren\u2019t expecting that. And it\u2019s frankly traumatizing, what people are going through, because they haven\u2019t had any anticipatory guidance that this might be happening, and people who\u2019ve had an abortion before with pills didn\u2019t pass anything that they could see. The pills are approved by the FDA for up to 10 weeks and by the World Health Organization for up to 12 . Most of the time, though, they\u2019ve been used in our country under eight weeks; something like 75 percent to 80 percent of people using pills were using them under eight weeks pre- Dobbs . But now, they\u2019re using them whenever they can get them. And sometimes that is quite a bit later. Sometimes it\u2019s 14 weeks, 18 weeks . And so we get calls from people completely freaked out, crying, sobbing. I think for us, the trauma and the horror of the Dobbs decision is that people are having to go through something that they should not have to be experiencing. Do you feel like these delays are compounding trauma for people that they wouldn\u2019t otherwise have to go through, if they had access to the pills early on? Yeah, absolutely. People were not using the pills this late in pregnancy, pre- Dobbs . This is a huge shift. There\u2019s not research to support [that] yet. This is just what we\u2019re seeing on the ground. You mentioned that your staffing needs at the hotline are different now, post- Dobbs . We are up to 60 volunteers now. We went from 12 to 20 to 40. And then, yeah, with Dobbs we had to expand our hours and shorten the shifts. You just can\u2019t be on the phone for eight or 12 hours straight. So we do six-hour shifts now, and it\u2019s intense. You\u2019re getting text messages and phone calls at the same time and trying to talk to as many people as need you, and it\u2019s a little bit exhausting by the time the six hours is up. Are there other kinds of concerns that you\u2019re hearing from patients who are calling in? People are afraid to go to the emergency room if they think they need it, and most of the time they don\u2019t need it, so we talk them off that ledge and explain what they need to do to take care of themselves. But we also tell them, if they do decide to go, how to protect themselves in terms of how they explain what\u2019s been happening to them. In other words, they\u2019re having a miscarriage, they\u2019re not having an abortion, and that it\u2019s impossible for anyone in the emergency room to figure out that they used pills. There\u2019s no blood test for that. There\u2019s no exam to show that that\u2019s what happened. So letting them know how to preserve their privacy in the medical setting, when it\u2019s become a potentially dangerous place to go, has been really important. Now, it\u2019s not really true that any medical personnel has any duty to report a patient. In fact, they are not supposed to do that because it would be a HIPAA violation. And it\u2019s not illegal for people to be buying pills off the internet and using them. What\u2019s illegal, in most of these states that have passed laws, is for doctors to provide the pills. So the doctors, if they were providing the pills, would be the ones breaking the law, not the patients. But that doesn\u2019t mean that there\u2019s not an ambiance of fear out there. It hasn\u2019t been made clear to the general public, I don\u2019t think, that people using abortion pills are not breaking any laws. What are the other challenges patients are facing? The thing that\u2019s hitting us the hardest is the difficulty accessing care and then accessing the care late. And that\u2019s why so many of us have gotten involved in this movement to get shield laws passed in the blue states so that we can serve people with FDA-approved medications that we can mail quickly through the US Postal Service into those red states, so that people can get what they need in two to three days instead of over a matter of weeks. How do you think about your personal risk when doing this kind of work? Because it is not a zero risk for you as a provider. I live in New York City, so I feel very safe there. If it comes to passing the shield laws and we\u2019re mailing pills into the red states and some zealot from Texas or Louisiana or Alabama wants to try to arrest me, I feel confident that the law we\u2019ve passed in New York state, and the lawyers that have surrounded us with pro-bono offers, will take care of me. And really, the optics of arresting doctors for providing humanitarian care in these states that are restricting the care, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to win very many votes for the Republicans. So I\u2019m willing to be out there and let them see how that goes over. Other than the shield laws, are there things that state lawmakers and places that protect abortion rights could be doing to help make your work easier? Yeah, there\u2019s new legislation being proposed by Assemblywoman Amy Paulin in New York state that would allow standing orders to pharmacies for abortion pills . So that just as you can go into a pharmacy and get a vaccine without having a specific doctor order it for you, you could go into a pharmacy and get your abortion pills without having a specific doctor order it for you. That\u2019s brilliant. And if she needs a doctor to do the standing orders, sign me up. We\u2019re going to have to continue to get creative like this. And honestly, you don\u2019t need a doctor to get you abortion pills. You\u2019re swallowing them at home, no matter where you get them \u2026 It\u2019s really not rocket science. And people are totally competent to decide if that\u2019s what they need at that point in their life. So I\u2019m all in support of all of the initiatives that are making access to these pills easier. The safety and efficacy of these medicines is what people really need to understand, and especially the legislators, so that they can get more comfortable with easing up the access and making it possible for us to do telemedicine abortion across state lines, making it possible for people to pick them up in the pharmacy, and getting rid of the FDA regulations that make it hard to prescribe this medication. The other thing that we\u2019re seeing an increase in is people ordering the pills just in case. It\u2019s called advance provision. And those of us who work for Aid Access get a lot of requests for advance provisions \u2014 people aren\u2019t pregnant at all, but they want to have these pills in their medicine cabinet just in case. Especially if they live in the red states where it can take three or four weeks to get your pills, having them on hand is a really good idea. Is that something that you saw a lot of prior to this, people wanting the pills just in case? No. This has totally gone through the roof since the fall of Dobbs , especially in the first couple of weeks. People were overwhelmed with requests for advance provision. The bigger problems that I\u2019m hearing, from my OB-GYN colleagues in these red states, with normal maternity care, are terrible. I don\u2019t know what the solutions are for that other than to really have referendums in as many states as possible to make abortion legal. Would you feel comfortable telling us some of the things that you\u2019re hearing from your own colleagues about maternity care? I hear them trying to get their own patients to another state for care that they need, which is insane. If you have somebody who has a premature rupture of membranes with a pre-viable fetus, and they need to have that fetus removed for their own well-being and safety, and it\u2019s not ever going to be a living being \u2014 to not be able to do that procedure in your own state, but to have to transfer somebody who is at risk of hemorrhage, at risk of infection, is insane. It\u2019s an insane thing that\u2019s happening to health care. People are literally on Signal chats trying to find care for their patients. So, yeah, that\u2019s what I\u2019m hearing. That\u2019s the devastating news out of so many of these states. What else should we keep in mind? Now\u2019s the time to get proactive. That November election, the voters told us : We want access to abortion. So we need to get going and see how we can get people access. Enough of being afraid of our shadows, or that we\u2019re going to be criminalized for this, that, or the other thing. Let\u2019s get moving and see what we can do to make abortion available by every creative [method]: legislative, underground, crossing borders, whatever it takes. I think we\u2019ve won. The voters have told us they want abortion access, and the American people want it. So let\u2019s get that for them instead of worrying about our own criminalization.

The goal is to develop \u201cmuscle memory\u201d for settlements and handle large value payments in USDC on the Ethereum platform. The news was delivered by Cuy Sheffield, head of Visa\u2019s crypto division, at the recent StarkWare Sessions 2023 in Tel Aviv. According to Sheffield, global settlement with digital assets and fiat currencies is one of the key areas in which Visa invests. The payment giant is working to incorporate blockchain technology into its existing network to facilitate faster transactions. However, settlements currently still take place on the SWIFT system, which has limitations that prevent money from being moved as frequently as desired. To overcome these limitations, Visa has been testing the acceptance of settlement payments with stablecoins, such as USDC. Sheffield confirmed that the company sees huge potential in the blockchain and digital asset space and is looking to take advantage of its value on existing bank rails and rebuild it on top of blockchain rails using stablecoins. Former CEO Al Kelly has also shared the company\u2019s plans for central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and private stablecoins, stating that they \u201chave the potential to play a meaningful role in the payments space.\u201d Sheffield confirmed the company\u2019s positive outlook on blockchain technology and digital assets, noting that they are exploring ways to take the value that Visa provides on existing bank rails and rebuild it on top of blockchain rails using stablecoins. Sheffield said: Nevertheless, Visa\u2019s plans to allow for the conversion of digital assets to fiat currencies on its platform is a significant step forward in the company\u2019s efforts to build \u201cmuscle memory\u201d around settlements, particularly with regard to Ethereum and stablecoins. This move highlights the growing interest and adoption of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology in the traditional finance sector. Related Reading |",

Follow @ JamieCrawleyCD on Twitter Cryptocurrency exchange Binance has introduced a tool to help users calculate the tax obligations on their crypto transactions as governments increasingly look to ensure they don't miss out on revenue from the industry. The free tool can support reporting of up to 100,000 transactions and is available initially to users in Canada and France. The exchange has plans to extend it to other regions, it said in a blogpost Monday . Several countries have introduced firmer requirements around taxation of crypto assets in recent months. At the end of last year, Italy brought in a 26% tax on crypto trading gains in excess of 2,000 euros ($2,160). Meanwhile, India this month added teeth to its crypto tax rules, with a provision for jail time of up to 84 months introduced for non-compliance with reporting requirements. The aim of Binance Tax is to simplify the calculation of gains and losses throughout the year. For frequent traders, this could amount to thousands of transactions, meaning many hours of work to ensure correct calculation. Still, the product is in an early phase and does not support all types of transactions. Users will need to make adjustments. \"In one click, you can now import your Binance transactions into our calculator and obtain a simple yet comprehensive estimate of your tax obligations depending on your jurisdiction,\" Binance said on Monday .

    "content": "Sandali Handagama Sandali Handagama is a CoinDesk reporter with a focus on crypto regulation and policy. She does not own any crypto. Follow @ iamsandali on Twitter South Korea's Financial Services Commission (FSC) on Monday published guidelines on which blockchain-based iterations of traditional securities, known as security tokens, will qualify for regulation under the country's capital markets rules. The guidance comes ahead of highly anticipated regulations that will institutionalize security tokens . South Korea is working to regulate the crypto and blockchain sector comprehensively, with lawmakers of the country's National Assembly considering 17 separate crypto-related legislative frameworks . The discussions are aimed at creating the Digital Asset Basic Act (DABA), an all-encompassing legal framework for regulating Korea's dynamic crypto industry. Read more: South Korean Lawmakers Are Gearing Up to Regulate Crypto. What Could That Look Like? Security tokens refer to the digitalization of securities under the Capital Markets Act using distributed ledger technology, according to the guidance, and will apply only to digital assets that qualify. The guidance clarifies that stablecoins, which are crypto pegged to the value of other currencies such as the U.S. dollar and are used for payments or as a medium of exchange, will likely not fall under the definition of securities. Digital assets that have no issuer and do not have to \"fulfill the obligations commensurate with the investor's rights,\" will also likely fall outside of the scope of security tokens. \"On the other hand, digital assets corresponding to securities must be issued and distributed in compliance with all securities regulations under the Capital Markets Act,\" the FSC said. The planned rules are aimed at supporting innovation while ensuring consumer protection, according to the guidelines. \"During the first half of 2023, we will promote institutionalization by submitting amendments to the Electronic Securities Act and Capital Markets Act to the National Assembly,\" the FSC said.

It has a \u2018Favorite Artist\u2019 feature that allows users to basically follow their favorite artists to know when they have new releases or music. However, the feature seems disruptive for some users making it not so quick and definitely not easy. Apple Music, the popular music streaming platform, launched the \u2018New Music\u2019 feature in iOS in 2020. This feature alerts users to new albums, EPs, and videos from their favorite artists. However, the feature has not been working as expected for some users, as per reports ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 ). Alerts/notifications about new releases from favourited artists not working Source What\u2019s the point of adding artists to your favourites if it\u2019s not going to tell me when they release new music?? Source A number of reports have been shared on various platforms, including Reddit and Twitter, suggesting that Apple Music is not sending new release alerts or notifications for favorite artists. Some users were not able to receive notifications for new music releases from their favorite artists. This has caused frustration for some users, who are now turning to alternative platforms to track new music releases. One such platform is MusicHarbor, which helps users stay on top of new music releases, music videos, events, and news from their favorite artists and record labels. I use an app called Music Harbor for this Source One possible explanation for the issue with Apple Music\u2019s New Music feature is that many musicians are now releasing their music as saved albums on Apple Music. These albums don\u2019t have a fresh hit that Apple Music can identify. Only when the full album is made available or fresh music is released as a standalone album does the notification feature function. Apple is yet to acknowledge and provide a solution for this issue, but users can use platforms like MusicHarbor to stay on top of new music releases from their favorite artists. That being said, we hope Apple understands the plight of Apple Music users who are not getting alerts for new releases and helps them with a fix. Until then, watch this space and we will let you know about further developments, if any.

    "content": "GLENDALE, AZ \u2014 When most of the country is watching what will happen on the gridiron at State Farm Stadium on Sunday, law enforcement officials like Jose Muriente are watching in a different way. Muriente is with Air and Marine Operations (AMO) under U.S. Customs and Border Patrol. He and a pilot took an ABC15 crew for a flight in an H-125 A-Star over the stadium on Tuesday to show how a patrol would work. The choppers are just one of several aerial security vessels looking down over the big game come Sunday. If something warrants attention, the bird's eye view relays info down to the ground, much like when they work at the southern border. \"The tactics and techniques used for Super Bowl LVII are not different than what we do at the border however, the terrain at the border is austere and it's more dangerous than what we're doing here,\u201d said Muriente. With the ability of night vision, infrared and heat monitoring, the camera mounted on the front of the camera looks down to relay live pictures to a mobile command center. \u201cIf anything gets out of control, we're able to get our special response teams,\u201d he added. Over at Luke Air Force Base, officials stressed the No Drone Zone around the stadium. Starting Thursday at 6 a.m., the Federal Aviation Administration says that restriction expands to downtown Phoenix. \u201cIf a drone goes down the intake there, we no longer have an engine,\u201d said Major Robert Barlow, part of the massive Super Bowl security detail. On the day of the game, flight restrictions span two miles around the stadium. Then an hour before the game, FAA flight restrictions range from 30 miles around the area, up to 18 thousand feet. If someone breaches the secured airspace they could face criminal penalties or a $30,000 fine. \"We think drones in the area will be a serious determent to the safety of the stadium,\u201d said Daniel Mayo with the FBI Phoenix.",

    "content": "DALLAS \u2014 It\u2019s no secret that Ryan Hartman has had a tough go of it this season. A shoulder injury kept him off the ice for an extended period of time, then shortly after returning to the Minnesota Wild lineup, he was benched by coach Dean Evason for taking too many penalties. To make matters worse for Hartman, it seems like opposing teams score every time he\u2019s in the penalty box. It happened again in Monday\u2019s game against the Arizona Coyotes. Not even a minute after Hartman got called for tripping, Coyotes defenseman Jakob Chychrun found the back of the net. \u201cYeah,\u201d Hartman said before carefully choosing his words. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel great.\u201d As frustrating as this season has been, though, Hartman got a boost at Tuesday\u2019s practice when he was elevated to the top line to play between Kirill Kaprizov and Mats Zuccarello. He spent most of last season as the Wild\u2019s No. 1 center, and finished with a career-high 34 goals, which included 33 goals at even strength. ADVERTISEMENT \u201cHopefully we can try to rekindle some of that stuff,\u201d Hartman said. \u201cI plan on trying to keep it simple.\u201d That means shooting the puck when he has it on his stick, then going to the net and getting the heck out of the way when Kaprizov and Zuccarello are creating offense. \u201cJust try to give them space to do their thing,\u201d Hartman said. \u201cThey don\u2019t need me to help with that stuff.\u201d MORE MINNESOTA WILD COVERAGE: Pro Wild fall to Coyotes after sloppy game out of their bye week Simply put, the Wild can\u2019t afford to lose to a cellar dweller like the Coyotes February 06, 2023 10:47 PM \u00b7 By Dane Mizutani / St. Paul Pioneer Press Pro Wild embrace intimate atmosphere at Coyotes\u2019 temporary home, Mullett Arena The temporary home for the Arizona Coyotes has a capacity of 4,600 people February 06, 2023 02:59 PM \u00b7 By Dane Mizutani / St. Paul Pioneer Press Pro Wild return from bye week recharged, refreshed and, they hope, desperate After a week off, the Wild will play the Arizona Coyotes on Monday night at Mullett Arena in Tempe, Arizona.

Which players have stood out so far? As of Sunday afternoon, the Wild (27-17-4, 58 points) are just clear of the Colorado Avalanche for the final playoff spot in the Central Division.

January 28, 2023 06:27 PM \u00b7 By Dane Mizutani / St. Paul Pioneer Press Pro Wild show their bark, then their bite in overtime win over Flyers Matt Boldy scored a pair of goals, Marc-Andre Fleury chipped in with 28 saves, and Mats Zuccarello scored the game-winner in overtime January 26, 2023 10:04 PM \u00b7 By Dane Mizutani / St. Paul Pioneer Press Pro After stretch of bad penalties, Wild make Ryan Hartman a healthy scratch Evason: 'He\u2019s going to be accountable for his actions in the last game' January 26, 2023 03:48 PM \u00b7 By Dane Mizutani / St. Paul Pioneer Press Pro After rocky road trip, Minnesota Wild are suddenly out of the playoff picture Needless to say, it would behoove the Wild to bank a couple of wins so they don\u2019t have a sour taste in their mouth. January 25, 2023 08:36 PM \u00b7 By Dane Mizutani / St. Paul Pioneer Press This move has been a long time coming considering the Wild\u2019s struggles to score 5 on 5 as of late. They entered Tuesday\u2019s practice ranked No. 28 in the league this season with 85 goals at even strength. That\u2019s a shockingly low output considering the Wild finished ranked No. 3 in the league last season with 208 goals at even strength. \u201cObviously internally we\u2019ve talked about it,\u201d Evason said. \u201cWe need to score some goals.\u201d If practice was any indication, the lines for Wednesday\u2019s game against the Dallas Stars will feature Hartman centering Kaprizov and Zuccarello; Sam Steel centering Matt Boldy and Freddy Gaudreau; Joel Eriksson Ek centering Jordan Greenway and Marcus Foligno; and Connor Dewar centering Brandon Duhaime and Ryan Reaves. The shakeup was designed to reinvigorate the Wild in the immediate future. ADVERTISEMENT \u201cWe need to get a lot of people going, right?\u201d Evason said. \u201cWe need to get the team going as far as scoring goals.\u201d Hartman isn\u2019t taking this opportunity for granted. He started this season on the top line before being replaced by Steel for the past couple of months. Now that Hartman is back between Kaprizov and Zuccarello, he wants to be a spark plug. \u201cI think we are hard to play against and we defend really well,\u201d Hartman said. \u201cWe\u2019re just not scoring right now. We need to find that scoring touch again. That starts with shooting the puck and getting in front of the goalie\u2019s eyes.\u201d That said, Evason made it clear that it\u2019s on everyone to pick up the slack, not just the top line of Hartman, Kaprizov and Zuccarello. \u201cIt\u2019s not three guys that\u2019s going to get us out of not scoring,\u201d Evason said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be the entire group, and we\u2019re looking forward to seeing that start tomorrow.\u201d ADVERTISEMENT ______________________________________________________ This story was written by one of our partner news agencies.

    "content": "GILROY, Calif. (KGO) -- The fentanyl crisis continues to claim the lives of those who are using the dangerous drug, and leaders in the South Bay want to stop overdoses at the source after three men were found dead from suspected fentanyl use. On a small town road in unincorporated Gilroy on Monday, the deadly opioid crisis reared its head once again. Santa Clara County Sheriff's deputies found four men in their fifties unresponsive, likely from fentanyl use. RELATED: Are safe consumption sites part of the solution to SF's drug overdose crisis? \"They immediately applied life-saving measures and applied Narcan to every individual in that household,\" Santa Clara County Sheriff's Office PIO Sgt. Russell Davis said. \"Unfortunately, three of the victims inside the house were pronounced deceased at the scene. One male was revived with Narcan and was transported to a local hospital.\" Sergeant Russell Davis says fentanyl is the most dangerous drug in the country right now and stopping this crisis remains their top priority. Part of that effort comes in finding out how these men got the fentanyl in the first place. \"We sent detectives and crime scene investigators to the residence to conduct a full and thorough investigation,\" Sgt. Davis said. \"Based on the evidence that we retrieve, if we have enough information to link this back to a person responsible to this incident, there will be homicide charges that will be sent over to the district attorney's office.\" RELATED: Researchers are honing in on potential Fentanyl vaccine amid national opioid crisis We spoke with a group of friends at the home who said they were going to visit one of the victims in the hospital. They declined to speak on camera, but they told us the fentanyl crisis is truly getting out of hand. Santa Clara County leaders on the Fentanyl Working Group, like Santa Clara County Addiction Medicine and Family Medicine's Dr. Rachel Sussman, agrees, especially when it comes to youth drug use. \"The stakes of making a small mistake have never been higher,\" Dr. Sussman said. \"One of the crazy things of the fentanyl overdose crisis in youth is that it's happening in the face of decreasing drug use for youth.\" And yet, Dr. Sussman says they are dying from drugs more than ever before. Sussman says the Fentanyl Working Group has made strides in reactionary measures like having Narcan more readily available . But, she says the next step is preventing overdoses before they happen. \"I think we just need to not just work on the reactive piece, that means getting Narcan into people's hands, but really work on the preventive piece of reducing supply and demand and make sure that people have access to treatment if they developed an addiction,\" Sussman said.",

    "description": "More than 7,000 people have been reported killed and tens of thousands of others injured by the devastating earthquake that rocked Turkey and Syria on Monday. Here's what we know about the quake and why it was so deadly.",
    "content": "More than 7,000 people have been reported killed and tens of thousands of others injured by the devastating earthquake that rocked Turkey and Syria on Monday. Thousands of buildings collapsed in the two nations and aid agencies are warning of \"catastrophic\" repercussions in northwest Syria, where millions of vulnerable and displaced people were already relying on humanitarian support. Massive rescue efforts are underway with the global community offering assistance in search and recovery operations. Meanwhile agencies have warned that fatalities from the disaster could climb significantly higher. Here's what we know about the quake and why it was so deadly. One of the most powerful earthquakes to hit the region in a century rocked residents from their slumber in the early hours of Monday morning around 4 a.m. The quake struck 23 kilometers (14.2 miles) east of Nurdagi, in Turkey's Gaziantep province, at a depth of 24.1 kilometers (14.9 miles), the United States Geological Survey (USGS) said. A series of aftershocks reverberated through the region in the immediate hours after the initial incident. A magnitude 6.7 aftershock followed 11 minutes after the first quake hit, but the largest temblor, which measured 7.5 in magnitude, struck about nine hours later at 1:24 p.m., according to the USGS. Syria-Turkey earthquake death toll passes 7,200 as rescuers seek survivors That 7.5 magnitude aftershock, which struck around 95 kilometers (59 miles) north of the initial quake, is the strongest of more than 100 aftershocks that have been recorded so far. Rescuers are now racing against time and the elements to pull survivors out from under debris on both sides of the border. More than 5,700 buildings in Turkey have collapsed, according to the country's disaster agency. Monday's quake was also one of the strongest that Turkey has experienced in the last century -- a 7.8 magnitude quake hit the east of the country in 1939, which resulted in more than 30,000 deaths, according to the USGS. RELATED | Newborn, toddler pulled from Syrian earthquake rubble Earthquakes occur on every continent in the world -- from the highest peaks in the Himalayan Mountains to the lowest valleys, like the Dead Sea, to the bitterly cold regions of Antarctica. However, the distribution of these quakes is not random. The USGS describes an earthquake as \"the ground shaking caused by a sudden slip on a fault. Stresses in the earth's outer layer push the sides of the fault together. Stress builds up and the rocks slip suddenly, releasing energy in waves that travel through the earth's crust and cause the shaking that we feel during an earthquake.\" Earthquakes are measured using seismographs, which monitor the seismic waves that travel through the Earth after a quake. Many may recognize the term \"Richter Scale\" which scientists previously used for many years, but these days they generally follow the Modified Mercalli Intensity Scale (MMI), which is a more accurate measure of a quake's size, according to the USGS. The power of an earthquake is known as magnitude. The intensity of the shaking can vary depending on the local geography and topography, and depth of the quake. On the magnitude scale, each increase of one whole number translates to 32 times more energy. On this occasion, shaking from the 7.8 magnitude earthquake in southern Turkey could be felt as far as Israel and Lebanon, hundreds of kilometers away. Turkey is no stranger to strong earthquakes, as it is situated along tectonic plate boundaries. Seven quakes with magnitude 7.0 or greater have struck the country in the past 25 years -- but Monday's was one of the most powerful. It is also the strongest quake to hit anywhere in the world since an 8.1 magnitude quake struck a region near the South Sandwich Islands in the southern Atlantic Ocean in 2021, though the remote location of that incident resulted in little damage. Karl Lang, an assistant professor at Georgia Tech University's School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences, told CNN the area hit by the quake Monday is prone to seismic activity. \"It's a seismogenic area. It's a very large fault zone, but this is a larger earthquake than they've experienced any time in recent memory,\" Lang said. \"The magnitude of shaking that is felt on the surface is both a function of the amount of energy released, the size of the earthquake, but also how far that energy is released below the surface. So if it is very close to the surface, if it is a shallow earthquake, then it can be very dangerous.\" CNN's meteorologist and severe weather expert Chad Myers said, \"we always talk about the epicenter, but in this case we should talk about the epi-line.\" Two massive tectonic plates -- the Arabian and the Eurasian -- meet underneath Turkey's southeastern provinces. Along this fault line, \"about 100 miles from one side to the other, the earth slipped,\" Myers continued. Seismologists refer to this event as a \"strike slip\" -- \"where the plates are touching, and all of a sudden they slide sideways,\" Myers said. This is unlike the Ring of Fire, which runs along the west coast of the United States. In this zone, earthquakes and tsunamis are often caused by subduction -- where one plate slides below another. But in a \"strike slip,\" the plates move horizontally, rather than vertically. \"Why that matters is because the buildings don't want to go back and forth. And then the secondary waves begin to go back and forth as well,\" Myers added. Because of the nature of this seismic event, aftershocks could last \"for weeks and months,\" according to CNN meteorologist Karen Maginnis. In comparison with other large earthquakes around the world, the 2011 Japan quake and tsunami -- in which more than 22,000 people were killed or went missing -- registered a magnitude of 9.1. That incident left widespread destruction in its wake after walls of water engulfed entire towns, dragged houses onto highways and caused the country's worst nuclear disaster on record. A year before, in 2010, a magnitude 7.0 earthquake in Haiti is estimated to have killed between 220,000 to 300,000. A further 300,000 people were injured, and millions were displaced. In 2004, an earthquake with an estimated magnitude of 9.1 struck the coast of Sumatra, Indonesia, causing a tsunami that left 227,898 people dead or listed as missing and presumed dead. The strongest earthquake on record was a magnitude 9.5 in Chile in 1960, according to the USGS. A number of factors have contributed to making this earthquake so deadly. One of them is the time of day it occurred. With the quake hitting early in the morning, many people were in their beds when it happened, and are now trapped under the rubble of their homes. Additionally, with a cold and wet weather system moving through the region, poor conditions have made the rescue and recovery efforts on both sides of the border significantly more challenging. Temperatures are already bitterly low, but by Wednesday are expected to plummet several degrees below zero. An area of low pressure currently hangs over Turkey and Syria. As that moves off, this will bring \"significantly colder air\" down from central Turkey, according to CNN's senior meteorologist Britley Ritz. It is forecast to be -4 degrees Celsius (24.8 degrees Fahrenheit) in Gaziantep and -2 degrees in Aleppo on Wednesday morning. On Thursday, the forecast falls further to -6 degrees and -4 degrees respectively. The conditions have already made it challenging for aid teams to reach the affected area, Turkish Health Minister Fahrettin Koca said, adding that helicopters were unable to take off on Monday due to the poor weather. Despite the conditions, officials have asked residents to leave buildings for their own safety amid concerns of additional aftershocks. With so much damage in both countries, many are starting to ask questions about the role that local building infrastructure might have played in the tragedy. USGS structural engineer Kishor Jaiswal told CNN on Tuesday that Turkey has experienced significant earthquakes in the past, including a quake in 1999 which hit southwest Turkey and killed more than 14,000 people. Jaiswal said many parts of Turkey have been designated as very high seismic hazard zones and, as such, building regulations in the region mean construction projects should withstand these types of events and in most cases avoid catastrophic collapses -- if done properly. But not all buildings have been built according to the modern Turkish seismic standard, Jaiswal said. Deficiencies in the design and construction, especially in older buildings, mean that many buildings could not withstand the severity of the shocks. \"If you are not designing these structures for the seismic intensity that they may face in their design life, these structures may not perform well,\" said Jaiswal. Jaiswal also warned that many of the structures left standing could be \"weakened significantly because of those two strong earthquakes that we already witnessed. There is still a small chance of seeing an aftershock strong enough to bring those deteriorated structures down. So during this aftershock activity, people should take a lot of care in accessing those weakened structures for these rescue efforts.\" Hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees, already displaced by the civil war in their home country, are settled in the regions of Turkey that have been worst hit by Monday's earthquake. Turkey shelters more than 3.6 million Syrian refugees, according to data from Human Rights Watch. Many of these refugees are settled along the Turkish-Syrian border. The Hatay, Gaziantep and Sanliurfa provinces are each home to more than 300,000 Syrians, according to data from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Other neighboring provinces also shelter hundreds of thousands more refugees, who have fled their home country since the beginning of the Syrian conflict in 2011. In the wake of the disaster, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) said it was \"launching immediate cash assistance\" from its Disaster Response Emergency Fund to help relief efforts in both countries.

    "description": "Authorities feared the death toll would keep climbing as rescuers searched through tangles of metal and concrete for survivors in a region beset by Syria's 12-year civil war and a refugee crisis.",
    "content": "ADANA, Turkey -- Search teams and aid poured into Turkey and Syria on Tuesday as rescuers working in freezing temperatures and sometimes using their bare hands dug through the remains of buildings flattened by a powerful earthquake. The death toll soared above 7,200 and was still expected to rise. But with the damage spread over a wide area, the massive relief operation often struggled to reach devastated towns, and voices that had been crying out from the rubble fell silent. RELATED | Newborn, toddler pulled from Syrian earthquake rubble \"We could hear their voices, they were calling for help,\" said Ali Silo, whose two relatives could not be saved in the Turkish town of Nurdagi. In the end, it was left to Silo, a Syrian who arrived a decade ago, and other residents to recover the bodies and those of two other victims. Monday's magnitude 7.8 quake and a cascade of strong aftershocks cut a swath of destruction that stretched hundreds of kilometers (miles) across southeastern Turkey and neighboring Syria. The shaking toppled thousands of buildings and heaped more misery on a region wracked by Syria's 12-year civil war and refugee crisis. One temblor that followed the first registered at magnitude 7.5, powerful in its own right. Unstable piles of metal and concrete made the search efforts perilous, while freezing temperatures made them ever more urgent, as worries grew about how long trapped survivors could last in the cold. Snow swirled around rescuers in Turkey's Malatya province, according to footage circulated by the state-run Anadolu news agency. The scale of the suffering - and the accompanying rescue effort - were staggering. More than 8,000 people have been pulled from the debris in Turkey alone, and some 380,000 have taken refuge in government shelters or hotels, said Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay. They huddled in shopping malls, stadiums, mosques and community centers, while others spent the night outside in blankets gathering around fires. Many took to social media to plead for assistance for loved ones believed to be trapped under the rubble. Anadolu quoted Interior Ministry officials as saying all calls were being \"collected meticulously\" and the information relayed to search teams. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said 13 million of the country's 85 million people were affected, and he declared a state of emergency in 10 provinces. Turkey was already grappling with an economic downturn ahead of presidential and parliamentary elections in May. Adelheid Marschang, a senior emergencies officer with the World Health Organization, said up to 23 million people could be affected in the entire quake-hit area, calling it a \"crisis on top of multiple crises.\" Turkey is home to millions of refugees from the Syrian civil war. The affected area in Syria is divided between government-controlled territory and the country's last opposition-held enclave, where millions live in extreme poverty and rely on humanitarian aid to survive. Teams from nearly 30 countries around the world headed for Turkey or Syria. As promises of help flooded in, including a pledge of $100 million from the United Arab Emirates, Turkey sought to accelerate the effort by allowing only vehicles carrying aid to enter the worst-hit provinces of Kahramanmaras, Adiyaman and Hatay. The United Nations said it was \"exploring all avenues\" to get supplies to rebel-held northwestern Syria, and it released $25 million from its emergency fund to help kick-start the humanitarian response in Turkey and Syria. U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said the road leading to the Bab al-Hawa border crossing from Turkey to northern Syria was damaged, temporarily disrupting aid delivery to the rebel-held northwest. Bab al-Hawa is the only crossing through which U.N. aid is allowed into the area. Dujarric said the U.N. is preparing a convoy to cross the conflict lines within Syria. But that would likely require a new agreement with President Bashar Assad's government, which has laid siege to rebel-held areas throughout the civil war. Volunteer first responders known as the White Helmets have years of experience rescuing people from buildings destroyed by Syrian and Russian airstrikes in the rebel-held enclave, but they say the earthquake has overwhelmed their capabilities. Mounir al-Mostafa, the deputy head of the White Helmets, said they were able to respond efficiently to up to 30 locations at a time, but now face calls for help from more than 700. \"Teams are present in those locations, but the available machinery and equipment are not enough,\" he said, adding that the first 72 hours after the earthquake were crucial for any rescue effort. Nurgul Atay told The Associated Press she could hear her mother's voice beneath the rubble of a collapsed building in the Turkish city of Antakya, the capital of Hatay province. But efforts to get into the ruins had been futile without any heavy equipment to help. \"If only we could lift the concrete slab, we'd be able to reach her,\" she said. \"My mother is 70 years old, she won't be able to withstand this for long.\" But help did reach some. Several dramatic rescues were reported across the region as survivors, including small children, were pulled from the rubble more than 30 hours after the earthquake. Residents in a Syrian town discovered a crying infant whose mother apparently gave birth to her while buried in the rubble of a five-story apartment building, relatives and a doctor said. The newborn was found buried under the debris with her umbilical cord still connected to her mother, Afraa Abu Hadiya, who was found dead, they said. The baby was the only member of her family to survive from the building collapse in the small town of Jinderis, next to the Turkish border, Ramadan Sleiman, a relative, told The Associated Press. Turkey has large numbers of troops in the border region and has tasked the military with aiding in the rescue efforts, including setting up tents for the homeless and a field hospital in Hatay province. A navy ship docked on Tuesday at the province's port of Iskenderun, where a hospital collapsed, to transport survivors in need of medical care to a nearby city. A large fire at the port, caused by containers that toppled over during the earthquake, sent thick plumes of black smoke into the sky. The Defense Ministry said the blaze was extinguished with the help of military aircraft, but live footage broadcast by CNN Turk showed it was still burning. Turkey's emergency management agency said the total number of deaths in the country had passed 5,400, with over 31,000 people injured. The death toll in government-held areas of Syria climbed over 800, with some 1,400 injured, according to the Health Ministry. At least 1,000 people have died in the rebel-held northwest, according to the White Helmets, with more than 2,300 injured. The region sits on top of major fault lines and is frequently shaken by earthquakes. Some 18,000 were killed in similarly powerful earthquakes that hit northwest Turkey in 1999. ___ Alsayed reported from Azmarin, Syria, while Fraser reported from Ankara, Turkey.

    "content": "Summary: Attorneys from Russel Crumler and Christoper Farmer told a New York court on Tuesday that Three Arrows Capital (3AC) co-founder Kyle Davies and Su Zhu ignored the court subpoenas issued on January 5, per a report. The 3AC bosses were served on Twitter as court officials and law enforcement remain unsure of their whereabouts. Zhu disclosed to Bloomberg that the pair were en route to the United Arab Emirates while other reports claim that Davies fled to Indonesia to avoid U.S. extradition. Russel Crumler and Christoper Farmer represent the bankrupt crypto hedge fund following its collapse in 2022. These lawyers filed documents on Tuesday that said both Davies and Zhu have refused to cooperate with legal summons in line with their duties to 3AC. \u201cno compliance whatsoever\u201d, attorneys told the court while referring to the Davies and his co-founder Zhu. The filings added that both 3AC execs shunned legal proceedings while chasing other crypto business endeavors. All the while, Mr. Davies has continued to post on his Twitter account, openly ignoring the Court\u2019s directives and enjoying media attention while he continues to thwart efforts by the Foreign Representatives to gain access to documents and information. A leaked pitch deck that Davies and Zhu were working on raising seed funding for a new crypto venture \u2013 GTX. The crypto exchange would supposedly replace FTX and feature a $20 billion crypto claims market. GTX would, in theory, allow users to buy and sell claims from bankrupt crypto companies like BlockFi, FTX, and Mt. Gox to name a few. The GTX founding team also included CoinFLEX execs Mark Lamb and Sudgu Arumugam. Zhu confirmed that his team was \u201cjust busy building it\u201d, according to WuBlockchain.",

    "description": "Several metaverse-related tokens are flying high on Wednesday, with The Sanbox's SAND posting 24% gains over the day.",
    "content": "SAND, the native token of the metaverse gaming platform The Sandbox , is leading the crypto market after surging to a three-month high of $0.93 on Wednesday morning. Despite a slight drop to $0.90 by press time, SAND has still risen a whopping 25% over the past 24 hours, data from CoinGecko shows. The token was changing hands around $0.70 on Tuesday before the news broke that The Sandbox signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the Saudi Arabia Digital Government Authority (DGA). \u201cIt was a true honor to sign our MOU partnership ceremony between TheSandboxGame and the Saudi Arabia Digital Government Authority (DGA) during LEAP 2023 conference, and we look forward to exploring, advising, and supporting mutually each other in activations of the Metaverse,\u201d Sandbox co-founder and COO Sebastien Borget tweeted on Tuesday. It was a true honor to sign our MOU partnership ceremony between @TheSandboxGame and the Saudi Arabia Digital Government Authority (DGA) during #LEAP 2023 conference, and we look forward to exploring, advising and supporting mutually each other in activations of the Metaverse pic.twitter.com/mTBYqlwvUa \u2014 Sebastien \ud83c\udfde (@borgetsebastien) February 7, 2023 The Sandbox is a virtual gaming world where players can build, own, and monetize their gaming experiences. It originally used the Ethereum blockchain for both its native SAND tokens and non-fungible tokens ( NFTs ) before transitioning to Polygon in a move intended to enable faster and cheaper gas transactions. The exact details of the agreement between The Sandbox and the Saudi Arabian government remain scarce, however; and MOUs are not necessarily legally binding, rather signaling the two parties\u2019 intent for a broader agreement in the future. The Sandbox didn\u2019t immediately respond to Decrypt \u2019s request for comment. Metaverse tokens on the rise Elsewhere in the market, another metaverse-adjacent token, the Enjin Coin (ENJIN), hit a five-month high of $0.52 earlier on Wednesday. At the time of this writing, ENJIN is up 11.7% over the day, and as much as 85% over the month, trading hands at $0.51, per CoinGecko . ENJIN powers the eponymous online gaming platform, which enables players to own and trade their in-game items. The native token for Chiliz ( CHZ ) is also enjoying a hefty rally amid the sports-centric project's layer-1 blockchain launch. The token has more than 14% over the past 24 hours and trades at $0.17. ImmutableX ( IMX ), Flow ( FLOW ), Decentraland ( MANA ), and the token behind the play-to-earn crypto game Axie Infinity ( AXS ) are drafting on the sector's recent bullish activity, too.

    "description": "AI tokens are building momentum but nonetheless face challenges.",
    "content": "Interest in artificial intelligence (AI) has increased dramatically in recent years. AI is a breakthrough technology with the potential to fundamentally change countless industries, crypto among them. Enthusiasts view it as a key component of new financial and social ecosystems, including the project of decentralized finance (DeFi) . It\u2019s no surprise, then, that many new cryptocurrency projects are closely intertwined with aspects of AI. Below, we explore AI tokens in more depth and take a closer look at a few popular examples. Simply put, AI tokens are cryptocurrencies that utilize AI in some way to improve security, user experience, scalability, or a variety of other factors. In theory, AI can be trained to further automate and build trust or efficiency in many crypto systems. AI tokens can also be digital currencies designed to power AI-based apps or projects, including decentralized marketplaces or exchanges, image or text generation services, AI-based investment protocols, and more. The Advent of ChatGPT The crypto space\u2014and the worlds of business, education, and more\u2014have been buzzing about ChatGPT since its release in mid-2020 and particularly starting at the end of 2022 as it gained widespread popularity. ChatGPT is a chatbot developed by OpenAI, designed to generate human-like text and to perform a multitude of language tasks such as processing information, answering questions, and more. The potential for ChatGPT to further disrupt the crypto space is huge. For instance, Justin Sun, creator of the tron blockchain and token, has outlined a possible AI-based decentralized payment framework based on and supporting the chatbot. Perhaps more importantly, the sudden ubiquity of ChatGPT has sparked new interest among both crypto investors and those outside of the community in the possibilities of AI technology. Microsoft recently announced an investment of $10 billion in ChatGPT\u2019s developer, OpenAI, further boosting interest. Some crypto tokens experienced gains of 75% or more in late 2022 amid the rise of ChatGPT, and these gains have continued to accumulate for a select few AI tokens . As of early Feb. 2023, the total market value of all AI tokens was about $1.6 billion, small compared with the broader crypto space. But this is growing quickly, particularly as institutional investor cash continues to flow toward AI . Challenges and Benefits of AI tokens AI tokens are building momentum but nonetheless face challenges. These include the uncertain future of regulation surrounding the cryptocurrency market, competition from both AI projects and digital tokens, and a lack of public understanding about the details of many AI-based projects, which can be quite complex. As of Feb. 2023, the market value of all AI tokens was $1.6 billion or so. On the other hand, benefits of AI tokens include the built-in decentralization and security achieved by blockchain networks and limitless possibility for new applications and use cases. These are some of the AI tokens that have benefited alongside ChatGPT. AGIX AGIX is among the most popular AI tokens today. It is the token native to the SingularityNET decentralized platform. SingularityNET provides an open-source, decentralized blockchain market allowing users to buy and sell a wide variety of AI-related products and services. One of the key features of this platform is that it allows trades of models, data, and other tools used to improve AI through training. In this sense, SingularityNET is a platform both powered by and designed to benefit AI. FET FET is the medium of exchange for the Fetch.ai system. Fetch is a decentralized platform used to build intelligent, autonomous software and tools. It makes possible the launch of data analytics, decision-making, and prediction bots. NMR NMR is a token associated with the Numerai AI-based decentralized hedge fund. Numerai is a model for how artificial intelligence may be used to inform investment decisions. It utilizes a crowdsourced set of predictions from data scientists around the world as it considers possible investments. Contributors to those predictions are rewarded with NMR tokens for accurate forecasts. ALI ALI, standing for Artificial Liquid Intelligence, is a token used by the Alethea image generator. Alethea uses AI to create images based on input from users. It is known for CharacterGPT, an AI protocol that uses text descriptions to generate interactive AI-based characters. ALI tokens are used in the generation of character NFTs as well as for upgrades, incentives, and transactions. Hera Hera is a token tied to the pathfinder algorithm of the same name. Hera aids participants in the DeFi ecosystem to target the most efficient, profitable trading paths on decentralized exchanges. It utilizes machine learning algorithms which analyze prices, liquidity, trading volumes, and other data. Hera tokens allow users to participate in governance for the project and to share in protocol revenue. Cheat Sheet AI tokens are cryptocurrency tokens powered by\u2014or powering\u2014artificial intelligence projects, products, and services. AI tokens as a group received a sharp boost as ChatGPT gained popularity late in 2022, with select coins more than doubling in just a few weeks. As of Feb. 2023, the market value of all AI tokens was $1.6 billion or so. Some of the top AI tokens include FET, AGIX, and ALI. Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.

    "content": "Time hasn\u2019t healed the rift between Jill Zarin and Dorinda Medley from The Real Housewives of New York City . The RHONY stars returned for season 2 of The Real Housewives Ultimate Girls Trip and the reunion season fostered bad blood between the former friends . Medley shamed Zarin on RHUGT when Zarin asked if she could be part of Eva Marcille\u2019s radio broadcast . When Zarin became teary, Medley admonished her and called Zarin \u201cweak.\u201d They eventually tried to put the moment in the past, but clearly, it isn\u2019t. Medley and Zarin lashed out at one another as the season aired. Zarin said, months later she and Medley are still not in a good place. Zarin appeared on the Dear Reality, You\u2019re Effed podcast, and host Hannah Ferrier asked where she and Medley stood today. \u201cNot good,\u201d Zarin said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to say bad. I\u2019d like it to be better,\u201d Zarin said. \u201cI have no ill will towards her. In fact, I like her a lot. I mean, I knew Dorinda before she was on the show. We were friends. Not best friends, but we were friendly, that I would say we were friends. We definitely spent some time together. And, people change from things that\u2019s all I can really say. Some handle it a lot better than others.\u201d Medley, along with others pushed the narrative that Zarin was the \u201cthirstiest\u201d Housewife who was desperate to return to the show. \u201cSome people said it went to my head when I was on the show. I didn\u2019t think so, but you know what, that was me. I have to kind of see what other people thought. And I try to say OK, maybe you\u2019re right and I\u2019m wrong. Time has fixed that, I think. I really focus on myself,\u201d Zarin said. And \u201cI focus on my business. I focus on my family. The fame, not so much.\u201d With RHONY Legacy teased for months, Zarin seemed to be an easy pick for the series. But when asked about the show on the podcast, she said, \u201cI don\u2019t have much to say. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening with it. I really don\u2019t.\u201d Executive producer Andy Cohen tried to shut down rumors that RHONY Legacy was canceled. After a slew of rumors about contract conflicts and the series being dead, Cohen tweeted , \u201cDon\u2019t believe everything you read, #RHONYLegacy.\u201d Zarin also said that she isn\u2019t as thirsty to return to RHONY either. \u201c Under the right circumstances . It has to make sense for everybody,\u201d she said about doing RHONY Legacy . \u201cIt can\u2019t just make sense for them,\u201d she said referring to producers and the network. Plus, \u201cIt has to make sense for us too. It has to be a mutual thing. I\u2019m in a different point in my life now. I never thought I would go back. I\u2019ve moved on. It wasn\u2019t even something I thought about, asked for or anything. Would I like to be on TV again? For certain things. I loved filming Girls Trip. \u201d Despite Cohen\u2019s tweet, Bravo has not made any formal statements regarding RHONY Legacy or the future of the series.",

    "content": "The U.S. securities regulator will focus on cryptocurrencies and emerging technologies as one of its priorities this year, as it tries to keep up with the changing landscape of finance. In a statement , the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said it chose focus areas that it believes present potential risks to investors and the integrity of the American capital markets. The priorities are selected and published by the SEC\u2019s Division of Examinations, which conducts markets analysis to identify potential risks. \u201cIn a time of growing markets, evolving technologies, and new forms of risk, our Division of Examinations continues to protect investors,\u201d said SEC Chair Gary Gensler. \u201cIn executing against the 2023 priorities, the Division will help ensure compliance with the federal securities laws and rules.\u201d The Division plans to conduct examinations of broker-dealers and investment advisors who are using emerging financial technologies, including crypto. They will investigate whether these middlemen are meeting expected \u201cstandards of care\u201d to investors and whether they are routinely reviewing and updating risk management procedures. Richard R. Best, director of the Division of Examinations, said that the selected priorities reflect a \u201cchanging landscape,\u201d as well as the risks that follow those shifts. By keeping on top of the latest industry trends, he said, the SEC would be better able to identify potential perils for both investors and markets. Other areas to come under scrutiny this year include environmental, social, and governance (ESG) investing and the cybersecurity of securities professionals. SEC under pressure The SEC faced calls last month from Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren to do more to fight crypto fraud. While some would prefer the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to lead crypto regulation in the U.S., Warren said SEC rules represented the right approach for crypto. The regulator has already been stepping up its oversight of the sector, last year bringing a record number of crypto-related enforcement actions.

    "content": "Chart of the Day: Powerless in America \u2013 As Many Face Utility Cuts by Tom Williams February 8, 2023, 04:21 28 Views 5 Votes A new report compiled by the Center for Biological Diversity has revealed that the number of households having their electricity disconnected by power companies due to their inability to pay soared between 2021 and 2022. See below the executive summary of this report. Utilities cut off power to households more than 1.5 million times from January through October 2022 in the 30 states and Washington, D.C., where data was available. Extrapolating the rate of customers disconnected across all 50 states, we estimate 4.2 million household disconnections occurred across the country in the first 10 months of 2022. The shutoffs crisis is growing. We found a 29% increase in power disconnections and a 76% increase in gas disconnections in the first 10 months of 2022 compared to the same period in 2021, among power utilities and a subset of gas utilities providing data. A dozen companies perpetrated 86% of the shutoffs documented from 2020 through October 2022. Just 1% of their spending on dividends for shareholders could have prevented all their documented power shutoffs over that period. Those same companies spent $2.8 billion paying about 70 top executives in the three years beginning in 2019 \u2014 about $5.9 million per executive per year. By continuing to invest in fossil gas and infrastructure, ignoring price volatility, utilities are driving energy insecurity and shutoffs, particularly for households of color. Electricity prices are up about 12% since 2021, driven by the Russian war in Ukraine, utilities\u2019 reliance on fossil gas for power generation, and their ability to pass rising fuel costs directly on to customers. This economic precarity hit particularly hurts people of color; 1 in 3 families couldn\u2019t afford at least one energy bill last year. The scale of the shutoffs problem is masked by a widespread failure of transparency, with state regulators in nearly 40% of states failing to require any disclosures. Most notably, Florida stopped providing data in late 2021, leading to an apparent (but misleading) decrease in the number of shutoffs documented in 2022. Florida Power & Light imposed the most shutoffs \u2014 nearly 1 million \u2014 from 2020 through 2021. There are many steps federal and state lawmakers, and regulators can take to tackle the chronic disconnections problem. We provide the most comprehensive policy blueprint to date of what they can do \u2014 from banning utility shutoffs to transforming the unaccountable, dirty utility system. The harm is real and self-evident, as are the solutions. Leading the way among states who report such data is Illinois , whose main electricity providers shut down power for nearly 300,000 households between January and October 2022, a massive increase over the previous year. See below the top ten states that are experiencing these cut-offs. Seven utility parent companies in nine states and D.C. perpetrated nearly 70% of the shutoffs documented in 2022. They increased disconnections collectively by more than 22% over the same period in 2021: Exelon Corp. (31% increase), Southern Company (5% increase), DTE Energy (16% increase), Ameren Corp (10% increase), First Energy Corp. (20% increase), PPL Corp. (139% increase), and American Electric Power Co Inc (7% increase). See this in the table below. When utility bills go unpaid, it is because people are making difficult choices about where to put their limited money. The less income a family has, the higher the percentage that goes to fixed bills like energy, housing, and internet. As energy prices rise, energy bills consume an even greater share of families\u2019 earnings \u2013 known as the energy burden. As the world ramps up for a Ukrainian Armageddon, no doubt this will put even more pressure on energy prices, leading to higher consumer utility bills and ultimately forcing even more utility disconnections. After President Joe Biden gave us 40-year high inflation \u2013 many get ready to have the power cut. See more Chart of the Day posts.

    "description": "Rescuers desperately searching for survivors under rubble faced the grim dual challenges of winter conditions and hope fading as time passed.",
    "content": "Thinly-stretched rescue teams worked through the night into Wednesday, pulling more bodies from the rubble of thousands of buildings downed in Turkey and Syria by a catastrophic earthquake and aftershocks that killed almost 10,000, their grim task occasionally punctuated by the joy of finding someone still alive. Turkey's disaster management agency said the country's death toll had risen to 6,957 as more bodies were recovered. Officials in Syria said 1,267 lives had been lost and the White Helmets, a volunteer organization that operates in rebel-held parts of Syria, said 1,280 people had been killed there, for a total of 9,504. Tens of thousands more were injured, and many more were left homeless. Amid calls for the government to send more help to the disaster zone, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan was to travel to town of Pazarcik, the epicenter of the quake, and to the worst-hit province of Hatay on Wednesday. Turkey now has some 79,000 aid personnel in the quake zone, the Disaster Management Authority (AFAD) said, according to the Reuters news agency. But with the devastation so widespread, many are still waiting for help. A child looks on in the aftermath of a deadly earthquake in Kahramanmaras, Turkey, on Feb. 8, 2023. SUHAIB SALEM / REUTERS Nearly two days after the magnitude 7.8 quake struck southeastern Turkey and northern Syria, rescuers pulled a three-year-old boy, Arif Kaan, from beneath the rubble of a collapsed apartment building in Kahramanmaras, a city not far from the epicenter. With the boy's lower body trapped under slabs of concrete and twisted rebar, emergency crews lay a blanket over his torso to protect him from below-freezing temperatures as they carefully cut the debris away from him, mindful of the possibility of triggering another collapse. The boy's father, Ertugrul Kisi, who himself had been rescued earlier, sobbed as his son was pulled free and loaded into an ambulance. \"For now, the name of hope in Kahramanmaras is Arif Kaan,\" a Turkish television reporter proclaimed as the dramatic rescue was broadcast to the country. A few hours later, rescuers pulled 10-year-old Betul Edis from the rubble of her home in the city of Adiyaman. Amid applause from onlookers, her grandfather kissed her and spoke softly to her as she was loaded on an ambulance. The White Helmets tweeted video of another rescue: Once again, another miracle\u2026.. a child rescued after more than 40 hours of being trapped under the rubble of her house in the city of #Salqin in the countryside of #Idlib , #Syria yesterday, February 7. #SyriaEarthquake #earthquake pic.twitter.com/R7kRsNZFEG \u2014 The White Helmets (@SyriaCivilDef) February 8, 2023 But such stories were few and far between more than two days after Monday's pre-dawn earthquake, which hit a huge area and brought down thousands of buildings, with frigid temperatures and ongoing aftershocks complicating rescue efforts. Search teams from more than two dozen countries joined the Turkish emergency personnel, and aid pledges poured in. But with devastation spread multiple several cities and towns - some isolated by Syria's ongoing conflict - voices crying from within mounds of rubble fell silent, and despair grew from those still waiting for help. In Syria, the shaking toppled thousands of buildings and heaped more misery on a region wracked by the country's 12-year civil war and refugee crisis. On Monday afternoon in a northwestern Syrian town, residents found a crying newborn still connected by the umbilical cord to her deceased mother. The baby was the only member of her family to survive a building collapse in the small town of Jinderis, relatives told The Associated Press. Turkey is home to millions of refugees from the war. The affected area in Syria is divided between government-controlled territory and the country's last opposition-held enclave, where millions rely on humanitarian aid. Rescue workers carry Yigit Cakmak, 8-year-old survivor at the site of a collapsed building 52 hours after a 7.8 magnitude earthquake struck, on Feb. 8, 2023 in Hatay, Turkey. Getty Images As many as 23 million people could be affected in the quake-hit region, according to Adelheid Marschang, a senior emergencies officer with the World Health Organization, who called it a \"crisis on top of multiple crises.\" Many survivors in Turkey have had to sleep in cars, outside or in government shelters. \"We don't have a tent, we don't have a heating stove, we don't have anything. Our children are in bad shape. We are all getting wet under the rain and our kids are out in the cold,\" Aysan Kurt, 27, told the AP. \"We did not die from hunger or the earthquake, but we will die freezing from the cold.\" Erdogan said 13 million of the country's 85 million people were affected, and he declared a state of emergency in 10 provinces. More than 8,000 people have been pulled from the debris in Turkey, and some 380,000 have taken refuge in government shelters or hotels, authorities said. In Syria, aid efforts have been hampered by the ongoing war and the isolation of the rebel-held region along the border, which is surrounded by Russia-backed government forces. Syria itself is an international pariah under Western sanctions linked to the war. The United Nations said it was \"exploring all avenues\" to get supplies to the rebel-held northwest. The region sits on top of major fault lines and is frequently shaken by earthquakes. Some 18,000 were killed in similarly powerful earthquakes that hit northwest Turkey in 1999. -------------------- How you can help quake victims: Click here for details and links to several reputable aid agencies that are helping earthquake survivors in both Turkey and Syria.

Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin LUAR's Ana bag Mitch Zachary / LUAR EMCEE Studios is teaming up with buzzed about brands Dion Lee and LUAR for their New York Fashion Week Fall 2023 shows. The new creator-powered affiliate retail platform, is making its official debut over New York Fashion Week through runway partnerships with Dion Lee on February 10, the first day of the NYFW shows, and LUAR which closes the week on February 15. EMCEE is setting out to revolutionize the affiliate marketing space, promising to rewrite the rule book on traditional marketing practices for a more authentic, transparent and inclusive approach. Its social commerce model involves curated, conversion optimized showrooms for influencer creators with one simple, sharable url where followers can shop selected products. According to CEO John Aghayan, commission rates are also substantially higher than competitors. Aim is to foster relationships between brands and content creators by removing unnecessary steps from the typical affiliate user journey. With its proprietary technology, the platform combines original creator content with brand product details in a one-page shoppable hub, for a more seamless customer experience.

According to Aghayan, Dion Lee and LUAR have been selected for their shared vision in reinventing traditional concepts both in terms of aesthetic and core values. In Dion Lee\u2019s case, it was the Australian designer\u2019s overarching themes of renewal and transformation that proved attractive and where LUAR is concerned, it was the designer\u2019s goal to democratize access to fashion. \u201cPartnering with brands of Dion Lee and LUAR\u2019s magnitude is disruptive self-expression at its finest,\u201d says Aghayan. \u201cAt EMCEE \u2013 like these brands \u2013 we are at the forefront of innovation, so these partnerships truly are a symbolic way for us to kick off and wrap up EMCEE\u2019s first NYFW.\u201d Behind LUAR is Raul Lopaz, the Dominican-American creative from New York\u2019s Williamsburg, who co-founded cult favorite Hood By Air label with Shayne Oliver in 2005. He launched LUAR in 2017 and scooped Accessories Designer of the Year at the 2022 CFDA Awards. LUAR's Ana bag Mitch Zachary / LUAR His breakout style is the boxy Ana bag with its instantly recognizable looped handle and accessible Gen-Z friendly price tag that comes in just shy of $300. New York based Australian native Dion Lee launched his eponymous brand in 2008 and is known for his combination of fluid day to night silhouettes alongside the corset which has become his signature. The success of both Dion Lee and Raul Lopaz\u2019s LUAR owes much to celebrity traction on social media. Lee\u2019s fans include Hailey Bieber, Cara Delevingne, Megan Fox and Gigi Hadid who wore one of those signature corsets to celebrate her birthday last year \u2014 duly posted and shared via instagram. \u201cSocial media has allowed us to forge relationships with creatives across the globe and share our brand with the widest audience possible,\u201d says a representative from Dion Lee. \u201cIt\u2019s also been instrumental to the discovery and building of new relationships and the growth of our community in New York and abroad.\u201d As for LUAR\u2019s Ana, she has been spotted on the accounts of celebrities including Dua Lipa, Trove, Sivan, Julia Fox and many more. \u201cLUAR and EMCEE share foundational values of what it means to break down barriers and occupy spaces traditionally reserved for a select few. Our community's overwhelming support at our past shows has highlighted how limited fashion week can feel to our larger audience - we are hoping to change this,\u201d said LUAR Director of Business Development, Fidel Gomez Torres via email. \u201cFor our AW23 show, we are closing NYFW by extending it over three days of programming, with the goal of democratizing access to fashion week through a variety of initiatives and conversations, showcasing intersectionality between fashion, art, and commerce,\u201d he reavealed. \u201cGiven our shared values, it felt right to bring EMCEE into the mix as they understand and speak for the next generation of creatives and retailers.\u201d The NYFW partnerships see EMCEE curating front-row seats with top influencer creators dressed by Dion Lee and LUAR respectively as well as sponsoring an afterparty. Going forward, both Dion Lee and LUAR will continue their relationship with EMCEE over a period of 12 months, each offering three SKUs in custom colors exclusively for sale on the platform via EMCEE creator influencers.

    "description": "Edwards amassed 159 tackles in 2022 to lead the Eagles, which is quite an achievement, considering how ravenous his teammates are in pursuing the ball.",
    "content": "PHOENIX \u2014 If he knew the exact number he did not share that information. T.J. Edwards, how many tackles did you have this past season? \u201cIt was like 150, something like that,\u2019\u2019 Edwards said. Something like that. Edwards amassed 159 tackles in 2022 to lead the Eagles, which is quite an achievement, considering how ravenous his teammates are in pursuing the ball . \u201cI thought it was a decent amount,\u2019\u2019 Edwards told The Post, \u201cI just felt like I was doing my job, getting to the ball as fast as I could and making sure I made that right decision and making sure we\u2019re all in the right place. We kind of have a thing where we\u2019re all just checking a box of what we need to do on each play.\u2019\u2019 Edwards checks plenty of boxes for the Eagles, anchored in the middle of a dynamic defense as a fairly undynamic, workmanlike player. He does not often make the sacks or the jarring hits or the interceptions that lead to accolades and awards but his team would not be gearing up for Sunday\u2019s meeting with the Chiefs in Super Bowl LVII without his contributions \u2014 mainly his ability to determine where the ball is going and get there before help arrives. It will take a village for the Eagles to have any chance to contain tight end Travis Kelce, who had 110 receptions, 1,338 yards and 12 touchdowns during the regular season, and this will be one of Edwards\u2019 assignments. As one of the league\u2019s preeminent big-game performers, Kelce in 17 career postseason games \u2014 the equivalent of one full regular season \u2014 has been even better: 127 receptions for 1,467 yards and 15 touchdowns. The Eagles have a strong track record against tight ends. The most damage any tight end inflicted on them this past season came in Week 18, when Lawrence Cager of the Giants had eight catches for 69 yards. Edwards will be one of the Eagles defenders to try his luck with Kelce. \u201cI think he kind of catches people off guard trying to lull them to sleep at first and then he bursts out really fast,\u2019\u2019 Edwards said. \u201cHe\u2019s been a Pro Bowl tight end for a long time in this league and he looks as advertised on film. Really excited for the matchup, really excited to go against him. He\u2019s a special player, for sure.\u2019\u2019 Edwards was a four-year starter at Wisconsin but was not drafted, considered not quite fast enough or strong enough, not quite athletic enough. After one year making his mark on special teams with the Eagles, he earned a starting inside linebacker role in 2020 and has been there ever since. He started all 17 games in 2022, on the field for 94 percent of the snap on defense. His 99 solo tackles were tied for seventh in the league. \u201cI feel blessed to have the guys we have, the chemistry that we have is a big part of our success,\u2019\u2019 Edwards said. \u201cFor me, I just want to make sure we\u2019re all on the same page. I want to make sure I get to the ball on every play. You know someone\u2019s gonna make a big play, you just really don\u2019t know who.\u2019\u2019 It could be Edwards making the big play. If he does, it could be his final big play for the Eagles. Edwards is one of 20 impending free agents on a team that, win or lose in the Super Bowl, will look quite different in 2023. The Giants are a team desperate to upgrade at inside linebacker and they certainly are quite familiar with Edwards, who is one of the least-heralded players on the Eagles\u2019 roster. Given his status as a starter, Edwards was assigned his own table for the media sessions this past week. His area rarely was crowded and often, anyone seeking to speak with Edwards could saunter up and start up a private conversation. \u201cAll the attention, it really doesn\u2019t matter to me,\u2019\u2019 Edwards said. \u201cI just want to win the game and finish what we started.\u2019\u2019",

    "description": "The Liberty are taking the torch from the Nets' failed Big 3 and the neighboring Knicks.",
    "content": "The Liberty are taking the torch from the Nets\u2019 failed Big 3 and the neighboring Knicks. The Liberty signed Breanna Stewart and Courtney Vandersloot last week, finishing what was perhaps the most impressive free agency by a team in WNBA history, and the superstar duo was introduced Thursday morning in a celebratory press conference at Barclays Center. Liberty co-owner Clara Wu Tsai said they signed Stewart and Vandersloot for one reason: to bring New York a basketball championship. \u201cIt\u2019s truly a new era for the New York Liberty franchise. We set a goal to assemble the best team possible to contend for a championship,\u201d Tsai said before referencing the city\u2019s infamous title drought. \u201cNew York hasn\u2019t seen a basketball championship since 1973, and I think this team is ready to bring one home.\u201d The Liberty now boast one of the most talented rosters in the league, having five All-Stars in the starting lineup and a plethora of young talent , but the challenge now will be building chemistry. Stewart and Vandersloot insisted multiple times they didn\u2019t come to change the team\u2019s culture, but rather help build it with their own WNBA title-winning pedigrees. \"New York hasn't seen a basketball championship since 1973, and I think this team is ready to bring one home\" \u2013 New York Liberty owner Clara Wu Tsai pic.twitter.com/XcmWiVAhJ5 \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to come here and blow it up, we wanted to be additions,\u201d said Vandersloot, a 34-year-old point guard who owns the five best single-season assists averages in WNBA history. \u201cFrom day one, everybody is going to have to sacrifice, but it\u2019s all for the greater good. There may be a learning curve with each other, but we have the right pieces and goals, so we\u2019ll let the rest take care of itself.\u201d Part of the sacrifice for Stewart and Vandersloot is taking salary cuts to form this star-studded \u201csuper team\u201d within the confines of the league\u2019s salary cap. They\u2019re now positioned as the primary competition for the defending champion Las Vegas Aces, who added to their own \u201csuper team\u201d status this offseason by acquiring all-time great Candace Parker (though the Aces reportedly are under league investigation for circumventing the salary cap). Stewart and Vandersloot, who previously have played together in the Euroleague during the offseason, spoke about their plan to join forces in the WNBA and how this season seemed like the perfect time. \u201cWe both wanted to play together in the WNBA and go after a WNBA championship. \u2026 We\u2019re here for more than just the money,\u201d said Stewart, the 28-year-old forward who is a former MVP, two-time champion and arguably the best player in the world. \u201cI don\u2019t think last year I was ready to completely leave Seattle [and legendary teammate Sue Bird]. \u2026 Now, looking at New York, I also have the opportunity to play with one of the greatest to ever play. It\u2019s just about timing.\u201d Vandersloot said she was drawn during the free-agent recruitment process to the Liberty\u2019s plans and ambitions. \u201cThe vision right away was so clear. It was: \u2018This is what we see, this is what we\u2019re going to go do, we want to bring a championship, we want to bring the best players here, we\u2019re going to take care of you.\u2019 It was everything that we\u2019re looking for,\u201d Vandersloot said. \u201cI think we bought into how special it would be to bring a championship to New York.\u201d Dynasty in the making \ud83d\uddfd pic.twitter.com/MtvdOrCqNv One example that sold them, especially Stewart, was what they described as Liberty management\u2019s support for player health and wellness issues including getting the WNBA to approve the use of charter flights . \u201cWhen we talk about pushing the needle and raising the bar and elevating the WNBA, it\u2019s also about player health and wellness. When talking to Clara and Joe, they also feel the same way,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cIt\u2019s something that hopefully is not just a no, and can turn into a maybe, and then eventually turn into a yes in regards to charter flights.\u201d Liberty general manager Jonathan Kolb said he had the names of three players on a white board in his office this offseason: Stewart, Vandersloot and former MVP Jonquel Jones. He landed all three with Jones arriving in a trade last month . Showtime\ud83d\uddfd pic.twitter.com/2F8K24z4n2 \u201cWe were really tactical about getting who would fit,\u201d Kolb said. \u201cThis year is all about sacrifice, it looks great on paper but we have to let it play out.\u201d Of Stewart and Vandersloot, he added: \u201cThey\u2019re truly taking less to come here and win, and that\u2019s not an easy decision. And New York is not easy, and they have welcomed the challenge with open arms.\u201d Tsai said season ticket sales are up by over 50 percent, year over year, and the buzz is building in Brooklyn for what this new-look Liberty team can accomplish. \u201cEvery game is going to be a show,\u201d Tsai declared. \u201cAnd that is exactly what we need.\u201d",

    "description": "The international effort to provide food and shelter to victims of the earthquake that rocked Turkey and Syria intensified Thursday. Live updates. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0",
    "content": "The international effort to provide food and shelter to victims of the killer earthquake that rocked Turkey and Syria three days ago intensified Thursday as emergency personnel rushed tents and equipment into the battered region. The confirmed death toll reached nearly 21,000 Thursday, surpassing the total from Japan\u2019s Fukushima disaster in March 2011. That magnitude 9.0 earthquake triggered a tsunami, killing more than 18,400 people. In some locations where hope of finding survivors had vanished, crews began demolishing buildings. Vice President Fuat Oktay said rescue work was mostly complete in the cities of Diyarbakir, Adana and Osmaniye. The U.N. said its first cross-border aid convoy arrived in northwest Syria on Thursday. Six trucks of \u201cshelter items and non-food item kits, including blankets and hygiene kits,\u201d reached Bab al-Hawa, the only border crossing authorized by the U.N. Security Council for aid delivery. \u201cWe have a glimmer of hope that we can reach people,\u201d said Muhannad Hadi, the U.N.'s regional humanitarian coordinator for Syria. The International Blue Crescent Relief and Development Foundation said it was housing 9,000 survivors in in the Turkish city of Sanliurfa. And Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said his Foreign Ministry had cleared 5,709 international personnel to work alongside more than 20,000 Turkish recovery personnel in what he called \u201cthe disaster of the century.\u201d Turkish authorities said the death toll has risen to more than 17,600 in the country, with more than 70,000 injured. In Syria, including government-held and rebel-held areas, more than 3,300 have been reported dead and more than 5,000 injured. HOW TO HELP: How to donate to Turkey and Syria earthquake relief and recovery efforts DEATH TOLL RISES: Some areas will be 'uninhabitable for years' Developments: \u25baThe baby girl born under the rubble of a building in the Syrian town of Jenderis was named Aya, Arabic for \u201ca sign from God.\u201d Her great-uncle will take her in once she leaves the hospital. Her parents and siblings were killed in the earthquake. \u25baTurkey's Disaster and Emergency Management Authority said Thursday that 28,044 people have been evacuated from quake-hit regions \u2013 4,607 by road and railway, 23,437 by air. \u25baA 7-month-old baby was pulled out of a collapsed building in Turkey's Hatya province 66 hours after the quakes, the National Medical Rescue Team reported. \u25baErdogan said 92,738 family tents have been set up to shelter survivors, and 5,557 excavators, tractors and bulldozers were sent to the disaster area to aid the dig-out. PHOTOS FROM THE SCENE: Photos capture devastating aftermath of powerful 7.8 magnitude earthquake 'My brother is there': Rescuers make tough calls in last-ditch effort to find survivors Amid all the devastation and numerous buildings reduced to twisted metal and pieces of concrete, rescue crews have to prioritize where to focus their efforts, a practical decision with emotional ramifications. In the southern Turkey city of Adiyaman, Associated Press journalists saw a person pleading for rescuers to search through the rubble of a building where relatives were trapped. They declined, saying no one was alive there and they had to choose areas with possible survivors. A man who gave his name only as Ahmet told the news agency: \u201cHow can I go home and sleep? My brother is there. He may still be alive.\u201d There were occasional success stories, such as the 17-year-old girl who emerged alive in Adiyaman and the 20-year-old who was found in Kahramanmaras, prompting rescuers to shout, \u201cGod is great.\u201d But for many, the realization they may no longer see some loved ones alive had already hit. In Nurdagi, 67-year-old Mehmet Nasir Dusan had no hope of reuniting with five relatives buried under the debris of a nine-story building, but he was determined to find their remains. \u201cWe\u2019re not leaving this site until we can recover their bodies, even if it takes 10 days,\u201d he said. \u201cMy family is destroyed now.\u201d Slow recovery in Syria In Syria, local rescue crews said aid delays may have cost lives. The U.N. has drawn criticism for not taking exceptional measures to deliver aid in the warn-torn country. Karam Shaar, a nonresident scholar at the Middle East Institute, said the world organization should have broken protocol and used multiple crossing routes into Syria or provided airdrops. Lack of heavy machinery and other equipment often forced rescuers to clear rubble with their bare hands. Still, unimaginable rescues took place. \u201cAfter 50 hours of work, we pulled out a man and little girl alive,\u201d said Abada Zikri, a first responder with the White Helmets in Harem, a town of about 20,000 people in Syria\u2019s Idlib province. The White Helmets are a volunteer organization that lends aid in opposition-held parts of Syria. Sanitary conditions worsen amid slow recovery Resat Gozlu, a resident of Turkey's Adiyaman province, told the BBC that rescue teams did not arrive in her city until almost three days after Monday's quake. Gozlu, now living on the floor of a packed sports complex with his family, says many people are still trapped under the rubble. Others have died of hypothermia, he said. Local companies, aid organizations and civilians have helped by providing food and water, but other necessities such as toilets remain unavailable, he said. \"People are going in the street or abandoned buildings,\" he said. \u201cIf this continues, there could be serious health issues and illness.\" Sadness as bodies emerge from rubble In the Turkish city of Nurdagi, family members of people trapped inside a six-floor building that had collapsed watched as heavy machines ripped into the debris pile. Mehmet Yilmaz estimated that about 80 people were still beneath the rubble but that it was unlikely any would be recovered alive. \u201cThere\u2019s no hope,\u201d Yilmaz, who had six relatives, including a 3-month-old baby, trapped inside, told The Associated Press. \u201cWe can\u2019t give up our hope in God, but they entered the building with listening devices and dogs and there was nothing.\u201d Authorities called off search and rescue operations Thursday in the cities of Kilis and Sanliurfa, where destruction was not as severe as in other regions. WHY IS TURKEY A HOT SPOT FOR QUAKES? Deadly earthquakes have hit Turkey before: Why there? Could a similar quake strike the US? Turkey earthquakes horrific, but far from deadliest on record Several factors have combined to make the earthquakes and aftershocks in Turkey especially catastrophic. For one, they've impacted a stretch of about 300 miles where 13.5 million Turks live, along with an unknown number of Syrians. Shallow quakes like the ones that hit Monday tend to cause more damage, and the relative weakness of buildings in the region has also contributed to the death toll rising past 20,000. That still leaves this natural disaster far short of other earthquakes when it comes to loss of life. Estimates vary depending on the source, but according to britannica.com , the Great Tangshan Earthquake of 1976 in China killed 242,000 -- the government figure -- but may have claimed as many as 655,000 lives were lost. The website says at least 225,000 people in a dozen countries died in the 2004 earthquake that hit off the coast of the Indonesian island of Sumatra, triggering a massive tsunami. A 1970 earthquake off the coast of Peru killed about 70,000 people, mostly in massive landslides. Britannica says the 2010 Haiti earthquake might be the deadliest one on record with a government figure of more than 300,000, but other estimates were a lot lower. Regardless, the temblor left about 1.5 million people homeless. Turkish government fends off criticism Many of the tens of thousands who lost their homes have found shelter in tents, stadiums and other temporary accommodation. But despite the push to provide shelter from the winter weather, others have spent the nights outdoors. \u201cEspecially in this cold, it is not possible to live here,\u201d said Ahmet Tokgoz, who was left homeless in the Turkish city of Antakya. \u201cPeople are warming up around campfires, but campfires can only warm you up so much. \u2026 If people haven\u2019t died from being stuck under the rubble, they\u2019ll die from the cold.\u201d Turkish authorities rejected criticism that the government was not doing enough and said the scope of the disaster was beyond what any government could prepare for.

    "content": "Buzz around Bitcoin-based NFTs \u2014via the recently-launched Ordinals protocol\u2014keeps growing by the day, with record-setting mints on Thursday and high-value sales over the past day . And one established Ethereum NFT collection is reaping the benefits of going multi-chain, seeing its prices surge after revealing Bitcoin -based counterparts. OnChain Monkey , a collection of 10,000 Ethereum NFT profile pictures (PFPs) minted in 2021, used Ordinals to \u201cinscribe\u201d all of its existing artwork on Bitcoin over the past day. Now the NFT holders on Ethereum can also say that their respective collectibles live on Bitcoin, as well. Prices for the Ethereum NFTs have almost tripled since the announcement, with the floor price\u2014that is, the cheapest listed NFT on a marketplace\u2014for the project jumping from 0.79 ETH at the start of the day (per NFT Price Floor ) to a peak of 1.75 ETH before settling to about 1.5 ETH (nearly $2,500) as of this writing.

The analytics platform reports about $1.1 million in sales over the past day for a project with lifetime secondary sales totaling almost $39 million. Metagood, the startup behind OnChain Monkey, said it put all 10,000 NFTs onto Bitcoin via the Ordinals protocol using a single transaction , much as it did for the original Ethereum collection back in 2021. In a Twitter Spaces today, Metagood co-founder Danny Yang said that enabling trading was the next step for the team but suggested that other tooling needs to be created around Ordinals to facilitate that feature. He also noted that Metagood plans to build a bridge between Ethereum and Bitcoin to let NFT holders switch between the two versions. \u201cThey are the same on both chains,\u201d an OnChain Monkey Discord moderator wrote earlier today. \u201cBuy on ETH and you will have access to the BTC version when the tools catch up.\u201d Decrypt reached out to Metagood co-founder and COO Amanda Terry for comment and clarification on the Ordinals rollout but has yet to hear back. The project\u2019s Discord server is filling up with users who claim to have purchased one of the Ethereum NFTs following the Bitcoin announcement and are asking for details on how it will work. OnChain Monkey is part of Metagood\u2019s push to use Web3 initiatives to fund programs that benefit communities. These include efforts to fund coral restoration and provide aid to Ukraine amid the Russian invasion. Metagood, co-founded by venture capitalist Bill Tai alongside Terry and Yang, raised $5 million in December. Metagood and various collectors have taken to Twitter to proclaim that OnChain Monkey represents the first 10,000 NFT project to be minted on Ordinals\u2014a claim that the creators of Bitcoin Punks, a clone of popular Ethereum project CryptoPunks, have also made .

    "description": "Lido V2 could revolutionize way cryptocurrency staking is carried out",
    "content": "Contents Lido V2 Positive points for Lido Lido DAO is rapidly gaining recognition as one of the most promising platforms in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. Its popularity stems from its ability to enable investors to stake cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), Kusama (KSM) and Polygon (MATIC), without the need for minimum deposits or complicated infrastructure. In 2022, Lido stood out as a leader in ETH staking , thanks to its innovative approach to the challenge posed by the transition from proof of work (PoW) to proof of stake (PoS) consensus on the market's leading altcoin. Many cryptocurrency users face a significant barrier in staking ETH, as the required investment of 32 ETH is beyond reach for many. Lido provides an accessible solution that democratizes staking for everyone. The platform also incentivizes staking participation through daily rewards, maximizing the potential returns for stakers. Its token, LDO, is multichain, which allows for greater flexibility and increased access to different networks, such as lower fees and faster transactions. In addition, Lido's DAO plays a crucial role in the platform's governance, helping to build liquid staking solutions and fostering a community-driven approach to project development. The DAO empowers users to have a direct impact on the future of the platform and provides a mechanism for collective decision-making. This makes Lido's DAO a key factor in shaping the direction of the staking platform. window.coinzilla_display = window.coinzilla_display || []; var c_display_preferences = {}; c_display_preferences.zone = \"5335d7792eb489ae565\"; c_display_preferences.width = \"300\"; c_display_preferences.height = \"250\"; coinzilla_display.push(c_display_preferences); Ads window.coinzilla_display = window.coinzilla_display || []; var c_display_preferences = {}; c_display_preferences.zone = \"5335d7792eb489ae565\"; c_display_preferences.width = \"300\"; c_display_preferences.height = \"250\"; coinzilla_display.push(c_display_preferences); Ads Lido V2 The recently proposed update to the Lido protocol is being hailed as the most transformative change to the platform yet and represents a significant step toward greater decentralization. This has been a long-standing challenge for Lido, and the new proposal seeks to address it head-on. One of the key features of the update is the introduction of the staking router. With its new modular architecture, developers will be able to create gateways for new node operators, ranging from individual stakers to DAO clusters and Distributed Validator Technology (DVT), leading to a more diverse ecosystem of validators. The second major aspect of the update involves the upgrading of withdrawals. The new version of the Lido protocol on Ethereum will allow stETH holders to withdraw their funds at a 1:1 ratio, marking an important milestone in the Ethereum staking ecosystem by enabling truly open entry and exit. This change is expected to greatly enhance the usability of the platform and encourage greater adoption. Positive points for Lido The Ethereum network is poised to undergo a major transformation in March 2023 with the launch of the Shanghai hard fork. This event will enable network participants to withdraw their ETH, which has been locked up since the Beacon Chain. This development could provide a significant boost to Lido's position as a leading staking platform for ETH, as liquidity is expected to flow onto the cryptocurrency market. It is worth noting that Lido is also at the forefront of liquid staking on the smart contract platform. This innovative approach to staking allows participants to withdraw their assets at any time, without the restrictions that come with traditional staking, which requires assets to be locked up for extended periods. This advantage could help Lido differentiate itself from more centralized Ethereum staking options, such as cryptocurrency exchanges. However, maintaining this leadership position may not be straightforward for Lido, even with the recent improvements. With the advent of Shanghai, more staking platforms are likely to emerge, which could dilute Lido's market share. Nevertheless, this could be seen as a positive development for the Ethereum staking ecosystem, as it will lead to a more decentralized process.",

    "content": "How to feel more confident and comfortable in negotiating, a skill that everyone uses daily but which tends to be seen as a kind of dark art or is it down to science? Amid the backdrop of high-profile negotiations IE Twitter, let\u2019s look at ways many readers are negotiating on their own behalf right now \u2014 for more time, more funding, a better exit package, fewer investor protections \u2014 we talked with Taheripour earlier this week to ask where negotiations tend to falter and how to help them succeed. Excerpts from that chat follow edited for length and clarity. Neogiation iss something you learn, and I actually think most people are better negotiators than they think they are because we do it so much. It\u2019s only when we see negotiations through the lens of things that are really transactional and maybe conflict ridden that people put negotiations in a category of things people don\u2019t really enjoy or they\u2019re really afraid of or that are really uncomfortable, and they want to put it off. But any parent, anybody who\u2019s in a relationship, anybody who has employees, anybody who has a pet . . . is probably really good at negotiations. At the heart of all negotiations is human connection. That\u2019s where the magic happens. Most negotiations are not transactional. The best negotiations are either fostering relationships that we already have, or creating new ones. And once you look at it that way, then negotiations become a conversation. Some conversations are harder than others. But they shouldn\u2019t be if we open our minds to them with a sense of empathy and wanting to be creative and wanting to not focus on any one solution. It\u2019s building bridges. It\u2019s coming to an understanding. It\u2019s collaborative problem solving. It\u2019s decision-making. I always tell people that this is the last thing they should be afraid of. A lot of this goes back to negative self talk and self sabotage. You\u2019re not going to be an excellent negotiator just because you\u2019re smarter and have a higher IQ. Being an excellent negotiator really starts with you getting out of your own way. Great negotiators are great storytellers who can see themselves from a place of value and fearlessly self advocate. If you don\u2019t believe in yourself, if you don\u2019t fearlessly understand your own self value, then the goals that you set for yourself are diminished. They become safe. They may even become mediocre. And once your goals are watered down and safe, then what you ask for is going to be reflective of those goals, and you\u2019re not going to get enough. The minute you give up your power \u2013 you either back off in order to make the other [party] happy or to avoid conflict \u2013 then you can\u2019t stay in the conversation. You have to have the self-confidence that you two are part of this conversation and your space is as important as theirs. It doesn\u2019t mean those two things are mutually exclusive; it means that you seek solutions that are mutually inclusive. The way I teach is not at all prescriptive. I don\u2019t believe in always, and I don\u2019t believe in never. The older we get, our gut instinct becomes stronger and our intuition and emotional intelligence become stronger. We should be using these to navigate conversations, as opposed to trying to remember what a professor said in class. When you\u2019re boxed in like that, it creates a lot of anxiety, especially because no negotiation is the same, and the person sitting across from you, that audience, is always different. He\u2019s playing by completely different rules. Five or 10 years ago, this would probably be a nightmare for shareholders and companies because you want to hold on to what\u2019s happening until it\u2019s all done and then go public with it. But what\u2019s quite traditional is that he\u2019s controlling his own story and the messaging that comes out is his, no matter how confusing. If you think about it, he has been testing the water for far longer than the six months since he proposed buying Twitter. Every time he says anything about Tesla stock, prices change; people react immediately. So I think he saw the power that he had in literally changing markets [by using Twitter]. Truth be told, I was incredibly surprised when the deal fell apart \u2014 and there was the threat of litigation and things got messy and he tried to step away. I thought that for sure if the deal was to happen [after that], the stock price or deal valuation would be a lot lower at least. When [the deal was suddenly] back and it was not lower, I was baffled. What I can tell you is that I don\u2019t think Elon Musk does anything accidentally. I think that there was great intention. Twitter is this incredible platform for communication, and if you can control that one way or another, that\u2019s a lot of power. For a man who\u2019s sort of controlling transportation in some ways, [and] the future of outer space, I don\u2019t think that one day he woke up and said, \u2018Oh, maybe I should buy Twitter.\u2019 I think this has been on his mind for quite some time. And I think that he obviously sees its value, maybe in a way that none of us are even imagining.",

    "description": "This was the right move at the right cost and at the right time.",
    "content": "This was the right move at the right cost and at the right time. Now the Rangers have their legitimate first-line threat on right wing of the first line after Thursday\u2019s acquisition of Vladimir Tarasenko from the Blues in a five-asset deal in which third-pair lefty defenseman Niko Mikkola will also come to Broadway in exchange for the later of the Blueshirts\u2019 two 2023 first-rounders, Sammy Blais and Hartford defenseman Hunter Skinner. Now it is on head coach Gerard Gallant, who has driven his team to the seventh-best overall record in the NHL off an 18-4-3 surge that began just over two months ago despite constant instability, to establish a top-nine and allow it to gestate. Note to the coach: That means constructing a first line consisting of Tarasenko on the right, Mika Zibanejad in the middle and Artemi Panarin on the left and sticking with it. That also means inserting the left-hand-shooting Tarasenko onto the first power-play unit in place of Vincent Trocheck and reimagining the four-righty approach that has gone stale . Tarasenko is 31 and has a history as an elite goal-scorer who was a significant factor in the Blues\u2019 2019 Stanley Cup championship. He scored between 33 and 40 goals in all six seasons between 2014-15 and 2021-22 in which he played more than 24 games. Tarasenko is also a big-bodied winger who can protect the puck and get to the net. Yes, of course, it may take some time for him to mesh with Zibanejad and Panarin but that\u2019s the beauty of the timing of the deal. Three weeks ahead of the deadline, Drury bought that time for mutual acclimation. The Islanders and Lou Lamoriello jumped the deadline first by acquiring Bo Horvat. Now the Rangers and Tarasenko. Et tu, Devils GM Tom Fitzgerald, whose team suffered a massive blow with Thursday\u2019s announcement that the nonpareil Jack Hughes is \u201cweek-to-week\u201d with an upper-body issue? Tarasenko also has a history on and off the ice with his fellow countryman and friend, Panarin, who has been out of sorts for much of the season that has been his most ordinary since coming to Broadway four years ago. Tarasenko and Panarin were teammates on several Team Russias in international events, first in the 2011 World Juniors and last in the 2016 World Cup. They see the game the same way. Almost two years ago when Tarasenko asked out of St. Louis, he wanted to come to the Rangers. Panarin doesn\u2019t particularly love change. But that\u2019s been the hallmark of his season following sympatico centerman Ryan Strome\u2019s free-agent exit to Anaheim. No. 10 has played on 13 different line combinations \u2014 five centered by Zibanejad, five centered by Trocheck and three centered by Filip Chytil. This is not unique to Panarin, of course. But it seems to have taken a toll on him, the Russian Rockette having gone seven straight without a goal (and with one in the last dozen) entering Friday\u2019s Garden match against Seattle. Panarin\u2019s confidence seems down, witness his miss by a mile on a breakaway against Vancouver on Wednesday. The musical chairs portion of the season should now have come to an end. Gallant will have to decide whether it\u2019s Jimmy Vesey or Barclay Goodrow who drops out of the top-nine to join the fourth unit, but once that call is made, line combinations should become stable. The Kid Line \u2014 on for seven goals for and one against since reassembled five games ago \u2014 should be the no-doubt second unit, with Trocheck and either Vesey or Goodrow with Chris Kreider as the third line. It is time for some stability here. This is a pure rental deal with both Tarasenko and Mikkola \u2014 who will usurp Ben Harpur\u2019s spot across from Braden Schneider on the third tandem \u2014 pending unrestricted free agents. The first-rounder that went to St. Louis had been intended as deadline currency from the moment Drury acquired it in September from Dallas in the exchange for Nils Lundkvist. Blais and Hunter were easily expendable. The Blues\u2019 retention of 50 percent of Tarasenko\u2019s $7.5 million cap hit does provide some leeway for the club to bolster the fourth line and depth on defense before the March 3 deadline. According to CapFriendly, the Blueshirts will have $1,635,707 of AAV space at the deadline once Libor Hajek, placed on waivers, either clears and is assigned to the Wolf Pack or is claimed on Friday. Drury got a big fish without sacrificing, a) the better of the first-rounders; and, b) Brennan Othmann, Zac Jones, Matt Robertson, Vitali Kravtsov, Will Cuylle or Adam Sykora. They are all still in the pool of prospects. The Rangers are 29-14-8 without having actually hit their stride. They are a resourceful team that has been more than the sum of its parts.

    "description": "The Nets' surrender at the NBA trade deadline doesn\u2019t mean the Nets should be out of the business of superstar recruitment.",
    "content": "As the man running basketball operations in Brooklyn, Sean Marks made more hard pivots and broke more ankles on crossovers than Kyrie Irving ever could. So Kevin Durant finally did this week what he wanted to do over the summer. He told Marks that enough was enough. The second time around, Durant told the general manager that he is done with the Nets as surely as Tom Brady is done with football. \u201cFor good,\u201d in other words. Marks responded by sending Durant to Phoenix a few days after he sent Irving to Dallas, ending an era of big-name acquisition and small-game results in Hindenburg form. Starting in 2019, the Nets acquired Durant, Irving, James Harden and Ben Simmons. Today they have one playoff series victory and one catastrophe of a championship plan to show for it. But that doesn\u2019t mean the Nets should be out of the business of superstar recruitment. Owner Joe Tsai is reported to be worth more than $8 billion, and if he is serious about building a program with credible title aspirations, he\u2019ll throw big cash at Warriors general manager Bob Myers, who is scheduled to become a free agent at season\u2019s end. And Tsai needs to get word to Myers about his interest ASAP. That\u2019s the way the NBA works, the way it has always worked. Everybody tampers. Everybody whispers to invested third parties and dealmakers before contracts are officially expired. Everybody determined to hire the best available people, anyway. Myers has won four championships in the past eight seasons. He has done everything with Golden State that Marks said he would do with Brooklyn. If Warriors ownership is crazy enough to let Myers walk by not giving him the money and years he wants to stay, Tsai has to be right there with the best offer to hire him away. Let Myers try to build something special with all the draft picks the Nets acquired in recent days as they threw up their hands and surrendered. Kevin Durant is on the move. What\u2019s else happened at the NBA trade deadline? Follow our live tracker for news, rumors, analysis and more after a chaotic day. This isn\u2019t personal, just business. In fact, there is no second-guessing of Marks\u2019 choice to clear the cap space and close the deals on Durant and Irving in the summer of 2019. Even if they had some concerns about the point guard after he had walked out on LeBron James before walking out on the Celtics, the Nets had to take him as Durant\u2019s chosen sidekick. They had to do everything to land KD. Every organization would\u2019ve done the same thing. Every organization would\u2019ve waited a season for Durant\u2019s torn Achilles to heal, and then hoped he returned to the same level he reached while helping the Warriors win back-to-back titles. But Marks lost his way in the championship chase, giving too much personnel power to his franchise players. He replaced Kenny Atkinson with the ill-equipped Steve Nash, dealt away the future for James Harden and later dealt away the unhappy Harden to Philly for the perpetually unavailable Simmons. Swept by Boston in the first round, dismayed by all the Nets chaos as his former Golden State teammates were busy winning another ring, Durant eventually told Tsai that he wanted to be dealt if Marks and Nash weren\u2019t fired. \u201cI want to be in a place that\u2019s stable, and trying to build a championship culture, and I had some doubts about that,\u201d Durant said after he rescinded his trade demand. \u201cAnd I voiced them to Joe, and we moved forward from there.\u201d After sitting next to Nash in May and admitting that the Nets\u2019 culture \u201cisn\u2019t what it quite was\u201d and that they needed to get back to acquiring gritty, resilient and selfless players, Marks fired his coach seven games into the season. He replaced him with Jacque Vaughn, one of the few moves the GM actually got right. Irving and Durant just forced their way out regardless, leaving the past seven and a half months in Brooklyn looking like this: Kyrie opts in. KD opts out. KD opts in. Kyrie opts out. KD opts out. Unbelievable. Throw in the endless Irving controversies and absences, and it all summons another line from that May presser. \u201cAt the end of the day,\u201d Marks said, \u201cthe buck stops here.\u201d Yes it does. After seven years on the job, Marks hasn\u2019t earned another fresh start. He made one last mistake this week by betting on Durant staying, instead of dealing Irving to the Lakers and taking the two future first-rounders. Now Tsai has to take advantage of the fact that the salary cap doesn\u2019t apply to executives. The Athletic reported recently that some people around Bob Myers are predicting he will leave Golden State. Tsai needs to give him another reason to take on a new challenge. Myers hired Steve Kerr, not Steve Nash. He found Draymond Green in the second round. He signed Durant. He made moves for Andre Iguodala and Andrew Wiggins, and drafted Jordan Poole with the 28th pick. He built a genuine long-term partnership with Steph Curry, Klay Thompson and Green. Myers is a culture builder, not a culture talker. He\u2019s the next superstar the Nets should chase.",

    "description": "The firm says Rebecca Rettig left to take another job, not due to \u201cany dispute or disagreement.\u201d",
    "content": "A member of Silvergate\u2019s board of directors resigned Thursday, the crypto-friendly bank disclosed in a recent filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Rebecca Rettig, who initially joined Silvergate\u2019s board in March of last year, notified the company that she would be resigning yesterday. A graduate of Columbia Law School, she previously served as general counsel at Aave Companies, the group behind the decentralized finance (DeFi) platform Aave. Silvergate stated in the filing that Rettig has decided to leave the company because she \u201chas accepted an executive position at another company\u201d and will focus on her new commitments, adding it was \u201cnot the result of any dispute or disagreement.\u201d Rettig tweeted Thursday that she\u2019d be moving on to Polygon Labs to serve as the company\u2019s first chief policy officer. Silvergate nor Rettig responded immediately to Decrypt \u2019s request for comment. 1/ Some exciting \ud83d\udcf0 I\u2019ve joined Polygon Labs, the original dev of @0xPolygon , as its first Chief Policy Officer. I\u2019ll lead our \ud83c\udf0e efforts in crafting sound laws that will allow the web3 ecosystem to flourish. This presents a unique opportunity to move the industry forward\ud83d\udc9c \u2014 Rebecca Rettig (@RebeccaRettig1) February 9, 2023 \u201cI did some soul searching about the industry & how to build a future I believe in,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI kept coming back to the same idea: the most important thing right now is getting crypto policy right.\u201d Silvergate has recently come under scrutiny from the Department of Justice, which is looking into the La Jolla-based bank\u2019s handling of bank accounts tied to bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange FTX and Alameda Research\u2014the trading firm owned by the exchange\u2019s former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried. When Bankman-Fried\u2019s crypto empire crumbled and sparked an industry-wide bout of contagion last November, Silvergate\u2019s crypto-related deposits were rocked. The bank disclosed that it had seen its crypto deposits fall $8.1 billion in the last fiscal quarter of last year. At the same time, Silvergate said it drew a $4.3 billion loan from the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) to weather the torrent of withdrawals, in addition to selling roughly $5.2 billion in debt securities. U.S. lawmakers, including Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass) and John Kennedy (R-La), have criticized the bank for introducing \u201ccrypto market risk into the traditional banking system,\u201d pressing Silvergate CEO Alan Lane in a letter . \u201cCongress and the public need and deserve the information necessary to understand Silvergate\u2019s role in FTX\u2019s fraudulent collapse, particularly given the fact that Silvergate turned to the Federal Home Loan Bank as its lender of last resort in 2022,\u201d the officials wrote. The bank originally launched in 1988 but has become increasingly involved in the digital assets industry over time. In early 2022, it purchased assets from Meta related to its failed Diem stablecoin project for $200 million. Silvergate said during its most recent earnings conference that it took a $196 million impairment charge on the intellectual property and technology that it had acquired\u2014a 98% loss. Citing the current crypto environment, Lane said it would be difficult to bring its planned stablecoin to market \u201canytime soon.\u201d \u201cGiven the significant changes in the digital asset industry landscape, this charge reflects the Company\u2019s belief that the launch of a blockchain-based payment solution by Silvergate is no longer imminent,\u201d Silvergate stated. Silvergate\u2019s stock price toppled 9% Thursday before markets closed and fell 2% further to $15.44 per share in after-hours trading. The price represented a 93% decrease from its all-time high of $222.13, set in November of 2021. Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox. Your Email Get it! Copy link",

    "description": "Josh Sweat had an artery rupture while at home \u2014 and he knew something was not right.",
    "content": "PHOENIX \u2014 The Eagles called it a \u201clife-threatening situation\u201d when it happened, when The Eagle Who Cheated Death woke up light-headed and sweating early in the week before last year\u2019s playoff loss to Tom Brady and the Buccaneers . Josh Sweat had an artery rupture while at home \u2014 and he knew something was not right. \u201cI felt my abdomen heavy from all the blood spilling in there,\u201d Sweat said, \u201cbut I didn\u2019t know what was happening.\u201d After calling his parents and his agent, Sweat called an Eagles team doctor. \u201cHe asked me what was wrong,\u201d Sweat told The Post, \u201cand I said, \u2018I think I\u2019m dying.\u2019 \u201c \u201cHe thought I was joking. He said, \u2018But you got Tom Brady to get this weekend.\u2019 \u201d Instead, he got an Uber ride to the hospital for an emergency procedure . \u201cIt wasn\u2019t that scary to me because I called [the team doctor], I was like \u2018Just get me there, let me find out what\u2019s going on,\u2019 and then they let me know, but I was already in the hospital at that point when I found out how serious it was.\u201d His mother, Carlette, who would make the five-hour drive from Chesapeake, Va., remembers the call from her son. \u201cHe said he was light-headed and he had lost his vision for a few,\u201d Carlette told The Post. \u201cThe scary part was when they said how much blood he actually had in his stomach. They said if he had fallen asleep, he never woulda woke up again, and Josh loves to sleep.\u201d He was transported from the hospital to the Penn trauma center for an emergency procedure to have the artery cauterized. Sweat stayed overnight and Carlette saw him the next day. The Eagles medical staff wisely would not let him play against the Bucs, much to his chagrin. He was, however, cleared for the Pro Bowl. \u201cThey really didn\u2019t know what had happened, how it occurred and never did find out,\u201d Carlette said. This was not Sweat\u2019s first scary medical situation. Sweat had been carried off the field on a stretcher after attempting a tackle in Week 17 against the Saints, and thankfully it turned out to be a stinger, and nothing more. He came close to having his left leg amputated in high school in 2014 and waking up without a football dream. \u201cWe were blocking an extra point,\u201d Sweat recalled. \u201cI\u2019m the rusher \u2026 you\u2019re only supposed to have one rusher. But when the other side rushes, then you hit each other. He trips, falls into my leg, breaks it in half. \u2026 \u201d Breaks what? \u201cLike dislocates the leg, kinda at a 45, outward.\u201d 45-degree angle? \u201cPretty much, yeah.\u201d Sweat recalls the doctor at the hospital offering chilling words: \u201c\u2018We\u2019re gonna run the test to see if you damaged the artery, so you might have to lose it,\u2019 as he was already pumping the anesthesia in me,\u201d Sweat said, \u201cso by the time I coulda talked s \u2013t, I was already going to sleep.\u201d \u201cSo, I thought I was gonna wake up without the leg.\u201d Carlette: \u201cI don\u2019t know why they would tell a child that.\u201d It was a left knee dislocation. \u201cI had a good surgeon,\u201d Sweat said. \u201cRuss Warren from the Giants. I don\u2019t know how that happened, but I got hooked up somehow.\u201d Sweat would be a fourth-round draft pick in 2018 out of Florida State. A 6-foot-5, 265-pounder who likes studying Chandler Jones, Leonard Floyd and the Jaguars\u2019 Josh Allen, Sweat enjoyed a breakout 2022 season, totaling 11 sacks. \u201cEleven ain\u2019t enough,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m better than that. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m close to the ceiling right now.\u201d Carlette was flying in Friday to watch her 25-year-old son play in a Super Bowl. She remembers when he was an introverted boy who could build computers. Now he is friendly and laughs easily and envisions greatness. \u201cIt\u2019s a miracle just to see that the way he still carries himself, he\u2019s still happy, he still smiles, never complains about nothing that happens to him in his life, and just keep pushing,\u201d she said proudly. At Oscar F. Smith High School in Chesapeake, Va., Sweat was ESPN\u2019s No. 1 senior recruit. \u201cNow football has a different meaning to me, especially when I almost lost it all,\u201d Sweat said. \u201cI was a top recruit and all that, so I want to be back home where I was, one of the best guys at what I do. I got a shot to put myself back out there \u2019cause like I\u2019m very underrated, so this is a chance for me to go make it happen and help do something special.\u201d The Eagle Who Cheated Death will be charging after Patrick Mahomes and chasing that second Super Bowl championship for the Eagles, and his first ring.",

Kim \u2013 who lives in a $60 million mansion in Hidden Hills, California \u2013 said: \u201cWhen I designed the packaging for my SKKN BY KIM skincare line, I drew inspiration from concrete sculpture and varying shades of stone. \u201cI knew I wanted to complement my skincare collection with home accessories, designed to display my products and elevate the home with modern, minimalistic elegance. \u201cWhen designing this collection, I wanted to bring the monochromatic interior design elements from my home to others.\u201d Kim has also claimed that the \u201cminimalist design creates a sense of quiet and calm\u201d. \u201cI think having the concrete material and monochromatic design are important for my mental wellness. \u201cI find that there is so much chaos out in the world that when I come home, the minimalist design creates a sense of quiet and calm.\u201d Meanwhile, Kim recently claimed that her style \u201cresonates\u201d with the public. The reality star believes a lot of women are able to \u201cconnect\u201d with her sense of style because it feels \u201cattainable\u201d.

    "description": "This craft distillery is launching a new private cask ownership program.",
    "content": "When you think of Scotland, whisky is the first spirit that comes to mind\u2014and for good reason, given the stellar reputation of single malt scotch. But this craft distillery, located just outside of Edinburgh, is trying to convert scotch whisky drinkers to Scottish rum , and is now offering a private cask program to entice investors. Matugga Distillery was founded in 2018 by husband and wife team Jacine and Paul Rutasikwa. The distillery currently produces two labels\u2014Liv Rum and Matugga Rum. Liv has three expressions in its lineup\u2014white rum, navy strength and spiced rum. Matugga has a golden rum, spiced rum and Mavuno, a limited-edition single cask expression aged for three years. And now the distillery is opening up a private cask ownership program to the general public in the hopes that spirits aficionados and those interested in rum as a long-term investment will take notice. As we reported recently, rum has overtaken whisky sales in the UK, which is a huge development given the historical popularity of blended scotch there. Every year the rum industry would have us believe it is going to be the next big thing to compete with other brown spirits, and while that has not quite happened yet on a global level the category does continue to grow. Whisky expert Charles MacLean MBE agrees with this sentiment. \u201cFor many years now, drinks writers have been saying that \u2018rum will be the next malt,'\u201d he said in a press release. \u201cRecent statistics seem to support this. [Matugga] will certainly put Scottish rum on the map, and given the global prestige of scotch whisky, it will benefit from the connection.\u201d There are a limited number of casks available to invest in at the moment priced at \u00a33,300 per barrel (about $4,000). Each ex-bourbon barrel will yield about 350 bottles of rum after three years, every drop of which was distilled by head distiller and co-founder Paul Rutasikwa. His wife Jacine\u2019s family comes from Jamaica, which obviously has a long history in rum production. Paul, on the other hand, was born in Uganda, a country that grows sugarcane but is not really known for rum. He has plans to link production back to Africa, however, by opening a farm there to harvest sugarcane and turn it into molasses that will be sent back to Scotland to be distilled. According to Paul, the mild Scottish climate can be conducive to rum maturation as much as it is for whisky. \u201cMost rums are aged in tropical countries,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, we have proved right here in Scotland that rum also ages brilliantly in cooler climates. Although it takes a bit longer, the end result is as delicious, mature and rounded as anything from the tropics\u2026 Scotland has a little known and very deep rum heritage linked to the Age of Imperialism. Now, in 2023, we\u2019re part of Scotland\u2019s exciting new wave of rum distillers and there\u2019s a real opportunity for us to create history and take Scottish rum worldwide.\u201d If you\u2019re interested in investing in the Pamoja Rum Cask Offer program (\u201cpamoja\u201d means \u201ctogether\u201d in Swahili), check out the Matugga website for more details.",

    "description": "Home buyers are getting the Italian charm they're looking for half the price of homes in Milan.",
    "content": "With Brexit causing bankers to move out of London and into other European cities, the luxury real estate market in Milan has been booming. Yet, buyers looking for less expensive properties (and less competition) are starting to search in a different Italian metropolis. Rome is quickly emerging as a favorite of homeowners looking to score a deal in the wake of pandemic. The Eternal City has seen good recovery post-lockdowns, with prime residential sales volume increasing by 31.4 percent from 2020\u2014its highest level since 2007, according to Bloomberg . In comparison, Milan , while being Italy \u2019s fastest-growing financial hub, only experienced a 24.4 percent increase in volume in the same period. The capital can thank its appealing character and relatively low prices for swaying house hunters toward the city. In sought-after Roman neighborhoods such as Trastevere or Garbatella, for example, the average luxury home is priced at $6,500 (about \u20ac6,000) per almost 11 square feet (one square meter)\u2014half the cost of similar properties in Milan. And it looks like the aforementioned persuasive combination is getting results: One in three potential Italian high-end buyers searching for active listings online were looking for properties in Rome , according to a report from Immobiliare.it, a high-traffic property website in Italy, and LuxuryEstate.com. Rome is also undergoing a series of pivotal changes as it prepares for a flurry of activity, all of which will attract for visitors and buyers to the city. The Eternal City is playing host to the highly anticipated 2023 Ryder Cup (the first time the golf tournament has been held in Italy); planning to celebrate a Roman Catholic Jubilee in 2025, as well as 2,000th anniversary of the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ in 2033; and has thrown its hat in the ring as a candidate for the 2030 World Expo. All these events make the capital look rather attractive to investors, who are betting big with luxury hospitality brands such as the Four Seasons, and real estate firms, which are sweeping in on the city\u2019s large inventory of underdeveloped properties in well-located areas. Yet, acquiring property in Rome can have its fair share of red tape, thanks to the complex process of properly identifying the building and its history, which is required by law with a real estate purchase. That combined with the city\u2019s high amounts of traffic and a lack of public transport could be a deterrent to some buyers, though the national government is planning on improving rail ways, developing subway lines and focusing on urban renewal overall as part of its massive National Recovery and Resilience Plan. Even with these drawbacks, more wealthy Italian citizens are investing in larger homes in the aftermath of the pandemic. \u201cThe mood has changed, luxury hospitality is coming massively, there is a lot of liquidity available for prestige residencies and many opportunities to regenerate areas close to the center in order to host high-quality offices, student and senior housing,\u201d Domenico Bilotta, managing director of InvestiRE SGR, told Bloomberg . \u201cWhat has been missing so far compared to Milan\u2014and is still a deterrent for international funds\u2014is a long-term vision from the local administration on how to reshape some parts of the city, clear plans on how to make the most of existing buildings and urban spaces.\u201d",

About a month after Netflix canceled the comedy series starring Neil Patrick Harris, Showtime has revived the show with a second-season pickup. Uncoupled comes from MTV Entertainment Studios, which like Showtime is part of Paramount Global. The news also comes hours after another series \u2014 Ripley , based on Patricia Highsmith\u2019s Tom Ripley novels \u2014 went the other direction, moving from Showtime to Netflix . Created by Darren Star, who has an overall deal at Paramount Global, and Jeffrey Richman, Uncoupled stars Harris as a man who tries to rebuild his life after his long-time boyfriend (Tuc Watkins) moves out. Tisha Campbell, Brooks Ashmanskas, Emerson Brooks and Marcia Gay Harden also star. Uncoupled premiered in July 2022 on Netflix and received generally positive reviews; The Hollywood Reporter\u2019s Angie Han wrote that the show is \u201cblessed with enough wry humor and self-awareness to land just on the right side of likable.\u201d It was not a breakout hit, however, landing in the streamer\u2019s internal top 10 rankings just once. Showtime, meanwhile, is set to merge with Paramount+ and is shifting its programing focus. While franchising popular shows like Billions and Dexter is a key cog of the strategy, the premium outlet (or that portion of the future combined platform) will also look to offer what it deems \u201cculturally diverse\u201d programming, a la The Chi, The L Word: Generation Q and now Uncoupled .

    "content": "Gov. J.B. Pritzker on Friday signed into a law a measure that loosens restrictions for people with past felony convictions who want to legally change their names. The measure passed last month in the Illinois Senate after being approved with bipartisan support in the House in 2021. Advertisement While opponents have argued the measure would allow felons to escape scrutiny and potentially commit more crimes, supporters maintained the legislation would protect transgender individuals who face discrimination, as well as victims of human trafficking who face danger from their abusers. Under the new law, which takes effect Jan. 1, there is no longer a lifetime ban on name changes for people who have been convicted of identity theft, as well as for those on state registries for convictions on offenses that include murder, arson and various sex crimes. For all other felonies, the law lifts a 10-year waiting period from the completion of a sentence for people to change their names. Advertisement Judges will have the final word over approving name changes for people convicted of felonies that had been subject to the lifetime ban, and the measure would allow county prosecutors to object to those name-change petitions. In those cases, the petitioners would have to convince judges that they want to change their name because they\u2019re transgender, were victims of human trafficking, for religious reasons or because they got married. \u201cThe bill moves Illinois closer to a fair, modern system regarding the ability of transgender and gender expansive individuals, as well as survivors of human trafficking and domestic violence to change their names,\u201d Khadine Bennett, director of advocacy and intergovernmental affairs at the American Civil Liberties Union of Illinois, said in a statement Friday afternoon. \u201cSurvivors of human trafficking and transgender people too often are at risk simply because they do not have identity documents that align with their authentic selves,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cThis is corrected under the new law.\u201d jgorner@chicagotribune.com",

The famed, 50,000-acre Scottish estate just announced that it will be reopening for the first time since the monarch passed away, ahead of King Charles III\u2019s coronation on May 6, 2023. The British royal family \u2019s former holiday home has been welcoming the public to its grounds every spring and summer since 1931. And while the estate itself remains closed, visitors will be able to partake in guided excursions of the grounds, gardens and exhibitions starting on Saturday, April 1. This year, the castle revealed on social media that it will be hosting a special photographic exhibit dubbed \u201cMonarchs of Balmoral.\u201d Outside of the main gates will be a floral tribute to the late Queen, should you want to leave anything in her honor. Unlike other official royal residences which are owned by the Crown Estate, Balmoral Castle is one of two private properties that belonged to Queen Elizabeth II\u2014the second is Sandringham Estate in Norfolk. Balmoral was originally purchased by Prince Albert and Queen Victoria in 1852 and later passed down through the family. In a 2016 documentary entitled Our Queen at Ninety , Princess Eugenie had this to say about the country home: \u201cIt\u2019s the most beautiful place on earth. I think Granny is most happy there.

    "content": "The Global Disinformation Index (GDI), a foreign think tank headquartered in the United Kingdom, released an assessment of American online media designed to blacklist conservative media outlets and choke off their advertising revenue. The information is kept on what GDI calls its \u201cDynamic Exclusion List.\u201d Ad networks \u2014 including most prominently Xandr \u2014 which is owned by Microsoft \u2014 are now using this list to refuse to allow advertising on conservative media websites. Microsoft has yet to respond to a request for comment regarding Xandr\u2019s use of the Dynamic Exclusion List, which is censoring conservative outlets. GDI in December released its report that detailed the alleged \u201cdisinformation risk\u201d for the American online media market in partnership with the Global Disinformation Lab (GDIL), a think tank at the University of Texas at Austin that generates policy recommendations and solutions to combat disinformation. The GDI report on the American online media landscape reviewed 69 news outlets, and listed ten outlets it found are the most at risk of spreading disinformation, and ten outlets that are the least likely to spread disinformation. GDI rated conservative sites as having the highest risk for spreading disinformation and liberal websites as the most trusted. The report found many left-wing outlets that were the least risky, which include: HuffPost New York Times The Washington Post AP News NPR ProPublica BuzzFeed News USA Today Insider Wall Street Journal GDI labeled NPR, AP News, the New York Times , and ProPublica as the \u201cfour minimum-risk sites.\u201d A report from the Washington Examiner detailed that, citing a senior executive, Breitbart News is on the GDI\u2019s Dynamic Exclusion List. In contrast, the outlets at most risk of sharing disinformation were right-leaning, which include: New York Post RealClearPolitics Reason Magazine The Federalist The Daily Wire The Blaze One America News Network The American Conservative Newsmax The American Spectator GDI has not responded to several requests from Breitbart News for comment about the nature of its Dynamic Exclusion List and the organizations it partners with, as well as requests to connect with a spokesperson. GDI did not respond to comments requests on December 13, D ecember 27, January 5, and January 23. After these many press inquiries, GDI has refused to release its Dynamic Exclusion List despite assertions on its website that its work is guided by \u201cneutrality\u201d, \u201cindependence\u201d and \u201ctransparency.\u201d Breitbart is on the list \u2013 somewhere. But, again, GDI refuses to disclose the full List. GDI was founded by Clare Melford and Professor Daniel Rogers founded GDI. According to the World Economic Forum, Melford led the transition of the European Council of Foreign Relations to independent status from George Soros\u2019s Open Society Foundation. Before her time at GDI, she was the CEO of the International Business Leaders Forum and managing director of MTV Networks, Nordics. Rogers is the cofounder and executive director of GDI. Before GDI, he founded and led Terbium Labs, an information security and dark web intelligence startup, and worked in the American intelligence community. He also serves as an adjunct professor at New York University and is a fellow at the Truman National Security project where Biden National Security Advisor, Jake Sullivan, is a Board Member. Sullivan was one of the ringleaders of the Trump/Russia disinformation narrative. The Daily Caller News Foundation reported that GDI also receives taxpayer money from the U.S. State Department\u2019s, Global Engagement Center (GEC). GDI found that the sites at the highest risk for spreading disinformation \u201cpublished content with far fewer fact-based Ledes and far more Bias, Negative targeting and Sensational language than the rest of the sample.\u201d GDI holds that bias, sensationalism, and targeting often result in disinformation. Critically, GDI does not even purport to say which outlets disseminate actual disinformation \u2013 but rather, they purport to say which outlets are at risk of spreading disinformation. The analysis appears to be only forward-looking, trying to divine which outlets may spread disinformation in the future. However, many of GDI\u2019s most trustworthy outlets may have spread, according to GDI\u2019s own definition, disinformation in the past. In effect, GDI creates a system like Tom Cruise\u2019s famous \u201cMinority Report,\u201d where the disinformation think tank will attempt to predict if an outlet is in danger of spreading disinformation. GDI said in their interim report that disinformation often relates to adversarial, sensational, and targeting reporting, not necessarily reporting that is false. The organization defines disinformation as \u201c adversarial narratives , which are intentionally misleading; financially or ideologically motivated; and/or, aimed at fostering long-term social, political or economic conflict; and which create a risk of harm by undermining trust in science or targeting at-risk individuals or institutions.\u201d Many of GDI\u2019s least risky websites have often exhibited bias, pushed false narratives, and sensationalized stories. These outlets have more of an impact on the American online media landscape as they are often considered the \u201cpaper of record,\u201d such as the New York Times , or are ubiquitous wire services relied upon for their speed and accuracy by nearly every outlet in the country. Breitbart News has reported some of the issues facing GDI\u2019s most trustworthy outlets. They include blatant disinformation about a Russian missile strike in Poland, the Hunter Biden laptop story, and nonexistent Trump-Russia collusion. HuffPost GDI says that HuffPost \u201cfeatured fact-based, unbiased content free from sensational text or visuals.\u201d Here are some of the more controversial pieces of actual disinformation HuffPost has shared: HuffPost, has to this day, yet to retract reporting questioning the veracity of the contents from the Hunter Biden laptop, even though other outlets on this list of reputable sources, such as the New York Times , have confirmed the authenticity of the Hunter Biden laptop. An October 2020 report from HuffPost still claims that there is \u201cno evidence by either Biden [Hunter or Joe].\u201d Karen Geier, a Guardian and HuffPost contributor, in 2018 expressed hope on Twitter that North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un would \u201cdrop a bomb on CPAC.\u201d Andy Ostroy, a political and culture blogger at HuffPost, targeted Sen. Tim Scott (R-SC) in December 2017, calling him a \u201cblack \u2026 prop\u201d during then-President Donald Trump\u2019s celebration of the passage of the Trump Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. In April 2017, the South African edition of HuffPost published an opinion piece calling to disenfranchise white men to advance the \u201cprogressive cause.\u201d A HuffPost blog writer wrote in January 2017 that failed presidential candidate Hillary Clinton\u2019s inability to win 20 states during the 2016 presidential election means that she is the \u201clegitimate president-elect.\u201d A November 2018 HuffPost story claimed that Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer , a Christmas film, is a \u201cproblematic\u201d \u201cmarginalized reindeer.\u201d New York Times The Times, the \u201cGray Lady,\u201d and the \u201cPaper of Record,\u201d are just a few of the names that have described the venerable station that the New York Times has in society as the quintessential paper in America. However, the paper has lost its way, more so than just covering up the massacre of millions of people under the Soviet Union in the 1930s. Here are some of their latest controversies: In March 2022, the Times casually mentioned in an article that the Laptop from Hell, Hunter Biden\u2019s laptop, was authentic and reported extensively on by Breitbart News Political Editor Emma-Jo Morris at the New York Post , despite originally reporting it as \u201cbaroque mythology.\u201d The \u201claptop from hell\u201d also captured international headlines when she, along with Miranda Devine, revealed that Joe Biden was intimately involved in Hunter\u2019s businesses, appearing to even have a 10 percent stake in a company the scion formed with officials at the highest levels of the Chinese Communist Party. It was only years after left-leaning outlets, such as the Times and many others on this list, confirmed for themselves that the laptop from hell was indeed authentic after the pivotal 2020 presidential election. Arthur Sulzberger Jr., chairman of the New York Times Company and newspaper publisher, described it as a \u201chuge black eye.\u201d \u201dIt\u2019s an abrogation of the trust between the newspaper and its readers,\u201d he added. Former FBI Director James Comey said in June 2017 that the New York Times\u2019s reporting on President Donald Trump\u2019s alleged collusion with the Russian government during the 2016 presidential election was \u201cnot true.\u201d The New York Times executive editor Dean Baquet accidentally admitted in August 2019 that the paper was \u201cbuilt\u201d around spreading the Russia collusion hoax, which GDI should note, as they evaluate \u201cdisinformation\u201d based on sensationalism. The New York Times corrected influential reporter Maggie Haberman\u2019s article to note that only four intelligence agencies, not 17, had assessed that Russia attempted to influence the 2016 presidential election. In June 2020, the Pentagon released a statement rebuking the New York Times after the outlet claimed that a Russian military intelligence unit secretly offered bounties to Taliban-linked militants to kill U.S. and coalition forces in Afghanistan. The New York Times reported that most of the United States\u2019 east coast beaches would be gone as a result of climate change and rising sea levels (east coach beaches are still there). The New York Times became engulfed in scandal in 2003 when reporter Jayson Blair resigned after an investigation found the journalist engaged in widespread fabrication of sources and plagiarized in at least 36 of the 73 articles Blair wrote since he started receiving assignments with the outlet. The New York Times , along with the Washington Post and USA Today , had to issue corrections after falsely reporting that then-President Donald Trump enacted a policy to separate border-crossing parents from their children at the southern border. Washington Post The Washington Post has been touted by GDI as a paper that largely avoids sensational or negatively targeted reporting, even though it has occasional bias. It has been rated as such despite the outlet\u2019s rampant targeting of then-President Donald Trump and his administration. The Post claimed in a piece that Russian leader Vladimir Putin admitted that he has compromising information about Trump. The Times , the Post , the AP, and the Wall Street Journal also reported this claim. The Post claimed that Russia hacked the election systems of 21 American states; a claim that outlets like the Post would now likely say would undermine faith in the democratic system. The Post , now owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, had to issue a correction to a January 2021 story in which Trump allegedly told a Georgia state elections investigator to \u201cfind the fraud.\u201d In reality, the audio revealed Trump said nothing of the kind. The Post had also claimed that Jacob Blake, who was shot in Kenosha, Wisconsin, last year, was unarmed, where in fact, video evidence shows him holding a knife at the time of his shooting. The Washington Post even reported an imaginary meeting between Trump and then-Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Chairman Ajit Pai; the outlet had been sharply critical of Pai\u2019s efforts to repeal the Obama-era net neutrality regulations. The Post had to admit they lied after pretending a September statement by Donald Trump Jr. in Georgia in October 2021 was \u201cLet\u2019s go, Brandon,\u201d and not \u201cF*ck Joe Biden.\u201d The Post , the Times, and USA Today , had to issue corrections after corrections after falsely claiming that Trump enacted a policy to separate children at the southern border. Associated Press The Associated Press serves a vital role in the American media landscape; as a wire service, outlets rely on it for quick and thorough stories. It also carries the important role of declaring election victories. But, it also falls prey to fake news and has pushed false and sensational narratives, or, in GDI\u2019s words, disinformation. The AP recently botched a breaking news story in which then-AP investigative reporter James LaPorta wrote, citing a senior U.S. intelligence official, that a Russian missile crossed into NATO-member Poland, killing two people. The story set off an international firestorm, in which many wondered if this meant that NATO countries would go to war with a nuclear-armed Russia. The Associated Press also in July 2017 released a similar statement to the New York Times which clarified that three U.S. intelligence agencies \u2014 not 17 \u2014 assessed that Russia attempted to interfere in the 2016 presidential election. In June 2017 the AP invented an imaginary meeting between then-EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt and Dow Chemical Andrew Liveris and then alleged some kind of \u201cimpropriety\u201d happened during the meeting. The AP claimed in late November that Republicans have not provided evidence that President Joe Biden and his son Hunter have \u201cspoken\u201d about the family\u2019s foreign business dealings, where, in reality, Republicans submitted a recording of a Joe Biden voicemail for Hunter about a business deal with a Chinese energy company. Further, Republicans have detailed that whistleblowers reveal how Joe Biden was intimately involved with the Biden family business. National Public Radio (NPR) Here are a few of the high-profile stories that NPR got wrong: NPR made the false claim in 2018 that Donald Trump Jr.\u2019s Senate testimony about a Trump Tower deal in Moscow conflicted with testimony from Michael Cohen. NPR in April 2021 corrected an article that claimed that reports about emails on Hunter Biden\u2019s laptop had been \u201cdiscredited by U.S. intelligence and independent investigations by news organizations.\u201d NPR falsely claimed that Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor had to work remotely because Justice Neil Gorsuch refused to wear a mask. ProPublica ProPublica is a George Soros-funded left-wing investigative site built to attack conservatives. Yet, GDI describes ProPublica as a \u201cnonprofit with an emphasis on investigative journalism,\u201d while ignoring its funding from the fanatical Soros. Outside of the outlet\u2019s bias, ProPublica has botched stories. In February 2018, the outlet accused then-CIA Director nominee Gina Haspel of overseeing a CIA \u201cblack site\u201d where terrorist Abu Zubaydah \u201c was subjected to waterboarding and other coercive interrogation methods that are widely seen as torture.\u201d ProPublica even claimed that Haspel \u201cmocked the prisoner\u2019s suffering in private conversation.\u201d ProPublica now states, \u201cNeither of these assertions is correct and we retract them. It is now clear that Haspel did not take charge of the base until after the interrogation of Zubaydah ended.\u201d To make matters worse, she was not at the alleged black site at the time. GDI downranks outlets for targeting and agenda-driven journalism; ProPublica was ranked as one of the most trustworthy outlets despite the outlet soliciting aid from the public to uncover who then-Supreme Court Justice nominee Brett Kavanaugh invited to Washington Nationals\u2019 baseball games. USA Today \u201c USA Today received a low-risk rating based on strong scores across the board. The site could improve in terms of relying on a wide range of sources and being sure to clearly attribute statistics, quotations and external media,\u201d GDI wrote of USA Today . However, the highly syndicated paper was engulfed in scandal and has reported disinformation, including: USA Today faced a dramatic scandal, in which USA Today had to remove 23 articles from its website after an internal investigation found that one of its reporters had fabricated sources and misappropriated quotes for stories. Breitbart News\u2019s senior John Nolte lit into USA Today for presenting the Hunter Biden laptop expos\u00e9 as Russian disinformation. USA Today claimed in September 2017 that Russia attempted to hack the election systems of 21 American states. Breitbart News reported that USA Today between November 2021 and April 2022, received $230,000 in advertising expenses from the Chinese Communist Party-controlled China Daily. Executives at USA Today in 2022 declared Dr. Rachel Levine, the transgender assistant secretary for health at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), one of the nominees for USA Today\u2019s women of the year. Mike Freeman, a sports columnist at USA Today , in September 2022 labeled doubters of a \u201cracist heckling\u201d controversy as \u201cright-wing conspiracy theorists.\u201d Brigham Young University later found there was no evidence of a fan yelling the n-word at a black Duke volleyball player. USA Today edited Georgia Democrat Stacey Abrams\u2019s op-ed in which she suggested she supported a Major League Baseball decision to pull its All-Star game out of Atlanta after the state passed an election integrity law. The edits made it appear that she opposed the calls to boycott having the All-Star game in the Peach State. USA Today\u2019s Hemal Jhaveri was fired in March 2021 after saying in the aftermath of a mass shooting in Boulder, Colorado, that \u201cit\u2019s always an angry white man.\u201d The police said the shooter was a Syrian-born suspect. USA Today in June 2020 used an article written by an intern to fact-check a Breitbart News article to assert that amnesty only refers to a permanent pardon, despite that many outlets, such as the New York Times , The Atlantic, the Wall Street Journal , and NPR also refer to temporary relief as amnesty. The fact-check led to Meta to restrict access to the Breitbart News article on a Breitbart News Instagram post. A USA Today sports columnist suggested in September 2018 that Supreme Court Justice nominee Brett Kavanaugh \u201cshould stay off basketball courts\u201d when children are around and not coach girls\u2019 basketball in light of the sexual assault accusation against him. USA Today , along with the New York Times and Washington Post , in June 2018 had to issue corrections after falsely claiming that then-President Donald Trump enacted a policy to separate border-crossing parents from their children at the U.S.-Mexico border. BuzzFeed GDI scored BuzzFeed News highly based on \u201cneutrality and journalistic best practices,\u201d despite the former editor-in-chief Ben Smith becoming infamous for, what Breitbart News coined, \u201cBenSmithing.\u201d In the words of the New York Times , BenSmithing is: What is BenSmithing? To the Republicans who coined the term last year, it refers to writing an article that supposedly tackles a Democratic Party scandal, but is actually intended to dismiss the issue, something they believe Mr. Smith did often for President Obama. Here are some of BuzzFeed\u2019s stories that could be perceived as spreading disinformation: BuzzFeed published the infamous and unverified \u201cpee dossier\u201d about President Donald Trump. BuzzFeed has been labeled as a safe news source by other disinformation organizations, such as Microsoft partner and browser plug-in provider NewsGuard despite their reporting fake news: Buzzfeed released a bombshell report in 2019, citing two unidentified law enforcement officials, which alleged that President Trump directed then-personal attorney Michael Cohen to lie to Congress and that he regularly told the president and his family about the Trump Tower project in Moscow, Russia. Special Counsel Robert Mueller came out in a rare statement and said that the BuzzFeed report was \u201cnot accurate.\u201d BuzzFeed\u2019s false report caused such a stir that House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-CA) said that he would \u201cabsolutely\u201d investigate the report. A spokesperson for then-special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s office released a statement stating that a BuzzFeed report alleging that Trump directed his former attorney Michael Cohen to make false statements to Congress was inaccurate. The Global Disinformation Index, as a foreign think tank, has injected itself into the American landscape to blacklist conservative media outlets in order to choke off their advertising revenue via its Dynamic Exclusion List. Meanwhile, it ignores the past inaccuracies, biases, and targeting narratives of establishment, left-wing outlets such as the New York Times, HuffPost, NPR, and the Associated Press.

    "content": "Players form is crucial to their success and the likes of Ronalo have been consistant for 20+ years whilst some stars are still starting out or only have a few seasons under their belt. A great player moving to a notable club can sometimes mean less playing time on the pitch, so less opportunity to score goals. The world cup, Ballon d\u2019Or winner, fifa, all help us populate this 10 but narrowing down the world\u2019s best strikers to the top 10 is a proper challenge, but we\u2019ve had a shot at compiling a list based on long-term success as well as their current level of ability. We sure you\u2019re probably going to disagree with us\u2026 We\u2019re kind enough to ignore the occasional dip in form as trophies, vital stats and their impact for club and country are the key currency. Now, the sport\u2019s evolution has facilitated the diversification of goalscoring, and strikers are no longer merely tasked with hitting the target. Still, it\u2019s their primary goal (pun very much intended), right? However, when assessing the very best strikers in the world, the rate at which they score isn\u2019t the be-all and end-all. The development and subsequent complexity of the role mean various factors have to be accounted for. Here are our top 10 strikers in the world right now. Lautaro Martinez, Dusan Vlahovic, Olivier Giroud, Antoine Griezmann and Gabriel Jesus are just five of the names that have fallen agonisingly short, which gives you a clue of the strength in depth below. Let\u2019s get to the top 10! A controversial end to his second spell at Old Trafford and subsequent free transfer to Al Nassr of Saudi Arabia has probably taken a bit of gloss off the final years of Cristiano Ronaldo\u2019s career, but the five-time Ballon d\u2019Or winner will be remembered as one of the best players in the history of the game. A return of 24 goals in 38 appearances in all competitions for Manchester United in their disastrous 2021/22 campaign was a fine return and he became the first man to score at five World Cups when netting for Portugal at Qatar 2022. Ronaldo is a prolific goalscorer, a prolific trophy winner and even has an international airport named in his honour. Does it get any better than that? Probably the least established name on the list but, arguably, one of the most exciting with his electric pace and off-the-ball runs. Victor Osimhen was scoring at a decent rate for former club Lille and current side Napoli but he\u2019s taken his game to new heights this season and is set to lead the Italian club to Serie A glory. It is likely to be the first of many titles for Osimhen and a mega-money move to one of the continent\u2019s biggest clubs is surely on the cards. Liverpool\u2019s problems probably run a little deeper than Sadio Man\u00e9 leaving for Bayern Munich, but their attack just hasn\u2019t functioned without the Senegalese star. A hard-fought climb to the top and his philanthropy efforts make Man\u00e9 one of the most likeable characters in the game, but he\u2019s a manager\u2019s dream as he does the dirty work off the ball and is effective on it. His CV is littered with silverware and leading Senegal to the Africa Cup of Nations last year will probably go down as the highlight of his career. Neymar is undoubtedly one of the most talented players to have ever graced the game thanks to his killer first touch and sensational dribbling skills. The former Santos star did his best work at Barcelona as part of the famed MSN attack alongside Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez, but he\u2019s also played a huge role in establishing PSG as the dominant team in France. Neymar is level with the iconic Pele as the leading goalscorer for Brazil, but it will feel like his CV is a little undercooked if he fails to lead his country to World Cup glory or PSG to the Champions League title. A man that is ageing like a fine wine, Robert Lewandowski continues to find the back of the net at an astonishing rate. He is averaging nearly a goal a game in his maiden campaign for Barcelona, although that is slightly down on the frankly absurd numbers he posted for Bayern Munich. A big, strong lad that is hardly lacking a turn of foot, the Polish international does his best work in the box thanks to his superb positioning, movement and finishing. What hasn\u2019t he won? Well, the Ballon d\u2019Or but he would have landed the prestigious award in 2020 had voting not been cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic. Harry Kane is now the all-time leading goalscorer for Tottenham and England \u2013 however a lack of silverware makes it tough to include him in the top five. Individual honours including three Premier League Golden Boots and the 2018 World Cup Golden Boot no doubt take pride of place on the mantelpiece in the Kane household but he is approaching his 30th birthday without a league or cup to his name. As well as being a deadeye finisher, Kane has evolved his game over the years by dropping deep and linking up play. What hasn\u2019t been said about Erling Haaland? The part-man, part-robot is a goalscoring machine and the most deadly number nine in the game. The 22-year-old Norwegian is scoring at a rate of more than a goal a game for Manchester City following a blockbuster switch from Borussia Dortmund last summer, although there has been some criticism about other aspects of his game. As well as individual honours such as the 2020 Golden Boy, Haaland is a two-time Austrian Bundesliga winner but you suspect bigger prizes and pots are on the way. The most recent winner of the Ballon d\u2019Or has enjoyed a second wind as Real Madrid\u2019s main man in attack following the departure of Cristiano Ronaldo from the Bernabeu in 2018. Karim Benzema is another player in the latter years of his career that is still somehow improving and he enjoyed his best ever season in 2021/22 as his 44 goals in 46 games in all competitions helped Los Blancos to Champions League and La Liga glory. He combines terrific movement in the box with an incredible ability to find the back of the net, which makes him a fine focal point in attack. At the age of 35, Lionel Messi proved at the Qatar World Cup that there is still plenty of magic left in his boots after inspiring Argentina to the biggest prize in the game. There\u2019s really not much left to say about Messi at this point in his career. The seven-time Ballon d\u2019Or winner has won all there is to win, he\u2019s left his mark on the game and remains a joy to watch. The GOAT\u2026 but he\u2019s not number one on this list! If money was no object and you could take any player in the world for your team, Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 would surely be the most popular pick. Dancing feet, lightning pace and clinical finishing makes the Frenchman the most exciting footballer on the planet and his hat-trick against Argentina in the World Cup final underlines his status as the top dog in the game as the Messi and Ronaldo era draws to a close. The Champions League is the only major title missing from his trophy cabinet and the 2022 World Cup Golden Boot winner is bound to land the Ballon d\u2019Or sooner or later. At the age of 24, Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 has the world at his feet and he\u2019s got the edge on Erling Haaland as they emerge as the top dogs in the post-Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo rivalry era. While Champions League success has eluded him, you would expect Mbapp\u00e9 will get his hands on that trophy at some point.",

    "content": "The NFT market on the Ethereum blockchain saw a sharp decline in market capitalization in 2022, according to a from DappRadar. Despite being a key driver of the dapp industry, its market cap is estimated at $3.7 billion, a decrease of 59.60% in USD value from the beginning of the year. Despite this setback, the NFT market is showing positive signs of recovery, with a 68% increase in value from November 2022 to $3.7 billion. Yuga Labs, a leading player in the NFT industry, holds 67% of the Ethereum NFT market cap. In 2022, the NFT market saw a boom in growth and hype, reaching its highest value of $19.1 billion in February. However, this growth was not sustainable, and the Terra Luna collapse in May 2022 and FTX collapse in November had a devastating impact on the NFT market. These events decreased value from $19.1 billion to $2.2 billion by the end of November. Despite these challenges, the NFT market is showing promising signs of recovery, with the market cap closing the year at $3.7 billion and positive on-chain metrics seen in January 2023. Yuga Labs has established itself as a leading player in the NFT industry, with its NFT collections holding 67% of the entire Ethereum NFT market value. CryptoPunks and Bored Ape Yacht Club are two of the most highly valued NFT collections, holding 46.7% of the Ethereum market cap. Bored Ape Yacht Club, in particular, stands out as the first NFT collection to offer full ownership and commercial usage rights to its owners. However, despite its strong start in 2022 with a market cap evaluation of $2.6 billion, the Bored Ape Yacht Club experienced a 64.92% decrease in its market cap by the end of the year. In spite of these challenges faced by the Ethereum NFT market in 2022, many promising projects emerged from the bear market, showcasing the potential of unique digital assets. The NFT market continues to grow, with the number of brands and use cases adopting digital collectibles rising. As the market continues to evolve, it will be interesting to see how the Ethereum NFT market develops in the coming years. Related Reading |",

For businesses, both in and outside of the metaverse, it can be hard to imagine what the immersive virtual world will ultimately look like and how to prepare for it. What will your customers expect? How can businesses gain traction there? What will you need to know to stay ahead? We use the internet for pretty much everything. We shop in online stores, stay in touch with friends on social media, date, research and take online courses. In short, we use the internet to make everyday life easier and more productive. It\u2019s likely that we\u2019ll end up using the metaverse for similar purposes. A great question all businesses should ask themselves to start is: How can the metaverse generate value for your customers? Many startups believe that a good metaverse will enhance real-life interactions rather than replace them and that it\u2019s this generation\u2019s responsibility to decide what the space will become. Think of creators using 3D holographic components in their work meetings or going on a hike before class with parents or friends who live in a different city. However, the virtual reality experience of today is more immersive, and the four ways businesses operating in the metaverse can revolutionize the customer experience are as follows. Personalization is already popular online, so it should be no surprise that it plays an essential role in the metaverse. Whether shopping online or visiting a physical store, businesses can find it difficult to personalize the experience for every customer using conventional methods. Fortunately, the metaverse can ensure every customer has a unique experience when visiting an online store. Instead of viewing items that are of no interest, customers can visit stores tailored to their specific needs. Furthermore, the metaverse promotes connectivity, meaning users can check reviews of products and services before making a purchase and also share their experiences with other users in the metaverse. In the past, trials have often been limited to digital products, but this is no longer the case, thanks to the metaverse. As well as providing customers with an immersive virtual reality experience, the metaverse also employs augmented reality (AR). Visualizing a piece of furniture or item in the home always came down to a customer\u2019s imagination. Today, apps have allowed customers to take advantage of augmented reality in a limited form, but the metaverse will enable customers to enjoy an up close and personal vantage point of the product. Similarly, those providing personal experiences like holidays can use the metaverse to allow potential travelers to explore their options in more detail and search various layouts of hotels to find suitable accommodation. Although plenty of promotional benefits are available for businesses using the metaverse, it also allows customers to connect with people, places and brands that interest them. In addition to free trials of real-life experiences, businesses can offer customer experiences that allow them to explore their interests in more detail without leaving home. The metaverse is the perfect substitute for those who find that attending events in real-life is not always possible or affordable. Straightforward navigation means users will be exploring a metaverse designed around their interests and can enjoy affordable front-row access to several experiences with a level of immersion that has to be experienced to be understood. Nowadays, a business offers more than a product or service \u2014 it provides guidance and support. Although already present on many websites, the metaverse aims to build on the connection businesses can build with customers, meaning that companies have the capability of making organic connections with customers that have not been possible using conventional technology. The way businesses connect with customers in the metaverse is only the start of the journey. Companies that embrace the benefits the metaverse can offer ensure that customers enjoy a tailored experience that evolves at the same pace as the metaverse. The metaverse is arriving, which means it\u2019s time for businesses to hop on and become early adopters of the virtual train before it leaves the station. While the metaverse becomes the next frontier of internet technology and improving customer experiences, taking steps to massive adoption and accessibility is key. For business owners, it\u2019s essential to start understanding how these virtual worlds work, what opportunities and challenges there are, and how to take advantage sooner than later.",

    "content": "While Satoshi Nakamoto is credited as the anonymous creator of Bitcoin ( BTC ), what often goes unnoticed are the selfless contributions of the community members \u2014 miners, developers, designers, hodlers and investors \u2014 that help materialize the original vision. However, one such significant contribution was found to carry an imperfection for over 12 years, invisible to the naked eye. On Nov. 12, 2010, bitcointalk.org member bitboy (not related to YouTuber BitBoy Crypto) posted the vector files of the iconic Bitcoin logo, which has been widely accepted worldwide. While Bitcoiners preach the \u201czoom out\u201d narrative during crypto bear markets, zooming in on the original Bitcoin logo shows a small orange line from the background going into the white colored \u201c\u20bf.\u201d A small design detail that has stayed with many iterations of the original #bitcoin logo since its inception in 2010 pic.twitter.com/nYElwD2S6v The information was first revealed by Crypto Twitter member @_Bosch_, who then shared an updated Bitcoin logo after removing the mark and improving the stylistic proportions. On further investigation, community member @skyler_fs found that one of the curvatures of the \u20bf logo was not smooth either. Cointelegraph\u2019s investigation of the above claims confirmed the imperfections sported by the original Bitcoin vectors . The image below shows the two locations where the microscopic design issues exist. The revelation does not impact how Bitcoin operates and community members have not shown any concerns about it. Even if someone were to create new vectors after fixing the flaws, it would not gain mainstream acceptance unless the community decides otherwise. Related: Is it possible to achieve financial freedom with Bitcoin? As markets maintain a positive trajectory toward recovery, Bitcoin mining firm CleanSpark continues to amass equipment from distressed mining companies. CleanSpark\u2019s chief financial officer Gary Vecchiarelli said that the company envisions \u201cexplosive growth\u201d in 2023 through mergers and acquisitions. \u201cWith respect to our strategy regarding M&A, we have been one of the most active miners to date in acquiring infrastructure and machines, and we will continue to be active,\u201d he added.",

    "description": "Jalen Brunson said playing with Josh Hart at Villanova helped him become an NBA player. But it was also dangerous at times facing him in practice.",
    "content": "PHILADELPHIA \u2014 Jalen Brunson cracked a smile ever so slightly, allowing himself a moment of levity after the Knicks\u2019 frustrating loss to the 76ers. Yes, Brunson said, playing with Josh Hart at Villanova helped him become an NBA player. But it was also dangerous at times going up against him in practice. \u201cHe tried to kill me a couple times for sure,\u201d Brunson said after the Knicks\u2019 119-108 loss to the 76ers on Friday night. \u201cYou\u2019re laughing and I\u2019m dead serious.\u201d Hart, who was acquired by the Knicks from the Trail Blazers in a deal Tursday that also included the Hornets and 76ers, certainly has an edge to him. Brunson saw that up close for two years at the Big East school. He will get to experience it again now with the Knicks. \u201cHe\u2019s a tough-minded guy,\u201d Brunson said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t back down from a challenge and that\u2019s how he is and that\u2019s how he\u2019s been. I\u2019m not worried at all. He\u2019s going to fit in.\u201d Hart was on-hand Friday, but wasn\u2019t active. He is expected to make his Knicks debut at the Garden on Saturday night against the Jazz. His role is uncertain. Coach Tom Thibodeau didn\u2019t say if he planned to start Hart or bring him off the bench. Thibodeau doesn\u2019t believe it\u2019s who starts that is important, but who finishes. Hart averaged 9.5 points, 8.2 rebounds and 3.9 assists in 33.4 minutes for the Trail Blazers. He keyed a win for Portland over the Knicks at the Garden on Nov. 25, when he had 10 points, 19 rebounds, four assists and two steals. At the time, Thibodeau called him the best rebounding guard in the league. The Knicks need help in that area. They are tied for 19th in the league in defensive rebounding percentage at 71.3 and 21st in second-chance points allowed per game (14.3). Hart is fourth among guards in the NBA in the defensive rebounding percentage at 18.9, trailing only Luka Doncic, Jarrett Culver and Jayson Tatum. \u201cThe thing that I like about him is just his competitive spirit, so I think you can put him on a primary scorer and he\u2019ll make that person work,\u201d Thibodeau said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if you really measure [this] statistically. I think his toughness is a big thing and that\u2019s something that we need.\u201d It seems that Hart will fit in well with the second unit of Quickley, Obi Toppin and Isaiah Hartenstein, a group that can really get out in transition. He is very familiar with Brunson, too, and started all 51 games he appeared in for Portland this year. \u201cHe does a lot. He can do everything. And I think with him, he has a mindset of whatever the team needs, he can fulfill that,\u201d Brunson said. \u201cThat\u2019s how he\u2019s always been since [Villanova] and he\u2019s gotten better and better at it each year. He\u2019s just a competitor and he\u2019s just a guy that wants to win and will do whatever it takes just to win.\u201d",

    "content": "PHOENIX \u2014 Landon Dickerson was a college teammate of Evan Neal\u2019s for two seasons at Alabama, a football program that produces all sorts of high-end NFL prospects, including first-rate offensive linemen. Dickerson, a second-round pick of the Eagles in 2021, made the Pro Bowl in his second year and will start at left guard in Super Bowl LVII on Sunday. Neal, the No. 7 overall pick in the 2022 draft, went through an up-and-down rookie year with the Giants . \u201cGreat teammate, good dude,\u2019\u2019 Dickerson told The Post. \u201cHe can be quiet at times. I was with him in his younger years at Alabama. He didn\u2019t say a whole lot, but when he did he could be funny when he wanted to, he always knew how to have a good time, he always came to work every day trying to get better.\u2019\u2019 Dickerson said his improvement from Year 1 to Year 2 with the Eagles was significant. He predicts similar progress from Neal for the 2023 season. \u201cThe more you do something the more experience you get at it,\u2019\u2019 Dickerson said. \u201cThe NFL in itself is an adjustment and for him, getting used to the guys he\u2019s playing around, the speed of the game, how the offense is run, the more time you spend in it the better you get at it.\u2019\u2019 Chiefs coach Andy Reid will lead his team on the field in Arizona on Sunday, but if things had gone differently, he may have been the Cardinals coach in Arizona. After the Eagles fired Reid in 2013, the Cardinals were interested in hiring him. He was supposed to board a plane and fly to Arizona to meet with Cardinals officials, but Chiefs owner Clark Hunt and members of the Kansas City organization flew to Philadelphia and conducted a nine-hour interview with Reid. The plane to take him to Phoenix sat idly by and he never boarded it. \u201cThat was a long day,\u2019\u2019 Reid recounted this week. \u201cThe time flew by. I felt bad about the plane, though. It was waiting and I feel bad about that. But everybody involved knows that\u2019s part of the business.\u2019\u2019 Eagles receiver and punter returner Brittain Covey (hamstring) is the only player listed as questionable for either team on the final injury reports. Chiefs cornerback L\u2019Jarius Sneed (knee) was upgraded from limited participant Thursday to full participant Friday, when he took \u201cquite a few snaps,\u201d Reid said. The same goes for Dickerson (elbow), RT Lane Johnson (groin), C Cam Jurgens (hip), CB Avonte Maddox (toe) and DE Robert Quinn (foot) of the Eagles. The Eagles left practice Friday and went inside to simulate the long halftime break for the Super Bowl. The rehearsal was only seven minutes, but still required subsequent stretching and regaining intensity. Super Bowl LVII will be the third matchup between quarterbacks who finished first and second in the MVP vote that season. The trophy runner-up has won the previous three meetings, which is good news for Jalen Hurts. When the No. 1 seeds from both conferences meet in the Super Bowl, the underdog has won five straight times, according to PlaybookSports.com. That\u2019s good news for the Chiefs.",

    "content": "PHILADELPHIA \u2014 Derrick Rose is content with his role as a mentor. After the Knicks held onto the former MVP past the trade deadline this past Thursday, Rose said he hasn\u2019t even thought about looking to go elsewhere on a buyout. \u201cIt\u2019s still the same thing. I\u2019m still locked in with the team, talking to the guys, mentoring,\u201d he said after the Knicks\u2019 119-108 loss to the 76ers at Wells Fargo Center Asked if he\u2019s happy with his role, Rose jokingly wondered if he had looked upset on the bench. \u201cIf I was mad or something, I wouldn\u2019t be able to hide it,\u201d he said. Starting on Dec. 4, when coach Tom Thibodeau cut his rotation down to nine and replaced Rose with second-year guard Miles McBride, the former MVP has only appeared in five games. One of those instances came in Chicago as a homecoming cameo and the other four times were when the Knicks were shorthanded due to injury. Thibodeau has repeatedly said he believes Rose, who he has coached with three different teams, has value teaching the Knicks\u2019 young guards. \u201cI like to have him around me because he has a very positive impact on our group,\u201d Thibodeau said. Rose has a club option worth $15.6 million for next year.",

    "content": "Solana\u2019s Phantom Wallet, a secure non-custodial browser wallet, has announced the implementation of three new security standards for its users. In a on February 9th, the Solana-based wallet stated that it now supports three \u201cSign In With\u201d (SIW) standards: Sign In With X, Sign In With Ethereum, and Sign In With Solana. The introduction of these open standards aims to protect user privacy and improve the security of web3 authentication. By adopting one of these standards, decentralized applications (dApps) can prevent phishing attacks and the interception of sign-in messages. Signing messages is a common practice when connecting a wallet to a dApp. It is used to prove ownership of the wallet, allow dApps to store information connected to the address, and prevent unauthorized access to the account. However, generic sign-in messages are vulnerable to phishing attacks, where one domain can impersonate another and use the signed message to log in to a site on behalf of the user. SIW standards take the guesswork out of wondering if the user is vulnerable to such attacks. If a dApp opts-in to an open auth standard like CAIP-122 or EIP-4361, Phantom will validate the required message fields, such as the site\u2019s domain, the time at which the message was issued, and a nonce that prevents signature replay attacks. This added layer of security ensures that phishers cannot intercept generic sign-in messages and impersonate users. For Phantom users, this feature will not be noticeable. Phantom will only validate message fields if a dApp opts-in to one of the SIW formats. If a site opts-in to a SIW format and the required fields are invalid, Phantom will display a warning. Users who are confident that they are on the right site can choose to ignore the warning and sign the message. Looking ahead, Phantom believes that the ecosystem will eventually move towards fully adopting SIW standards as a chain-agnostic solution to generic sign-in messages. However, the implementation of these standards is an important step toward providing a secure and decentralized alternative to centralized identity providers. Nevertheless, the new SIW standards are entirely opt-in, and dApps that do not want to use them can continue to use generic messages as usual. This new feature is part of Phantom\u2019s suite of security features and will provide additional protection for Solana users. Related Reading |",

It is always scary to pick against Patrick Mahomes, but the Eagles are better at the line of scrimmage on both sides of the ball, and that is where they will win this game. Chiefs 24, Eagles 21: The Eagles have the more talented team, top-to-bottom. The Chiefs have the coach unafraid to inject a crazy call into the game and the quarterback who invents new tricks in the moment. A fake kick or no-look pass makes the difference. Chiefs 31, Eagles 27: The Eagles are a damn good team, and Jalen Hurts is a damn good quarterback. But Patrick Mahomes is the best player in the sport, and his Super Bowl experience will help him here. Mahomes to Kelce will be the difference. Eagles 31, Chiefs 23: The Chiefs have Patrick Mahomes, which means they always have a chance. The Eagles have the advantage in most other areas, though \u2014 especially up front \u2014 and it will take a meltdown from young QB Jalen Hurts to derail the Birds. Eagles 30, Chiefs 27: Patrick Mahomes is as close to 100 percent as his high ankle sprain will allow him to be, but he\u2019ll be working his jaw-dropping magic against a better defense than the one Jalen Hurts will begoing against. Hurts will be a dual threat. Mahomes cannot be. Chiefs 27, Eagles 21: The Eagles have barely broken a sweat in two playoff victories. But Patrick Mahomes is on the doorstep of adding a second ring to his legacy. That\u2019s the trump card.",

    "content": "About three hours before Josh Hart was set to debut for his new team, he posted on social media a photo of his No. 3 jersey hanging in his locker, along with the words \u201cIma f\u2013king Knick!\u201d The 27-year-old Hart was acquired Wednesday night in a deadline deal that sent Cam Reddish and a protected 2023 first-round pick to Portland, marking the third time he has been traded in his six NBA seasons. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely somewhere that I would definitely like to be,\u201d Hart said of New York before scoring 11 points and grabbing seven rebounds in his Knicks debut, a 126-120 win over the Jazz on Saturday at the Garden. \u201cIt\u2019s my third time getting traded, sixth year in the league, fourth team, sixth head coach. \u201cIt\u2019s been a whirlwind. I didn\u2019t think that was how my first six years were going to be, but I\u2019m looking for a home, and I think this could be it.\u201d Hart, who controls a player option for 2023-24 worth $12.96 million, began his career with the Lakers as the 30th overall pick of the 2017 draft before being traded to the Pelicans in the Anthony Davis blockbuster deal and then to the Trail Blazers at the trade deadline last year. The former Villanova star also was teammates with Jalen Brunson for two years , and they won one NCAA title together with the Wildcats. Hart also teamed up with Knicks All-Star forward Julius Randle for one season in Los Angeles. \u201cHaving relationships when you\u2019re going to a new team always helps. And it always when those guys are those guys,\u201d Hart said. \u201cThey\u2019re All-Star caliber players. I\u2019m looking to pick up where we left off. \u201cJalen and I had a lot of success at a different level, obviously. But we had success, we kept in touch. We know each other, we know each other\u2019s game. And same with Ju. So I\u2019m excited. It\u2019s definitely going to help me out to have those guys on the team and someone I\u2019m familiar with.\u201d Hart said he spoke with Brunson \u2014 whose number was retired Wednesday night at Villanova \u2014 soon after Brunson\u2019s viral video celebrating the trade hit social media . \u201cIt was dope, man. It was something that we\u2019ve talked about several times. It\u2019s something that we both wanted to do in our careers and, man, we\u2019re both excited,\u201d Hart said. \u201cWe\u2019re excited to be teammates, and we\u2019re both excited to be Knicks. I think that\u2019s the biggest thing.\u201d The 6-foot-5 guard averaged 9.5 points and 8.2 rebounds in 51 starts this season for the Blazers, including 19 rebounds in an overtime win at the Garden in November. After that game, Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau dubbed Hart \u201cthe best rebounding guard in the league.\u201d \u201cI should have had 20. I fouled out. Jalen gave me three damn fouls that game,\u201d Hart joked. \u201cI\u2019m a guy that\u2019s gonna bring it every night. I\u2019m a guy that\u2019s gonna be physical. I\u2019m a guy that\u2019s gonna do the dirty work. Going to rebound, going to defend. Get on the floor for a loose ball and do those kind of things. \u201cI feel like that style fits every team, especially a New York team. That\u2019s what this city is about and what the city builds off of. I take that with pride. I\u2019m just a blue collar guy. I think that\u2019s really going to work well here.\u201d Hart noted that he\u2019s always \u201cloved\u201d playing at the Garden, against St. John\u2019s or in the Big East tournament with Villanova, and as a pro. His style certainly fits the one preferred by Thibodeau, although the coach hasn\u2019t explained yet how he plans to use Hart within the Knicks\u2019 rotation. But the Knicks\u2019 front office clearly dealt for Hart to play significant minutes. \u201cI would love to, man. \u2026 Whenever Thibs calls my name, I gotta be ready, and that\u2019s what it\u2019s about in this league, just having that consistency,\u201d Hart said. \u201cSo, whether I play 48 minutes or I play 14 minutes, I gotta be ready to go out there and contribute and help this team, and if I\u2019m not doing that, then obviously I shouldn\u2019t be playing 48 minutes. I should be playing more like four minutes. So, I\u2019m relying on Thibs to take care of all that, and I\u2019m just out there just to play.\u201d",

    "content": "Richard Witt predicts the winner of Sunday\u2019s Super Bowl between the Philadelphia Eagles and Kansas City Chiefs : We find it hard to stray too much away from the fundamentals of the Chiefs-Eagles matchup . We\u2019re more comfortable where we stand than we were just a few days ago, but our basic perspective has not radically changed. Do we respect Patrick Mahomes and the monstrous, versatile Kansas City offense, even against a defense as good as Philadelphia\u2019s? For sure, but to not respect the defensive proposition in a game this significant would be folly, unless multiple significant injuries come into play in short order. We continue to suspect the offenses will maintain a meaningful edge versus the defenses they\u2019ll be facing. The two worthies you\u2019d expect to garner the bulk of the MVP attention (those top-drawer quarterbacks) continue to draw numerous hearts and eyeballs. It\u2019s a challenge to tear your attention away from Mahomes and the Eagles\u2019 Jalen Hurts. The four most recent Supes have trended toward more moderate Over/Under ledgers, with the last quartet featuring 43, 40, 51 and 16 points. The last two scoring explosions came when the Eagles made the most of their opportunities and took out the Patriots, 41-33, in the Super Bowl LII overtime hard-knocker. The Chiefs are blessed with a multiplicity of talented athletes on both sides of the ball. Even more impressively, they displayed an uncanny improvement advantage during the course of the season, though much of that could be attributed to their facing lesser quarterback talent during the final third of the campaign. We\u2019ll also readily agree that the Chiefs have proven themselves to be effective in varying defensive sets \u2014 not the least of which is their broad effectiveness when playing many varieties of zone defense, which has posed the Eagles\u2019 offensive talent sustained difficulties. And when you\u2019re talking about Hurts, you\u2019re talking about a quarterback who has been less than bulletproof when attempting to make optimal throws to his right, causing him considerable discomfort on multiple occasions. At first glance, I was considerably optimistic and bullish about the Eagles in this affair \u2014 especially if they came to the game relatively healthy, with most of the major players in reasonably good form and optimistic about the likely outcome from their sides\u2019 perspective. I currently believe that I was simply too optimistic about the level of stalwartness of the Eagles\u2019 defense during my early research, especially when you consider the degree of schedule (not all that tough, boys and girls) the Eagles found themselves coming up against during the course of the long, hard season. Bottom-lining this, I can\u2019t deny that the Eagles could turn out to be excruciatingly vulnerable to the size, type and style of offense that the Chiefs are likely to pitch at them for well over three hours on national television. I can still envision the Eagles winning, but they\u2019re going to have to get off to that snappy start that many of the optimists expected they will generate. When they have wrested early command, they have been the devil to beat, but when many things don\u2019t quite go precisely as they\u2019d like, they\u2019re not quite the locks to overcome all obstacles we originally envisioned. Last week: 1-1 Season: 124-118-3.",

    "content": "RALEIGH, N.C. \u2014 Vitali Kravtsov\u2019s reinstatement to active duty lasted one game and 10:46 of ice time. The 23-year-old Russian, scratched for the Rangers\u2019 6-2 win Saturday against the Hurricanes after he got a rather brief opportunity on the third line Friday against the Kraken, is likely going to be a chip (or fodder) played by general manager Chris Drury ahead of the March 3 trade deadline. Kravtsov had played on the right with Chris Kreider and Vincent Trocheck while Barclay Goodrow centered Jimmy Vesey and Julien Gauthier on the fourth line in the 6-3 victory over Seattle. He had one attempted shot that missed the net, and he was replaced down the stretch by the more defensively-committed Vesey and Goodrow for one shift apiece with the Rangers holding one- and two-goal leads. Head coach Gerard Gallant was asked whether he hadn\u2019t seen enough from Kravtsov or if he wanted a different look for this one, in which Vesey rejoined Trocheck and Kreider and Jake Leschyshyn skated between Goodrow and Gauthier. \u201cA little bit of both, actually,\u201d Gallant said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t disappointed in him, but we want a different mix for [Saturday]. So a combination of both.\u201d The match Friday represented Kravtsov\u2019s first game since Dec. 23, following four straight healthy scratches. He has registered six points (3-3) in 28 games, having been scratched 15 times while missing another 10 to assorted early-season injuries. Regarding Vesey \u2014 who played nine previous games with Trocheck and Kreider \u2014 and Goodrow, Gallant said, \u201cThey might be on the fourth line, but they\u2019re not fourth-line players.\u201d The Niko Mikkola-Braden Schneider pair had a tough night Friday after being united following just a morning skate. They were on for 11:32 while recording a 25 percent attempts rate (six for, 18 against) and an expected goals for of 22.67. The 6-foot-5 Mikkola, who is far more than merely an incidental piece of the Tarasenko trade package from St. Louis, picked up three minors Friday, though his third-period call for delay of game for allegedly shooting the puck into the stands was proved incorrect by video. Despite those issues, Gallant gave the tandem a regular turn over the final 10 minutes of the game. It has not been unusual for the team to cut down to two pairs over the final 10-12 minutes of contested games. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy coming into a new team without a practice,\u201d Gallant said. \u201cThey had a morning skate, but I thought he was good. He\u2019s exactly what we wanted. He\u2019s a big strong guy, and I think he\u2019s going to be real good for our group.\u201d The delay of game penalty on Mikkola at 8:20 of the third came only 1:59 after the Kraken had narrowed the Rangers\u2019 lead to 5-3. But the penalty-kill unit, featuring the Chris Kreider-Mika Zibanejad, Vesey-Goodrow, Trocheck-Kaapo Kakko tandems up front and the Adam Fox-Ryan Lindgren and K\u2019Andre Miller-Jacob Trouba pairs on the back, limited the Kraken to just one attempt \u2014 a Vince Dunn try from the left that was blocked by Trouba. Jaroslav Halak entered Saturday with a six-game winning streak, through which he had recorded a .926 save percentage and 2.16 goals-against average. Henrik Lundqvist was the last Rangers netminder to win seven straight starts when he went 7-0 from Dec. 8-27, 2014, with a .940 save percentage and 1.84 GAA. The Rangers will travel to Vancouver on Sunday, where they will practice twice before facing the Canucks on Wednesday. That precedes matches in Edmonton on Friday and Calgary on Saturday to conclude the trip.",

    "content": "Next to his college teammate Josh Hart once more, Jalen Brunson looked at home. And with each passing game, Brunson, who notably was not invited to the All-Star Game next Sunday in Salt Lake City, looks more like a certified snub. Brunson enjoyed another big game Saturday night in the Knicks\u2019 126-120 win over the Jazz at the Garden, when he reunited with his Villanova pal who came over from the Trail Blazers in a deadline trade. Hart and Brunson looked in synch \u2014 Brunson threw a long pass to jump-start a fastbreak and earn an assist on Hart\u2019s first field goal with the Knicks \u2014 as if no time had passed since they won the national title together at Villanova in 2016. Regardless of his teammates, Brunson has looked unstoppable for several weeks. He followed up a 20-point first quarter Friday in a loss at Philadelphia by adding 15 points on 6-for-8 shooting in the first period Saturday, setting the tone for a 38-point night that he finished well, too. With the game in the balance, Brunson went to work. He put Utah\u2019s Ochai Agbaji on his hip, drove and pulled up to give the Knicks a 108-105 lead halfway through the fourth. The Jazz tied it up before Brunson swished a step-back 3-pointer for a 112-109 lead they did not give back. After RJ Barrett drilled a triple of his own on the next possession, the Knicks could exhale. Brunson was first snubbed Feb. 2, when the All-Star reserves were announced without his name included. The All-Star injury replacements were selected Friday afternoon, when Anthony Edwards, De\u2019Aaron Fox, Pascal Siakam got the nod over the Knicks\u2019 outstanding point guard. In five games since the first snubbing, Brunson has averaged 31 points. The Jazz had no answers for Brunson, who could use his speed or strength to get whatever shot he wanted. He finished 11-for-22 from the floor \u2014 including 2-for-5 from downtown \u2014 and added five assists. Brunson went 14-for-15 from the foul line, sinking his final two with 29.1 seconds left. The Garden crowd serenaded the non-All-Star with \u201cMVP\u201d chants.",

    "description": "Turkish officials detained or issued arrest warrants for some 130 people allegedly involved in the construction of buildings that toppled down and crushed their occupants.",
    "content": "As rescuers still pulled a lucky few from the rubble six days after a pair of earthquakes devastated southeast Turkey and northern Syria, Turkish officials detained or issued arrest warrants for some 130 people allegedly involved in the construction of buildings that toppled down and crushed their occupants. The death toll from Monday\u2019s quakes stood at 28,191 \u2014 with another 80,000-plus injured \u2014 as of Sunday morning and was certain to rise as bodies kept emerging. As despair also bred rage at the agonizingly slow rescue efforts, the focus turned to who was to blame for not better preparing people in the earthquake-prone region that includes an area of Syria that was already suffering from years of civil war. Even though Turkey has, on paper, construction codes that meet current earthquake-engineering standards, they are too rarely enforced, explaining why thousands of buildings slumped onto their side or pancaked downward onto residents. Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay said late on Saturday that warrants have been issued for the detention of 131 people suspected to being responsible for collapsed buildings. Turkey\u2019s justice minister has vowed to punish anyone responsible, and prosecutors have begun gathering samples of buildings for evidence on materials used in constructions. The quakes were powerful, but victims, experts and people across Turkey are blaming bad construction for multiplying the devastation. Authorities at Istanbul Airport on Sunday detained two contractors held responsible for the destruction of several buildings in Adiyaman, the private DHA news agency and other media reported. The pair were reportedly on their way to Georgia. Two more people were arrested in the province of Gaziantep suspected of having cut down columns to make extra room in a building that collapsed, the state-run Anadolu Agency said. A day earlier, Turkey\u2019s Justice Ministry announced the planned establishment of \u201cEarthquake Crimes Investigation\u201d bureaus. The bureaus would aim to identify contractors and others responsible for building works, gather evidence, instruct experts including architects, geologists and engineers, and check building permits and occupation permits. A building contractor was detained by authorities on Friday at Istanbul airport before he could board a flight out of the country. He was the contractor of a luxury 12-story building in the historic city of Antakya, in Hatay province, the collapse of which left an untold number of dead. The detentions could help direct public anger toward builders and contractors , deflecting attention away from local and state officials who allowed the apparently sub-standard constructions to go ahead. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s government, already burdened by an economic downturn and high inflation, faces parliamentary and presidential elections in May. Advertisement Survivors, many of whom lost loved ones, have turned their frustration and anger also at authorities. Rescue crews have been overwhelmed by the widespread damage which has impacted roads and airports, making it even more difficult to race against the clock. Erdogan acknowledged earlier in the week that the initial response has been hampered by the extensive damage. He said the worst-affected area was 500 kilometers (310 miles) in diameter and was home to 13.5 million people in Turkey. During a tour of quake-damaged cities Saturday, Erdogan said a disaster of this scope was rare, and again referred to it as the \u201cdisaster of the century.\u201d Rescuers, including crews from other countries, continued to probe the rubble in hope of finding additional survivors who could yet beat the increasingly long odds. Thermal cameras were used to probe the piles of concrete and metal, while rescuers demanded silence so that they could hear the voices of the trapped. Two sisters were removed from the wreckage on Sunday in the city of Adiyaman, 153 hours after the quake, according to HaberTurk television, which also broadcast the live rescue of a 6-year-old boy removed from the debris of his home in Adiyaman. The child was wrapped in a space blanket and put into an ambulance. An exhausted rescuer removed his surgical mask and took deep breaths as a group of women could be heard crying in joy. Turkey\u2019s health minister, Fahrettin Koca, posted a video of a young girl in a navy blue jumper who was rescued. \u201cGood news at the 150th hour. Rescued a little while ago by crews. There is always hope!\u201d he tweeted. The efforts of a team of Italian and Turkish rescuers also paid off when they removed a 35-year-old man from the wreckage in the hard-hit city of Antakya. The man, Mustafa Sarigul, appeared to be unscathed as he was being transported on a stretcher to an ambulance, private NTV television reported. Overnight, a child was also freed in the town of Nizip, in Gaziantep, state-run Anadolu Agency reported, while a 32-year woman, was rescued from the ruins of a eight-story building in the city of Antakya. The woman, a teacher named Meltem, asked for tea as soon as she emerged, according to NTV. In Kahramanmaras, near the epicenter of the first 7.8 quake that struck early Monday morning, efforts were underway to reach a survivor detected by sniffer dogs beneath a now-pancaked seven-story building, NTV reported. Those found alive, however, remained the rare exception. A large makeshift graveyard was under construction in Antakya\u2019s outskirts on Saturday. Backhoes and bulldozers dug pits in the field as trucks and ambulances loaded with black body bags arrived continuously. The hundreds of graves, spaced no more than 3 feet (a meter) apart, were marked with simple wooden planks set vertically in the ground. The picture is less clear of the plight across the border in Syria. The death toll in Syria\u2019s northwestern rebel-held region has reached 2,166, according to the rescue worker group the White Helmets. The overall death toll in Syria stood at 3,553 on Saturday, though the 1,387 deaths reported for government-held parts of the country hadn\u2019t been updated in days.",

    "content": "If you've ever used an Android device, you're likely used to being able to choose a custom ringtone \u2014 all you have to do is open Settings and select a song or an audio clip. But iOS only offers generic, built-in sounds as ringtones. You can technically set up custom ringtones using a complicated workaround, but it involves a computer and iTunes (per How-To Geek ), which many iPhone owners don't even use anymore. Of course, all of this begs one question: why doesn't Apple simplify the process of using a custom ringtone on the iPhone? It's not a new problem, and many users have complained about it. Because the brand is famous for prioritizing seamlessness and simplicity, the fact that nothing has changed suggests that it's a deliberate decision on Apple's part. And it turns out that it is. We did a little digging to find out why Apple won't make the process as easy as it should be, and what we found is not surprising, but it's interesting all the same.",

    "content": "The 59-year-old musician shot to stardom alongside Paul Waaktaar-Savoy, and Morten Harket in the 80s with A-H whise big hit \u2018Take On Me\u2019 and Magne admits that they didn\u2019t enjoy being portrayed as pop pin-ups at the time. While A-ha is definitely not a one-hit wonder in its native country of Norway, the band only had one big hit in the US: \u201cTake On Me\u201d topped the charts in 1985. Much of the song\u2019s success can be attributed to its innovative music video, which combined live action and animation, making it perfect for heavy rotation on MTV. He explained: \u201cWe went along with it in the \u201980s but from the early \u201990s we kind of felt that we failed our music in many ways by feeding into the sort of pop idols. \u201cFame was confusing. We were young men who went from nobodies to the centre of attention wherever we went. We had people running after us. We were ducking, diving and calling the police for help. It was entertaining, but taxing. \u201cWe all suffered from the perception of the band in the early days which lingered for quite some time. One of the reasons I went into visual arts, and we all had solo projects, was to reset. We tried to get away from the stereotyping. \u201cMorten, obviously, bore the brunt of fame. He was the centre of attention and in interviews people were more curious about his biceps or hair than A-ha\u2019s actual music. But later, bands came out as fans \u2014 and people that you wouldn\u2019t necessarily expect like Morrissey, and we were huge Smiths fans. And Noel Gallagher, The Stone Roses and Coldplay. Kanye West used to dance to \u2018Take On Me\u2019 during his show.\u201d The band are now set to release their 11th studio album, \u2018True North\u2019. But Morten admits that the band \u2013 who live in different locations around the world \u2013 actually work better when they\u2019re not together. \u201cWorking separately has been very much the typical A-ha of the last decade. \u201cWe are very different, but we are three. And all three of us need to feel that we are free to do whatever feels right. \u201cI don\u2019t take part in the writing. I don\u2019t want to muscle my own stuff in between Pal and Mags. It doesn\u2019t really work, so I\u2019ve stopped doing it. \u201cAs a singer it\u2019s how I interpret things and engage in their songwriting. It\u2019s how the music speaks to me. I write for my solo work but for A-ha it works better like this.\u201d",

    "content": "The United States believes the unidentified objects shot down by American fighter jets over Canada and Alaska were balloons, though smaller than the China balloon downed over the Atlantic Ocean last weekend, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said Sunday. Schumer, D-N.Y., told ABC's \"This Week\" that he was briefed on Saturday night by President Joe Biden's national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, after the incident hours earlier over the Yukon. On Friday, an object roughly the size of a small car was downed over remote Alaska, according to the White House. Asked whether those two recent objects were balloons, Schumer said, \"They believe they were, yes, but much smaller than the first one.\" The government has said the first balloon was about the size of three school buses. It was shot down Feb. 4 off the South Carolina coast after it had traversed the United States. The Biden administration said it was used for surveillance. China claims it was on a meteorological research mission. Schumer said teams were recovering debris from the objects and would work to determine where they came from. The ones downed on Friday and Saturday were smaller and flying at a lower altitudes of about 40,000 feet, within the airspace occupied by commercial flights, compared with about 60,000 feet for the first one. \"The bottom line is until a few months ago we didn't know about these balloons,\" Schumer said. \"It is wild that we didn't know. ... Now they are learning a lot more. And the military and the intelligence are focused like a laser on first gathering and accumulating the information, then coming up with a comprehensive analysis.",

Having finished at the third position on the on the back of losing more matches than winning, Sunrisers deserved to lift the title after defeating table-toppers Capitals when it mattered the most. by the in the Indian Premier League, it is some co-incidence that a Hyderabad-based business has won the first season of a T20 tournament being played in South Africa. It is worth a mention that Deccan Chargers (owned by Deccan Chronicle though) had won the second season (first IPL season to be played in South Africa) of the IPL in 2009. The rescheduled final match required Sunrisers to score 136 runs in their 20-over quota in order to win the match. Powered by wicket-keeper batter Adam Rossington scoring a match-winning 57 (30) with the help of four fours and five sixes to set the tone first up because of his strike rate of 190, Sunrisers managed to seal the run-chase with four wickets and 3.4 overs left in the match. Sunrisers captain Aiden Markram bagged the Player of the Series award in SA20 2023. In addition to being the winning captain, Markram also emerged as the the third-highest run-scorer and joint seventh-highest wicket-taker in the competition. Markram, whose maiden T20 century in the semi-final against Joburg Super Kings played a crucial role in Sunrisers qualifying for the final, scored a total of 366 runs in 12 matches at an average of 33.27 and a strike rate of 127.97 throughout the season. More than just a handy off-spin bowler now, Markram\u2019s 11 wickets came at an average of 14.63, an economy rate of 6.19 and a strike rate of 14.1. \u201cWe were in a spot of bother [in the semi-final] and to come through for the team. It made me really happy. Overall, very happy with how it went [with the ball] and grateful for this award,\u201d Markram told during the post-match presentation ceremony.",

    "content": "A building believed to be the oldest surviving schoolhouse for Black children in the U.S. was hoisted onto a flatbed truck and moved a half-mile Friday to Colonial Williamsburg, a Virginia museum that continues to expand its emphasis on African American history. Built 25 years before the American Revolution, the original structure stood near the college campus of William & Mary. The pinewood building held as many as 30 students at a time, some of them free Black children studying alongside the enslaved. Hundreds of people lined the streets to celebrate its slow-speed trip into the heart of the living history museum, which tells the story of Virginia\u2019s colonial capital through interpreters and restored buildings. For historians and descendants alike, the Bray School contradicts the belief that all enslaved Americans were uneducated. But the school\u2019s faith-based curriculum \u2014 created by an English charity \u2014 also justified slavery and encouraged students to accept their fate as God\u2019s plan. \u201cReligion was at the heart of the school, and it was not a gospel of abolition,\u201d said Maureen Elgersman Lee, director of William & Mary\u2019s Bray School Lab. \u201cThere was this need to proselytize and to bring salvation while still not doing anything to destabilize the institution of slavery,\u201d Lee said. \u201cSave the soul, but continue to enslave the body. It was the here versus the hereafter.\u201d It was a brand of duplicity that fit easily into the larger contradictions of the country's founding, when the Democracy being forged explicitly denied rights and freedoms to many of its people. Williamsburg is less than 10 miles from Jamestown, which England established in 1607. The colony was supplied with enslaved Africans for labor just a dozen years later. A century and half after that, Black people, most of them still enslaved, represented just over half of Williamsburg\u2019s 2,000 people. The Bray School was established in 1760 at the recommendation of Benjamin Franklin, chairman of a London-based Anglican charity named after philanthropist Reverend Thomas Bray. The charity also set up schools in other cities, including New York and Philadelphia . The curriculum ranged from spellers to the Book of Common Prayer. But even within the schools\u2019 paternalistic framework, the education could still be empowering, perhaps even subversive. \u201cI was going through a facsimile of one of the books, and there are words like \u2018liberty,\u2019\u201d Lee said. \u201cWhat did learning those words do to expand these children\u2019s sense of themselves? Their sense of the world?\u201d Isaac Bee, a Bray School student, would run away as an adult from a slave owner named Lewis Burwell. An ad that Burwell placed in The Virginia Gazette in 1774 offered a cash bounty for his return and warned that Bee could read. Video: Small Oklahoma town holds rich history as one of state\u2019s original 'All Black' towns The white teacher, a widow named Ann Wager , lived upstairs at the school, and taught an estimated 300 to 400 students, whose ages ranged from 3 to 10, according to surviving records. The Williamsburg Bray School operated until 1774; only Philadelphia's reopened after the Revolutionary War. The structure became a private home for many years before it was incorporated into William & Mary\u2019s campus. The former schoolhouse eventually was moved from its original spot to make way for a dormitory. The original structure had 1.5 stories, with a small upstairs. It was expanded over the years to include two full stories, and was last used as an office for ROTC, the college program that prepares military officers. Historians believed they had identified the original Bray School building, but it wasn\u2019t confirmed until 2021, through the use of dendrochronology, a scientific method that examines tree rings in lumber to determine the wood\u2019s harvest date. \u201cThis is a remarkable story of survival,\u201d said Matthew Webster, Colonial Williamsburg\u2019s executive director of architectural preservation and research. \u201cAnd for us, it\u2019s so important to put it back (to its original state) and tell the full and true story.\u201d The Bray School was exceptional: Although Virginia waited until the 1800s to impose anti-literacy laws, white leaders across much of Colonial America forbid educating enslaved people, fearing literacy would encourage their liberty. South Carolina criminalized teaching slaves to write English in 1740. Inside the schoolhouse, the original post at the bottom of the walnut staircase still stands, its square top rounded and nicked from centuries of use, Webster said, adding that it\u2019s a \u201cvery powerful piece for a lot of people.\u201d For Tonia Merideth, the Bray School Lab\u2019s oral historian, the building stirred up many emotions upon her first visit. It was material proof against the narrative that her ancestors were illiterate and dumb. \u201cEverything that I learned about my ancestors was wrong,\u201d she said. \u201cThey could learn. They did learn. They were able.\u201d Merideth added: \u201cRegardless of the intentions of the school, the children were still taking that education and possibly serving it for their own good and aiding in their community.\u201d Merideth can trace her roots to the Armistead family, which enslaved people in the Williamsburg area and is known to have sent at least one child, named Locust, to the Bray School. But only three years of student lists have survived. The moving of the Bray School is part of Colonial Williamsburg\u2019s ongoing reckoning over its past storytelling of Black history and the nation\u2019s origin story. The museum was founded in 1926 but did not tell Black stories until 1979. In 2021, it uncovered the brick foundation of one of the nation\u2019s oldest Black churches. Last year, archeologists began to excavate graves at the site. The Bray School\u2019s new location is right next door. \u201cWe\u2019re going back and we\u2019re getting that school and we\u2019re getting that legacy,\u201d Merideth said. \u201cAnd we\u2019re bringing it back to the historic area.\u201d",

Being a sporting icon in Philly amidst passionate fans is quite an achievement for most. who headlined the \u201cProcess\u201d is one of those for the Philly faithful. Ever since being drafted in 2014, the Cameroonian big man has been the franchise centerpiece of the Sixers. Embiid and his swashbuckling style of play have thrilled the Sixer faithful consistently during his time at Philadelphia. While he has been regularly spotted at Eagles games and embracing the region\u2019s sports culture, Embiid might just have committed a cardinal Philly sin. The center was asked about who he would pick in the Super Bowl LVII showdown between the Eagles and the Chiefs. And while his allegiance might be true, Embiid\u2019s response belied the expectations of Philadelphians. Going against his Philly pride, the big man stated that he believes the Chiefs will win the Super Bowl. And his belief in the Chiefs arises from his appreciation for \u2018 abilities. While Embiid is a fan of the Eagles, he feels the Mahomes factor will take the game away from them. As reported by Sam DiGiovanni of Clutchpoints, Embiid was clear in making his statement. He did make it clear that he\u2019s rooting for the Eagles, though\u201d DiGiovanni. Embiid certainly is a fan of Mahomes. To compare him to the GOAT candidate of the NFL is certainly something. As much as Embiid wants his Eagles to win, he recognizes the Herculean task ahead of his team. Embiid\u2019s pick in favor of the Chiefs and Mahomes is a wildcard by some accounts. It seems the world isn\u2019t fully convinced of the abilities of Patrick Mahomes as much as Embiid is. The Philadelphia Eagles are favored to win by more than 1.5 points. A reasonable margin to describe the status of favorites going into the game. Either way, it would appear Embiid stands to win both ways. If the Eagles win, his team wins and if the Chiefs win, his sporting acumen wins.",

    "content": "An unidentified object was shot down over northern Canada on Saturday, marking the third time in a week that U.S. fighter jets have taken down objects in North American airspace. On Friday, an unidentified object was shot down in Alaska airspace by a U.S. F-22, and last weekend, a Chinese surveillance balloon was taken down by F-22s off the coast of South Carolina. There's no indication at this point that the unidentified objects have any connection to China's surveillance balloon but it seems that national security officials across the continent remain on edge. Airspace was briefly closed over Montana before being quickly reopened on Saturday evening after a radar anomaly prompted a jet to investigate before an all clear was given. The unidentified object that was shot down in Canadian airspace had been tracked since Friday evening, according to a statement from Pentagon spokesman Brig. Gen. Patrick Ryder. The object was detected by North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD), and two F-22 fighter jets from Joint Base Elemendorf-Richardson, Alaska, were sent up to monitor the object with the help of the Alaska Air National Guard. The object appears to be a \"cylindrical object\" smaller than the Chinese surveillance balloon that was shot down previously, Canadian Defense Minister Anita Anand said at a news conference on Saturday. \"Monitoring continued today as the object crossed into Canadian airspace, with Canadian CF-18 and CP-140 aircraft joining the formation to further assess the object,\" Ryder's statement said. U.S. President Joe Biden and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau both approved the shoot down on Saturday, according to a statement from the White House. \"President Biden authorized U.S. fighter aircraft assigned to NORAD to conduct the operation and a U.S. F-22 shot down the object in Canadian territory in close coordination with Canadian authorities,\" the White House statement said. \"The leaders discussed the importance of recovering the object in order to determine more details on its purpose or origin.\" The object was shot down with a AIM-9X missile from a U.S. F-22 -- the same missile and aircraft that shot down an unidentified object on Friday, and the Chinese surveillance balloon on Feb. 4. \"The object was flying at an altitude of approximately 40,000 feet, had unlawfully entered Canadian airspace and posed a reasonable threat to the safety of civilian flight. The object was shot down approximately 100 miles from the Canada-United States border over Canadian territory in central Yukon,\" she said. Ryder's statement said that while Canadian authorities conduct recovery operations, the FBI will be \"working closely with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.\" Saturday's take down of an unidentified object is the third such incident in one week. On Friday, an unidentified object was shot down by a U.S. F-22 over Alaskan airspace after it had been monitored by the U.S. since Thursday evening. Pilots gave different accounts of what they observed after coming near the object, a source briefed on the intelligence told CNN; some pilots said it \"interfered with their sensors,\" but other pilots said they didn't experience that. The object was flying at 40,000 feet, which made it a risk to civilian traffic. That set it apart from the Chinese surveillance balloon, which was traveling \"well above commercial air traffic,\" Ryder said at the time. The Chinese balloon was shot down off the coast of South Carolina last Saturday after traveling across the U.S. Biden administration officials said it posed little intelligence gathering and military risk. It did, however, pose a risk to people and property on the ground if it were to be shot down, as officials said it was roughly 200 feet tall and the payload weighed more than a couple of thousand pounds. The U.S. military is still working to recover debris from the balloon on the ocean floor. Ryder said Friday that they have \"located a significant amount of debris so far that will prove helpful to our further understanding of this balloon and its surveillance capabilities.\"",

    "content": "Though most people still use either a single Wi-Fi router with their internet modem, or a gateway that combines both the modem and router functionality, a growing number of consumers are embracing the mesh network. As the name implies, a mesh network is simply a wireless network spread across a large area using multiple wireless access points (called \"nodes\"), ensuring that your home or office is blanketed by the Wi-Fi network . This type of connectivity is used to, for example, ensure that the basement and attic levels of a house also receive a strong Wi-Fi signal. Whether you live in a large house, or simply want the strongest signal possible in every room in your apartment, mesh networking is the way to go \u2014 assuming you don't mind spending a bit to get all of the hardware you need. Depending on the mesh network system you choose, each node \u2014 a small physical device placed in different rooms \u2014 can be expensive at around $100 each. To avoid overspending on an unnecessary number of these devices, you should first figure out the square footage of your home. Evaluate the layout and determine exactly how many access points you need for a robust Wi-Fi experience, regardless of which room you're in.",

    "content": "In an emotional sit-down interview, Buffalo Bills safety Damar Hamlin discussed his physical and emotional recovery after suffering cardiac arrest in the first quarter of the Jan. 2 NFL game against the Cincinnati Bengals. Speaking with Good Morning America \u2018s Michael Strahan , the 24-year-old professional football player opened up about the incident, which saw him hospitalized after collapsing on the field following a hit, something Hamlin said he was told \u201ccould have been the last of me.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m just thankful [God] gave me a second chance just to live normally and just come out almost without a scratch on me,\u201d Hamlin said. \u201cJust to be able to keep going.\u201d While Hamlin says he\u2019s physically doing great, he\u2019s still working through the emotional trauma of the experience. \u201cI\u2019m still trying to process all the emotions and the trauma that comes from dealing with a situation like that and not really having people around or no one in my immediate circle who\u2019s dealt with something like that.\u201d As for the details around what physically happened \u2014 including what may have caused the cardiac arrest \u2014 Hamlin said it\u2019s \u201csomething I want to stay away from.\u201d He did, however, say that he\u2019s \u201calways been a healthy, young, fit, energetic\u201d athlete and that he and his team are \u201cstill processing\u201d and \u201ctalking to my doctors just to see what everything was.\u201d When asked whether he remembered the moments right before his collapse, he declined to speak to it, citing it as \u201csomething I don\u2019t really want to get deep into.\u201d As for whether Hamlin has watched video of his medical emergency, the NFL player said he has once or twice while in the ICU. The experience left him with a \u201ccrazy feeling\u201d and it\u2019s something that he can\u2019t \u201cwatch too much.\u201d \u201c[It\u2019s] something I can\u2019t even describe yet; something I\u2019m still processing; something I\u2019m still trying to work through,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy\u2019d it happen to me?\u201d While Hamlin says he is still mentally processing what happened to him and awaiting answers from his medical team, he expressed his appreciation for Denny Kellington, the assistant athletic trainer for the Bills who performed CPR on the player immediately after he collapsed. \u201cI owe Denny my life,\u201d Hamlin told GMA . \u201cHe loves to say he was just doing his job, which is true, you know? And that night, he was literally the savior of my life.\u201d After collapsing on the Paycor Stadium field, Hamlin was given CPR and taken by ambulance to a Cincinnati hospital, where he was admitted to the intensive care unit before waking up and spending three days on a ventilator. He was eventually released from the hospital one week after he was admitted, his recovery previously described by his doctors as \u201cremarkable.\u201d As for his potential return to the field, Hamlin described it as \u201ca tough situation\u201d that he was told \u201cwas up to me.\u201d \u201cThey can\u2019t really tell,\u201d he said of his health team\u2019s prognosis. \u201cIt\u2019s a long road and they\u2019re just worried about trying to get me back to normal as much as they can.\u201d",

    "content": "Berlin\u2019s European Film Market hasn\u2019t even started yet, but the first big EFM deal has been announced. Lionsgate and Amazon have joined forces to buy up rights for most of the world for Guy Ritchie \u2019s upcoming World War II action movie, The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare . Lionsgate has secured U.S. distribution rights to The Ministry , with Amazon Prime Video taking rights in multiple international territories, including Europe, Central and South America, Europe and India. The film\u2019s ensemble cast includes Henry Cavill , Eiza Gonz\u00e1lez, Alan Ritchson, Henry Golding, Til Schweiger, Alex Pettyfer, Cary Elwes, Hero Fiennes Tiffin, Babs Olusanmokun and Henrique Zaga. An adaptation of Damien Lewis\u2019 non-fiction book: The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare: How Churchill\u2019s Secret Warriors Set Europe Ablaze and Gave Birth to Modern Black Ops the film charts the true story of how U.K. Prime Minister Winston Churchill and James Bond writer Ian Fleming set up a clandestine combat organization that used unconventional and \u201cungentlemanly\u201d techniques to fight the Nazis, helping give birth to modern Black Ops units. The project, which was originally set up at Paramount, is being pitched as the first in a possible franchise. Top Gun: Maverick producer Jerry Bruckheimer is producing the film alongside Chad Oman, Ritchie\u2019s producing partner Ivan Atkinson and John Friedberg for Black Bear International.

We wish to express our sincere condolences to the people of Turkey. We stand by them and are committed to supporting members of our production team and the wider community over the coming weeks and months.\u201d",

    "description": "The Flash movie is finally coming to theaters all over the world this summer. Here is everything you need to know about The post \u2018The Flash\u2019 Trailer Reveals the Return of Michael Keaton\u2019s Batman | release date | plot, cast, trailer first appeared on MarkMeets | Entertainment, Music, Movie, TV & London Film Premiere News.",
    "content": "To say that is one of the most eagerly-anticipated movies right now would be something of an understatement. Of course, none of us could wait that long so we were treated to a glimpse of a new trailer at the Super Bowl and what a trailer it was, not only confirming the epic return of the two Batmans (Batmen?), but seemingly referencing a third with an incredible shot of the Batcycle. Christian Bale, is that you? While lots is still being kept under wraps, we know that the Scarlet Speedster will attempt to change his past by going back in time to alter his mother\u2019s fate \u2013 and is thrown into the multiverse as a result. The new trailer also gave us a glimpse at Sasha Calle\u2019s Supergirl and the return of General Zod (Michael Shannon) and fans could not be more hyped. The superhero epic has been plagued by controversy and delays since it was first announced in 2014. However, DC boss James Gunn has still raised expectations for the movie in a big way, referring to it as \u201cprobably one of the greatest superhero movies ever made\u201d. The filmmaker, who\u2019s relaunching the DCU, also confirmed it \u201cresets the entire DC Universe\u201d. So no pressure! While we still have some time to wait before The Flash speeds into cinemas, read on for everything you need to know about this much-anticipated chapter in the DC Extended Universe. The Flash will come out in cinemas on 16th June 2023, a week earlier than its previously announced 23rd June 2023 release date. The release date has likely been pushed forward by a week to avoid Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, which finally announced that it will premiere on 30th June. The film was originally slated to premiere in cinemas in November 2022. The movie was then brought forward to as part of Warner Bros\u2019 response to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, before being delayed again by a year. After months of delays and pre-production, The Flash finally began filming on 26th April 2021. Fans have already had to wait a very long time to see a standalone film, with Miller having already signed on as long ago as 2014 \u2013 so by the time we see the movie, it\u2019ll be almost a decade since the star agreed to play the character. Talk about patience! Of course in that time the character has appeared in other DC films, but it can surely only be good news that he\u2019s finally getting his own movie. Confirmed to star in The Flash are: Ezra Miller will take on the lead role of Barry Allen/The Flash. Billy Crudup had to pull out of the role of Barry\u2019s father Henry due to scheduling conflicts and has been replaced by The Conjuring\u2019s Ron Livingston, who will be joined by Pan\u2019s Labyrinth actress Maribel Verd\u00fa as Barry\u2019s mum Nora. Kiersey Clemons has been confirmed to return as Barry\u2019s love interest Iris West. Clemons shot scenes for Justice League that were ultimately deleted from the theatrical cut, but were reinstated in the infamous Snyder Cut which has now been released. There is now a little bit more clarity surrounding those behind the camera. Andy Muschietti, who helmed both parts of the recent big screen adaptation of Stephen King\u2019s IT, will direct from a script by Christina Hodson (Bumblebee) \u2013 after a string of other names had previously been attached to the project. Back in August 2020 some very surprising news broke about some other stars who would be appearing in the film \u2013 with former Batmen Ben Affleck and Michael Keaton set to reprise their roles as the Caped Crusader. Muschietti described Affleck\u2019s role as \u201ca very substantial part of the emotional impact of the movie\u201d while speaking to Vanity Fair, adding. \u201cThe interaction and relationship between Barry and Affleck\u2019s Wayne will bring an emotional level that we haven\u2019t seen before. Affleck spoke to Variety about the film and said: \u201cIt was a really nice way to revisit that as the prior experience had been difficult. Meanwhile, Keaton will recreate his Batman from Tim Burton\u2019s 1989 movie and its 1992 sequel, with Muschietti describing it as a \u201csubstantial\u201d part \u2013 and one of a number of the alternate-dimension heroes who would feature as we\u2019ve seen before. [It was] weirdly and ironically easy. A little bit emotional. Just a rush of memories. Without giving anything away, which I can\u2019t, basically the first shot, not of the entire movie but let\u2019s say the introduction [of Batman], is so good that when we walked on and started talking about a couple of shots and the angles, I went \u2018whoa, this is big. This is great.\u2019 I don\u2019t even mean for me. Just the imagery, it\u2019s great. And reminiscent, to some degree, of Tim Burton.\u201dIt seems like The Flash will be stuffed full of superheroes \u2013 as well as the two Batmans, The Young and Reckless star Sasha Calle will make her debut as the DCEU\u2019s Supergirl. What\u2019s more, The Flash footage has teased the return of Michael Shannon. The actor was last seen as Zod in 2013\u2019s Man of Steel, but a trailer shown at CinemaCon 2022 reportedly teased his return in the DC multiverse movie. The multiverse angle has prompted rumours that several more alternate versions of DC superheroes could appear, however \u2013 from a different dimension Wonder Woman to Brandon Routh\u2019s Superman. Even Smallville\u2019s Tom Welling has admitted that he is open to appearing after he reprised his role as Clark Kent in the recent Crisis on Infinite Earths event. One person that will not be appearing, however, is Ray Fisher\u2019s Cyborg. He was originally set to feature in the film but has since been removed and he stated that \u201cdespite the misconception, Cyborg\u2019s involvement was much larger than a cameo\u201d. The film will follow events of the Flashpoint comic, which sees the creation of an alternate timeline due to the Flash attempting to travel back in time to save his mother. Miller has gone on record to say that \u201cour precious DC universe will inevitably be torn asunder to an endless, headache-inducing fabric of multiversality\u201d which certainly sounds, erm, intriguing. And we now know a little bit more about the multiverse that will reportedly be explored in the film, with director Andy Muschietti claiming that the movie is, \u201ca bit of a hinge in the sense that it presents a story that implies a unified universe where all the cinematic iterations that we\u2019ve seen before are valid. \u201cIt\u2019s inclusive in the sense that it is saying all that you\u2019ve seen exists, and everything that you see exists, in the same unified multiverse.\u201d Muschietti further added that the film will explore the relationship between The Flash and Batman, telling Vanity Fair, \u201cIt\u2019s Barry\u2019s movie, it\u2019s Barry\u2019s story, but their characters are more related than we think. \u201cThey both lost their mothers to murder, and that\u2019s one of the emotional vessels of the movie. That\u2019s where the Affleck Batman kicks in. I\u2019m glad to be collaborating with someone who has been on both sides of the camera, too. He understands.\u201d As for filming, the movie shot in multiple places but most interesting to us is that Gotham City scenes were filmed in Glasgow and Edinburgh. An epic trailer was released to time with the Super Bowl. Watch it Online or on our youtube channel MarkMeets.",

Then I pretty much blacked out for the rest of the performance.\u201d By by Kelsey Weekman BuzzFeed News Reporter Posted 3 minutes ago Twitter Facebook Link Gregory Shamus / Getty Images When Rihanna opened the Super Bowl LVII halftime show with \u201cBitch Better Have My Money,\u201d Katie Begley screamed. The 22-year-old from New Jersey predicted the bold opening number in a viral TikTok hours before the show. She was one of many users who shared predictions for the performance, but she actually got it right. @popstar.katie #duet with @popstar.katie #rihanna my whole eat dreams have come true #rihanna #superbowl #halftime \u266c original sound - K A T I E \u201cI\u2019m going to do not necessarily what she will do, but what I think she should do,\u201d Begley said in the video before performing her own rendition of the 2015 hit. Less than 24 hours later, the post had 4 million views. Commenters were just as shocked after Begley\u2019s prediction came true. They asked whether she was a time traveler and if she\u2019d bet money on it.

Begley told BuzzFeed News that as a huge Rihanna fan, she and her friends knew they\u2019d have to stay home to watch the halftime show performance. After five years of waiting for the singer to return to the stage, they didn\u2019t want any distractions. \u201cI needed a full screen,\u201d she said. \u201cI needed to move around.\u201d In her parents\u2019 family room, Begley\u2019s mom filmed her and her friends shouting and jumping around as Rihanna performed. \u201cI didn\u2019t think she was going to do it because it\u2019s not really PG,\u201d Begley told BuzzFeed News. \u201cI screamed.

Begley is an Eagles fan, but she said she woke up very happy this morning because Rihanna\u2019s brief return softened the blow of the Super Bowl loss. \u201cI only hope that being onstage for this inspires her to keep performing,\u201d Begley said. @popstar.katie I wish you could see my reaction when I heard the opening notes\u2026 #rihanna #superbowl #halftime #eagles #gobirds #philadelphia \u266c original sound - K A T I E Topics in this article Internet Culture Rihanna Kelsey Weekman BuzzFeed News Reporter Kelsey Weekman is a reporter for BuzzFeed News and is based in New York.

Sierra/Affinity are launching sales on the project and will be introducing it to buyers at the European Film Market in Berlin. St\u00e9phanie Chuat and V\u00e9ronique Reymond, the writer-director duo for whom the 2010 film was their directorial debut, will return to write and direct the remake, which is described as a \u201cstory life and hope but mainly of the heart.\u201d Gary Foster and Russ Krasnoff will produce via the Krasnoff/Foster Entertainment banner along with Vega Film, which produced the original. The Little Bedroom follows John, whose heart has weakened with age, but still beats with a stubborn independence.

But after a bad fall, John is finally forced to rely on Rose \u2013 whose broken heart needs care and healing just as much as his. As a friendship is forged, they help each other find the strength and peace to move on. \u201cI am very excited to be working with St\u00e9phanie and V\u00e9ronique on The Little Bedroom ,\u201d said Foster. \u201cThey are talented filmmakers who bring not only a bold cinematic vision to their films but a deep understanding of character. Working with world class actors: Morgan, Kate and Laurence, I am excited about the special film they will make.\u201d Chuat and Reymond\u2019s last film My Little Sister starred Nina Hoss ( T\u00e1r ) and premiered in competition at the 2020 Berlinale International Film Festival as well as Locarno in 2021.

What is spyware? Spyware is a type of software that is installed on a computer without the user\u2019s knowledge. It is designed to collect information about the user, such as their web browsing habits, and send this data back to the spyware\u2019s creator. Spyware can be difficult to remove once it has been installed, and it can risk the security of your personal information. The best way to avoid getting spyware on your computer is to be careful about what you download and install.

The spyware can be downloaded and installed on your computer just by visiting the site. Through email attachments: Spyware can be spread through email attachments, especially if the email is from an unknown sender. It\u2019s essential to be cautious when opening email attachments, even if they appear to come from someone you know. What to do if your machine already has spyware? If your machine already has spyware, there are a few things you can do to remove it and protect your machine in the future: Run a scan with a reputable anti-spyware program to remove the spyware from your machine.

Use an antivirus program and keep it up to date. This will help to detect and remove any spyware that does manage to get onto your machine. Use a firewall. This will help to block incoming connections from known malicious websites or IP addresses. Keep your operating system and software up to date. Hackers often exploit security vulnerabilities in outdated software to install spyware without the user\u2019s knowledge. You can close these potential security holes by keeping everything up to date. Be cautious about what you click on. Please do not click on links in emails or websites unless you are sure they are safe. Avoid clicking on pop-ups, as they may be trying to install spyware onto your machine. Keep your operating system and software up to date. One of the best methods to avoid getting spyware on a machine is to keep your operating system and software up to date. By keeping your software up to date, you will ensure that you have the latest security patches and features that can help protect your machine from spyware. Additionally, many software programs will automatically update themselves, so it is essential to check for updates regularly. Use a reputable antivirus program and malware scanner. The best method to avoid getting spyware on a machine is to use a reputable antivirus program and malware scanner. There are many free and paid options available. Some popular antivirus programs are Microsoft Security Essentials, Norton AntiVirus, and McAfee VirusScan. When choosing an antivirus program, it is essential to select one with good reviews and continually updated with the latest virus definitions. It is also essential to run regular scans of your computer with the chosen program. For added protection, installing a malware scanner such as Malwarebytes Anti-Malware is also advisable. Don\u2019t click on links in emails or open email attachments from unknown senders. When avoiding spyware, one of the best things you can do is be careful about what links you click on and email attachments you open. If you receive an email from an unknown sender, don\u2019t click on any links in the email or open any attachments. Just delete the email. Even if an email looks like it\u2019s from a trusted sender, if you\u2019re not expecting it or it looks suspicious, don\u2019t click on any links or open any attachments. If you do accidentally click on a link or open an attachment that contains spyware, don\u2019t panic. You can take a few steps to remove the spyware from your machine: Run a virus scan using your antivirus software. This will help to remove any malicious files that may have been installed on your machine. Run a malware scan using anti-malware software. This will help to remove any malicious software that may have been installed on your machine. Use a spyware removal tool to remove any remaining spyware from your machine. Be cautious when downloading files from the internet. Downloading files from the internet can be a great way to get new software, but it can also be a way for spies to install spyware on your machine. Here are a few things to keep in mind when downloading files: Only download files from sites that you trust. If you need clarification on a site, research it to ensure it\u2019s reputable. Be careful what you click on. Many sites will try to trick you into clicking on something that will download spyware onto your machine. Please pay attention to where you\u2019re clicking, and don\u2019t click on anything unless you\u2019re sure it\u2019s safe. Scan any downloaded files with antivirus software before opening them. This will help to ensure that any spyware that may have been installed is caught and removed before it can do any damage. Use a pop-up blocker. There are several ways to avoid getting spyware on your machine, but a pop-up blocker is one of the best. Pop-up blockers block unwanted pop-ups from appearing on your screen and can help prevent spyware from being installed on your machine. Several different pop-up blockers are available, and you can usually find them for free online. Once you have installed a pop-up blocker, it is essential to keep it up to date so that it can block the latest threats. Conclusion Keeping your computer safe from spyware is integral to keeping it secure. The best method to avoid getting spyware on a machine is to ensure you have the right antivirus software installed, keep all your software up-to-date and always be aware of suspicious emails or websites. Also, don\u2019t click on suspicious links and always remember not to share personal information online. By following these steps, you can rest assured that your computer will remain protected from malicious spyware.",

The second anniversary of the February 2021 coup d\u2019\u00e9tat in Myanmar is quickly approaching, and the abysmal state of armed conflict, insurgency, chaos, and anarchy has only been deteriorating. Despite the repeated calls by regional organizations like the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and by the United Nations to stop the violence, protect human rights, and respect the democratic process, the Burmese military junta has demonstrated no appetite for political concessions or negotiation with the resistance movement. With the uncertainty associated with the postponed general elections this year \u2014 which most speculate will be neither free nor fair nor legitimate \u2014 the civil war inside Myanmar is likely to only escalate in 2023. There is no end in sight. Yun Sun Nonresident Fellow - Global Economy and Development , Africa Growth Initiative Background Strictly speaking, the civil war in Myanmar has been ongoing since 1948. The fighting between the central government dominated by the Bamar majority and the ethnic armed organizations (EAOs) in seven ethnic states has never completely ceased since the country\u2019s independence decades before the 2021 coup. The country is no stranger to military coups either. The 1962 coup led by General Ne Win replaced the country\u2019s representative democracy with 26 years of military rule. And the landslide victory by Aung San Suu Kyi and her National League for Democracy (NLD) in the 1990 elections was also denied by the military, which held onto power for another 25 years until the NLD won again in the 2015 general elections. However, the modality of Burmese politics after the 2021 coup has been entirely different. Before the coup, the Burmese people had tasted democracy and freedom and had been exposed to the outside world and the free flow of ideas, information, people, and economic opportunities under a democratic government. They simply refuse to return to more decades of military rule, no matter that the Burmese military sees military rule as its natural prerogative and a normal state for the country. The opposition to the coup and the rejection of military rule have been the most powerful factors uniting the rest of the country and, crucially, driving divergent resistance forces together. No End in Sight for the Civil War It is these conditions that have allowed the National Unity Government (NUG) \u2014 the shadow civilian government formed by members of the parliament elected during the 2020 general elections \u2014 and its armed wing, the People\u2019s Defense Force (PDF), to thrive throughout the country. By 2022, the PDF was estimated to have expanded to more than 250 units with more than 65,000 troops . Even though different militias and units under the PDF framework do not share the same commander or commanding structure, they share the common aspiration of driving the military out of power. At the local level, especially in rural areas where the military junta\u2019s control is weak, the PDF enjoys substantial control of the territory and has been launching attacks against military barracks, police stations, and government administrative offices. Although the resistance is still fragmented, it somewhat improved in 2022. A sizeable portion of the PDF is either recognized by or under the command of the NUG. Many of the PDF units cooperate or coordinate their positions with the EAOs. The Kachin Independence Army (KIA), the leading ethnic armed organization in the Kachin state, and local PDFs have launched joint attacks against the military in Kachin State and Sagaing Region. The military government\u2019s existence as a shared target and common threat is uniting the NUG, PDF, and EAOs under the same objectives, though not in terms of operations or future post-conflict objectives. Myanmar\u2019s resistance forces still have a long way to go in terms of political negotiation and reconciliation among themselves. However, for the time being, fighting the Burmese military remains the highest priority for all players. Related Books Enduring and Emerging Issues in South Asian Security Edited by \u0160umit Ganguly and Dinshaw Mistry 2022 Militants, Criminals, and Warlords By Vanda Felbab-Brown , Harold Trinkunas , and Shadi Hamid 2017 Myanmar/Burma Edited by Lex Rieffel 2010 Despite the joint purpose among the resistance forces, it is unfortunate that the Burmese civil war is at a stalemate and will likely remain so for the foreseeable future. The power gap between the Burmese military and the resistance (the PDF and EAOs combined) remains significant, in terms of not only size but also weaponry and firepower. The resistance\u2019s lack of income \u2014 which is funded by donations \u2014 is particularly striking in comparison to the military\u2019s control over the state and its resources. After all, the Burmese military has the luxury of collecting tax and purchasing weapons from China and Russia , while the PDF and EAOs must rely on underground channels to acquire arms. In terms of territory, some estimate that the PDF and EAOs control 40 to 50% of the country\u2019s territory. Accurate assessment of the control of territory is extremely difficult given the highly volatile battlefield situation and the constant contest for territory between the military and the resistance. And most observers would agree that the territories under PDF control are in less-populated rural and jungle regions, while the Burmese military still firmly holds the population centers, including cities and urban areas. With the continuation of bloody violence during the civil war, the PDF and EAOs are gaining ground in the peripheries of the country, and it is unlikely that the Burmese military can eradicate these groups despite their repeated campaigns against the insurgency. Similarly, despite operations by the PDF and EAOs, a decisive victory to defeat the Burmese military is also improbable in the foreseeable future. Illegitimate and Destabilizing Elections in 2023? As stipulated by the 2008 constitution, Myanmar\u2019s state of emergency, which the military declared following the 2021 coup, can only be extended twice. This means that it would end by January 31, 2023, and the country\u2019s general election must be held within six months afterward, i.e., by August 1, 2023. Many people had expected that the military junta would have run out of extensions for the state of emergency, which it believes allowed it to form the State Administrative Council to govern the country. However, by the beginning of February, the military government extended the state of emergency for another six months, citing the \u201c unusual circumstances .\u201d The military\u2019s prior political and legal preparations had indicated that it was planning to hold the election sometime in 2023, but this announcement delays the election by another six months. The military cannot indefinitely postpone it. Regardless of when the election will be held, it will be highly controversial and destabilizing. As the resistance mobilizes to reject the election, speculation of attacks against polling stations and of efforts to deter people from voting has run rampant. The military junta may see a manipulated election as its ticket to some type of legitimacy. However, the contest for power will only manifest itself through more bloodshed. International Assistance to the Armed Resistance? The other potential game changer is international assistance. The 2023 U.S. National Defense Authorization Act has enabled direct engagement with the resistance movement, including providing non-lethal assistance. Although it falls short of the military assistance that the resistance forces have been requesting, calls from the resistance for such assistance have been growing in volume in Washington. The international community\u2019s attitude toward the resistance also holds great sway over the political situation on the ground. China\u2019s position, for example, could decisively influence the country\u2019s internal dynamics and trajectory. At a minimum, growing international concern, as demonstrated by the passage of U.N. Security Council Resolution 2669 in December 2022, puts greater pressure on the behavior of the Burmese military and the calculus of its foreign enablers, including China and Russia. More Western sanctions are unlikely to change the Burmese military\u2019s stance, but the tightening of positions by its foreign supporters will. If Beijing is significantly burdened and troubled by the deepening chaos and instability in Myanmar, it could more forcefully press the Burmese military toward negotiations and settlements. China has not done so in the past two years because COVID-19 had hindered mobility across the border and Chinese involvement. But that has changed now, as attested by the new Chinese special envoy\u2019s visit to Myanmar in late December 2022. There is no quick solution to Myanmar\u2019s seven-and-half-decade-long civil war. The power imbalance between the Burmese military and the resistance dictates that the struggle will be prolonged and is unlikely to render the result the West would like to see. In fact, many Burmese observers have privately assessed that the country has only \u201creturned to the pre-2010 path after a decade-long deviation.\u201d Thus, more internal instability and chaos, a bigger illicit economy, and deepening dependence on China and Russia are likely in Myanmar\u2019s future. There is no end to the country\u2019s troubles in sight.

Unfortunately, the update has caused problems for some users who have reported excessive battery drain on their devices after upgrading to the latest OS version, causing disappointment among affected individuals. watchOS 9.3 Update Apple Watch users finally get watchOS 9.3! This new software update brings a range of new and improved features to enhance the experience. \u201cwatchOS 9.3 includes new features, improvements and bug fixes, including new Unity Mosaic watch face to honor Black history and culture in celebration of Black History Month.\u201d Which devices get watchOS 9.3 update? To use watchOS 9, you will need an iPhone 8 or later with iOS 16 or later and one of the following Apple Watch models: Apple Watch Series 4 Apple Watch Series 5 Apple Watch SE Apple Watch Series 6 Apple Watch Series 7 Apple Watch Series 8 Apple Watch Ultra ALSO READ | The most suitable Apple Watch for kids watchOS 9.3 brings the issue besides Battery drain has been a recurring issue for smartwatch users and the latest watchOS 9.3 update has reportedly added to the problem. According to various reports, multiple users are experiencing significant battery drain on their smartwatches running the watchOS 9.3 update. The issue is causing frustration for many as the battery life of a smartwatch is one of its key selling points. One Apple Watch Ultra owner has claimed that before the update, their watch\u2019s battery would last more than three days even with heavy training exercises and sleep tracking usage. However, after installing the recent update, the battery life has significantly decreased to just 5% within a day. The owner further claims that the battery discharged by 3% while in idle or standby mode within just 1.5 hours. This has raised concerns among the users, who are now looking for solutions to resolve the battery drain issue. It\u2019s essential for the tech giant to address this issue and provide a fix as soon as possible to ensure customer satisfaction and maintain the reputation of their product. Until then, affected users can take measures to conserve their battery life, such as reducing background app refresh or lowering the screen brightness. We dug the web and found several claims across social media platforms \u2013 let\u2019s have a look at them. Battery Draining After WatchOS 9.3 Update I upgraded my Apple Watch Series 7 Cellular to watchOS 9.3 yesterday and noticed a lot worse battery life. The battery goes from 100% to 0% in just 6 hours and is connected to Wi-Fi rather than Cellular. I have already reset it to factory settings and performed a hard reset, and the issue persists. I hope Apple did not do this on purpose. Is anyone else noticing the same? Source Pre 9.3 my Ultra lived happily between 85% and 30%. This included 1 training set daily (with GPS) of between 60 and 90 minutes daily (I sometimes used headphones as well for a podcast). I wear the watch for sleep tracking as well. I was never worried and tested the watch for a 36 hour stretch (battery went down to 24% from around 80% also included the mentioned training and headphones test). I usually charge the watch when I have a shower to about 80-85%. I updated my watch to WatchOS 9.3 yesterday and, post update, the battery was at 78%. When I woke up this morning the watch was down to 5%. Fully recharged the watch to 100% and in 1.5 hours the watch dropped by 3%. this is while sitting at my desk, so no training session or headphone use. I bought the Ultra as the watch 7 and 8 battery life wasn't that great and now this. Source Despite the widespread battery drain issue on Apple Watches running the watchOS 9.3 update, many users have tried various methods to resolve the problem. Some have restarted their device, uninstalled a few apps, and even performed a factory reset on their watch, but to no avail. It appears that the battery drain issue persists even after these attempts to fix it. It\u2019s worth mentioning that this isn\u2019t the first time users have reported similar battery drain issues on their Apple Watch devices. After the watchOS 9.2 update, there were similar complaints from users. This suggests that the issue is not limited to the latest watchOS 9.3 update and that it may be a more systemic problem. ALSO READ | Apple\u2019s Airpods 4 rumors on features, wish list, price, and release in 2023! Unfortunately, Apple has yet to respond to the matter, and the battery drain issue remains unresolved for many users. We hope that Apple will acknowledge this problem and provide a fix soon to ensure the satisfaction of their customers and maintain the high standards of their products. How to fix the battery drain issue? If you\u2019re experiencing battery drain issues on your Apple Watch after the watchOS 9.3 update, don\u2019t worry \u2013 there are some potential workarounds that may help resolve the problem. Here\u2019s what you can try: Disable background apps: Make sure that background apps are not turned back on after the update. This can be done in the settings of your Apple Watch. Reboot and re-pair: Try rebooting your smartwatch and unpairing and re-pairing it with your iPhone. This can often help resolve any connection or software issues. Hard reset: If the previous steps don\u2019t help, try a hard reset on your Apple Watch. To do this, press and hold the side button and the digital crown until the Apple logo appears. After the reset, you will need to sign in to your watch again. We hope that one of these workarounds will help resolve your battery drain issue on your Apple Watch. If not, it\u2019s best to reach out to Apple Support for further assistance. In the meantime, keep an eye out for any official updates or fixes from Apple. If you\u2019re still experiencing battery drain issues on your Apple Watch after trying the workarounds we mentioned earlier, don\u2019t worry, there are a couple of other things you can try. Warranty: If your device is still covered by warranty, take it to the nearest authorized service center for a check-up. The professionals there may be able to help resolve the issue. Wait for the next update: If your device is out of warranty or if the workarounds didn\u2019t help, you may have to wait for the next update release. It\u2019s possible that the next update will include a fix for the battery drain issue. We\u2019ll keep our eyes peeled for any new developments regarding the battery drain issue caused by the watchOS 9.3 update on some Apple Watch units. As soon as we have any new information, we\u2019ll update this article. In the meantime, we hope the workarounds we mentioned earlier will help you resolve your battery drain issue.

    "content": "In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people . \u201cIt was like the apocalypse,\u201d Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters . The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week\u2019s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake , and had an unusually strong 7.5-magnitude aftershock, the reason this earthquake is so deadly has less to do with its power, and more to do with the preexisting circumstances of the affected communities and the lack of preparation for disaster. Freezing temperatures, road blockages, and social unrest are complicating humanitarian aid and recovery efforts, despite having more than 100,000 rescue personnel in Turkey and Syria. The earthquake damaged the only official humanitarian aid route in the northern parts of Syria, delaying delivery of aid to Syria . And in Turkey, a primary port in the southern part of the country suspended operations the day after the earthquake due to a quake-related fire. These obstructions lead to a bottleneck effect, where aid is unable to reach the people it was intended to help, said Margaret Traub, the head of global initiatives for International Medical Corps , which is currently assisting Syria and Turkey\u2019s disaster response. (The US has temporarily lifted its sanctions on Syria for 180 days to usher in aid.) In Turkey and Syria, the high concentration of old, inflexible, concrete buildings , the lack of construction oversight, the Syrian civil war , and an ongoing cholera outbreak have left the region vulnerable to devastation. \u201cYou already had areas where people were displaced and living in temporary shelters,\u201d said Traub. \u201cIn many ways, they\u2019re already really compromised going into the disaster, and now they\u2019re doubly displaced, and don\u2019t have their support mechanisms.\u201d This is what happens when you end up on the wrong side of the disaster divide, which explains how unequal losses experienced by certain communities and countries following a natural disaster are chiefly due to the discrepancy of wealth and resources, limiting the ability to invest in the very things \u2014 strong buildings, weather prediction, rapid humanitarian response \u2014 that would prevent deaths. There\u2019s a reason that 90 percent of disaster deaths between 1996 and 2015 occurred in low and middle-income nations, the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction found. It\u2019s not that rich countries are somehow exempt from extreme weather and geological events. It\u2019s that the lack of wealth, and everything it can buy, is what makes a quake or a hurricane or a tornado disastrous, more than the sheer strength of a storm or how high a quake scores on the Richter scale. Earthquakes are devastating \u2014 more so than other natural disasters \u2014 for those living on the other side of the divide. Wealthier nations that are able to upgrade older buildings, build new quake-resistant infrastructure, and invest in training and resources for their emergency response teams are likely to fare better during earthquakes than less wealthy countries. And communities \u2014 like the Syrian refugees hit by last week\u2019s quake \u2014 who were suffering prior to natural disasters lack the means of resilience, making it even more difficult for them to rebuild, let alone rebuild in a way that prepares them for the next disaster. \u201cWhen we talk about disaster response, we\u2019re often thinking about what happens right after a disaster,\u201d said Rebecca Rice, a professor at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, who researches emergency communications. \u201cBut it\u2019s not just how you respond right away. It\u2019s how you build a stronger community, where people have the social resources and the capital they need.\u201d How the disaster divide plays out Earthquakes are one of the deadliest types of natural disasters , accounting for the majority of natural disaster-caused deaths in the last two decades, and they are often followed by aftershocks , landslides , tsunamis , and fires . Millions of low-intensity quakes occur every year , but every one or two years around the world, a major quake with a magnitude of 8 or higher transpires. But while magnitude measures intensity, it isn\u2019t necessarily an indication of damage. In January 2010 one of the deadliest earthquakes in the 21st century shook Haiti, killed an estimated 220,000, injured 300,000, and left 1.5 million homeless. The quake was at a 7 magnitude. Only a month later, in February 2010, Chile was hit by an earthquake of even greater intensity, an 8.8 magnitude. Yet, Chile saw a much smaller death toll at 500 deaths and had relatively little structural damage . This is because Chile learned from its history, and as a relatively high-income country , had the means to address problems with its infrastructure and disaster response. Before a disaster occurs, stakeholders \u2014 nonprofits, local and national governments, and community members \u2014 should be brought together to make an emergency response plan, said Rice. In 1960, the Valdivia earthquake in Chile killed thousands, left 2 million people homeless, and caused $550 million in damages at the time \u2014 in today\u2019s dollars, that\u2019s $5.4 billion. This earthquake led to Chile developing stricter building codes and creating a coordinated national response for such emergencies, just as Rice suggests. In contrast, Haiti, the poorest country in Latin America and the Caribbean , suffers from the ongoing ramifications of colonialism and government corruption . Many of the resulting deaths from Haiti\u2019s 2010 earthquake were attributed to the catastrophic collapse of buildings which did not use reinforced concrete and were not designed for the lateral motion caused by earthquakes. This disparity in resources means nations like Chile can and do implement life-saving measures and materials while countries on the other side of the divide cannot. \u201cWe have the means to survive even large earthquakes,\u201d said Luigi Di Sarno, program director of sustainable civil and structural engineering at the University of Liverpool. \u201cThe matter is cost, affordability, and the willingness to implement things.\u201d Bridging the gap The disaster divide is not caused by a country\u2019s lack of engineers or policies, but by a lack of resources and motivation to implement those policies, said Di Sarno. Unfortunately, the quake in Turkey is evidence of how this lack of implementation can lead to catastrophe. In 2011, Turkey was shaken by a 7.2-magnitude quake that killed approximately 600 people. At the time, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan blamed poor construction for the loss of life. In the dozen years since that disaster, Turkey, like most countries, updated its seismic regulations and sought to improve its construction practices, but it faced logistical issues in doing so, Di Sarno said. Putting seismic-conscious regulations into practice is time-consuming, costly, and is often hindered by political corruption, Di Sarno added. \u201cIt is a trade-off between efficiency, availability, and also a willingness to accept the given cost of implementing them,\u201d he said. Despite Turkey\u2019s attempt at improved codes, the February 6 earthquake caused more than 6,000 buildings to collapse (About 4,000 buildings were seriously damaged or collapsed in the 2011 quake). Many experts believe the inadequate enforcement of building regulations played a significant role in the loss of life last week. \u201cBuilding codes in Turkey are very advanced,\u201d Di Sarno said. \u201cIt\u2019s the implementation, because of the economy and other things, the quality control is not fully ensured.\u201d A 7.8-magnitude earthquake, and its 7.5-magnitude aftershock, caused widespread building collapses and losses in southern Turkey and northern Syria. Aziz Karimov/Getty Images Earthquake preparedness measures, particularly up-to-code buildings, are not a one-off cost, Di Sarno said. Somewhere like Syria, which doesn\u2019t have the resources to build earthquake-resilient infrastructure once, won\u2019t be able to maintain that same infrastructure to the extent required. \u201cWe tend to believe that structures can stay forever, but even structures, like a car, are designed for a given time window,\u201d he said. This window, in most countries for an ordinary, residential building is 50 years , he added. \u201cBuildings are intended to survive even the abnormal actions \u2014 strong winds, earthquakes, floods \u2014 but this cannot happen forever,\u201d Di Sarno said. \u201cAnd what we are experiencing in a number of situations, including in Turkey, is that these buildings are aging. There is corrosion taking place, there is a degradation of the material.\u201d Wealth isn\u2019t a perfect shield, and sometimes quakes will be strong enough to circumvent even the best building codes, said Di Sarno. Even rich countries can suffer from high levels of economic loss and death when a quake is strong enough to cause a tsunami and disrupt critical facilities, such as in the 2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake that damaged Japan\u2019s Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. That disaster killed more than 18,000 people . The disaster divide can also be seen in the post-disaster response. Unlike Turkey, an upper-middle-income country , Syria is low-income and only recently started receiving international aid. Syria was already facing life-threatening conditions prior to the quake, with the UN Security Council stating in January that humanitarian needs in Syria reached their \u201chighest levels\u201d since the war began in 2011. Now, the dire circumstances of Syrians living in affected cities, like Aleppo, are only aggravated. The country will have to rebuild communities that were already falling apart, but doing so will be time-consuming and costly. \u201cAs for the case of Haiti, and now in Syria, we should also consider the presence of conflicts that increase the vulnerability of communities,\u201d Di Sarno said. \u201cWealth, political instability, and even harsh weather conditions affect the response to natural disasters. Resilience of local communities is severely affected by such additional threats.\u201d While well-intentioned, donations made in the immediate aftermath of disasters , such as this earthquake in Turkey and Syria, often fail to actually reach the people they are trying to help and can lead to wasted supplies. The real challenge when responding to disaster is finding support once immediate rescue efforts are completed, said Art delaCruz, the CEO of Team Rubicon , an international NGO that specializes in disaster response. \u201cThis response will go on for a long time, from a health perspective, and from an infrastructure perspective,\u201d said delaCruz. \u201cThe real danger here is the attention that this earthquake is getting now, or a tornado or a hurricane gets in the beginning, it fades very quickly. But the reality for the people that are on the ground continues.\u201d Will you support Vox\u2019s explanatory journalism?

    "content": "Packgod is a well-known name in the online community, and the recent major controversies he\u2019s been in have made fans wonder what happened to him and who he had a major beef with. People pay a lot of attention to fights and controversies, especially on online streaming platforms where creators accuse each other every day of stealing their work or doing something else. And this time, it was Packgod who had a big problem with one of his members, Leg. Well, this is where the article comes in. It will tell you the most important things that happened with the YouTuber and the streamer, as well as other information about Packgod, in a short, real, and accurate way. So, many Packgod fans are very interested in finding out what exactly happened with the Discord user. Let\u2019s look at this article, which will give you accurate and helpful information about every part of Packgod. Who is Packgod? . There are a lot of people who like him in the online community. He mostly roasts and makes fun of the most famous and well-known streamers and some of the most well-known people on the internet, like iShowSpeed and many others. But if you look back at his early career, he became very famous in 2022 after he started making videos in which he made diss tracks about popular streamers, which got a lot of fans\u2019 attention. First, he made a Discord server with a teammate or member named Leg. The server was called Void, and the Discord channel was called Void. He was also a co-admin on a YouTube channel, where he was mostly in charge of making and writing all the diss tracks that you can see. What happened to Packgod? Packgod is a well-known name in the content game, and the big scandal he got involved in 2022 made him even more popular and well-known on social media. Fans were sad, shocked, and felt a mix of emotions when they found out that he took over the channel he shared with another member, Leg, and Left Leg with nothing. This forced him to start over with a new Discord and YouTube channel, which got more likes and views in a shorter time with more support. While Leg and Packgod\u2019s former channel, which they both had, made the most diss tracks on well-known and popular streamers, which was at first a huge success for both of them, who knew it would end so quickly? When they posted a diss track about to their old , it got a lot of views and likes at first, which was what they wanted. But after all the drama with Packgod and the Leg, they went their separate ways and made their own content for the online community. They still had their fan bases and got likes and views for the content they made. Read More: What were Packgod and the Leg drama in 2022? In 2022, the drama between Packgod and the Leg was pretty intense. It all started when both creators started their channels, one on a Discord server and one on YouTube, where they mostly made diss tracks and other things related to it. But their problems started in 2022 when both of them introduced Discord packing, a way for people to fight with words or other things. But it got to the point where both Leg and Packgod started battling each other on their Discord server. On August 25, 2022, Packgod posted a video on their YouTube channel talking about the whole mess and their rivalries. So, Leg made the decision to kick Packgod off both the Discord server and the YouTube channel. During the whole drama, Packgod also said that he did 90% of the work while Leg did nothing. This drama was one of the most controversial in the online internet community in 2022.",

    "description": "The latest trend to hit the video-sharing site is a backlash against hauls and self-serving recommendations.",
    "content": "Though many people pretend to be above it, almost everyone who has ever used the internet has been influenced. TikTok , Instagram , Twitter , Twitch , Facebook , YouTube , and even websites like WIRED are filled with people telling you what to buy and why you should buy it now . In this oversaturated, ad-filled environment, it was inevitable that many people would get burned. The mousse would make their hair crunchy. The exciting new board game failed to be thrilling. The low-calorie snack would not\u2014could not\u2014taste exactly like your favorite bag of chips. Enter: de-influencing, a trend that has taken over TikTok since January. While influencers tell you why you need a product, de-influencers convince you of the opposite. \u201cDo not get the UGG Minis. Do not get the Dyson Airwrap. Do not get the Charlotte Tilbury Wand. Do not get the Stanley Cup. Do not get Colleen Hoover books. Do not get the AirPods Max,\u201d one creator said in a TikTok posted on January 23, to the tune of 57,000 likes. Cory Doctorow Ali M Latifi Lauren Goode \u201cThe same way there was backlash to photoshopped ads in magazines or the facetuning of selfies, people are burnt out,\u201d says Charlotte Palermino, the 35-year-old, Brooklyn-based CEO of skincare brand Dieux. Palermino is not surprised by the rise of de-influencing. \u201cConstantly being sold to is tiring. Being told everything is a miracle product is tiring.\u201d The brewing global recession has already affected the way advertisers approach influencer campaigns, as audiences are increasingly sensitive to showboating during a cost of living crisis. But de-influencing wasn\u2019t just triggered by the economy; it\u2019s a response to the way TikTok itself has changed. \u201cA few years ago TikTok felt so authentic because it wasn\u2019t serious,\u201d says Palermino. \u201cBrands weren\u2019t investing heavily into creators. It was a fun space where there wasn\u2019t pressure. Now the pressure has hit a boiling point.\u201d In November 2022, TikTok launched its TikTok Shop in the US, allowing users to make purchases directly on the app without being sent to a third-party retailer. Creators earn a commission by linking to Shop products in their videos. Naturally, \u201cmust-have\u201d products are now all over the app. Because influencers make their money by recommending purchases\u2014and because many enjoy elaborate #gifted PR packages filled to the brim with new products\u2014you might imagine they are fearful of the de-influencing trend. This isn\u2019t really the case. Palermino herself is a \u201cskinfluencer\u201d with over 267,000 followers on Instagram . \u201cI have a graveyard of products just staring at me in my bathroom and I reach for the same five every night,\u201d she says. Palermino is hopeful that de-influencing will stop people from tying their identity to what they buy, but like many online, she has already noticed something strange: \u201cDe-influencing is already morphing to influencing.\u201d Alyssa Kromelis is a 26-year-old marketing consultant from Dallas who created a popular de-influencing video in late January; she has now shot from 30,000 to 123,000 TikTok followers by making regular de-influencing clips. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of stuff that I\u2019ve purchased that is just total crap, so I thought I\u2019d share it,\u201d Kromelis says. \u201cI just wanted to help people save some money because I\u2019m a penny-pincher myself.\u201d In her first video, she rattled through expensive hair and face products that people should not buy\u2014yet she also recommended cheaper alternatives. Critics have noted that de-influencers target overconsumption by encouraging other, different kinds of consumption. \u201cI mean, I totally agree with that,\u201d Kromelis says, \u201cThat\u2019s the awkward paradox of the whole thing.\u201d While Kromelis appreciates that it may seem odd for de-influencers to recommend products, she wants to \u201cshare knowledge.\u201d Ironically, she says, her de-influencing videos have turned her from a \u201ccontent creator\u201d into an influencer\u2014while she earned her initial 30,000 TikTok followers from \u201crandom stuff that I would post about my life,\u201d she now regularly posts about products instead. \u201cI posted [my first de-influencing] video on a Wednesday, and by Monday morning, I had two packages at my door,\u201d Kromelis says. \u201cOne of them, I don\u2019t know how they found me.\u201d Kromelis is open to being paid to promote products, provided it\u2019s by \u201ca brand that I actually like and a product that I actually have used.\u201d It is possible that this entire trend is just a flash in the (eyeshadow) pan, but Kromelis believes that even when hashtag #deinfluencing dies, an appetite for authenticity and \u201chilarious\u201d brutal honesty will remain. Palermino posted on Instagram that the de-influencing trend feeds an appetite for negativity, and that she personally will not believe that de-influencing exists until it is nuanced\u2014not excessively positive or negative\u2014reviews that thrive. Tearing down influencers has long been a favorite pastime of the internet, and now netizens are tearing down individual products, too. Yet the beauty industry as a whole still stands. \u201cI don\u2019t think influencers will ever materially affect the beauty industry in terms of lessening consumerism,\u201d says Jessica DeFino, an anti-product beauty reporter who publishes a newsletter of beauty-critical content. \u201cI don\u2019t think this backlash is real at all.\u201d DeFino explains that there is nothing new about claiming beauty products don\u2019t work\u2014and in fact, such claims can help companies launch new and \u201cimproved\u201d products. \u201cThere are so many beauty products precisely because there are so many that \u2018don\u2019t work,\u2019\u201d DeFino says, \u201cThat\u2019s the thing about innovation and optimization: They require flawed and faulty products as a jumping-off point.\u201d For DeFino, the de-influencing trend is just that: a trend. \u201cThe beauty space has been engaged in this push-pull of more versus less for years now,\u201d she says, noting that 10-step skincare routines made way for \u201cskipcare\u201d and \u201cskinimalism.\u201d \u201cBoth instances were ultimately excuses to sell more products\u2014but different products, with more of a minimalist aesthetic,\u201d DeFino says. \u201cConsumers fall for it every time, and often feel self-righteous in doing so because they\u2019ve adopted the aesthetic of \u2018less,\u2019 if not the ideology.\u201d",

    "description": "A group of activist shareholders at the world's largest bitcoin investment trust claim they lost billions as the market tanked. Now they want to take control.",
    "content": "A group of activist shareholders in the world\u2019s largest bitcoin investment trust, GTBC, is plotting a coup. The unlikely patchwork of hedge funds, asset managers, and amateur investors is trying to unseat Grayscale Investments, the steward of the trust, whose management they claim has cost them billions of dollars. Since 2015, GBTC has been marketed as a simple way for regular people to invest in bitcoin without having to deal with an exchange, send crypto between wallets, or figure out how to store it safely. The value of GBTC shares is linked to the price of bitcoin: For every new share created, a fraction of a bitcoin is added to a pot, anchoring its value. In a series of adverts targeting the general public, some of which aired on major US TV networks, Grayscale described bitcoin as \u201cthe future\u201d and the ideal investment for retirees and other investors that \u201cdeserve the best.\u201d Now, GBTC shares are owned by hundreds of thousands of amateur investors. At the start of 2021, the shares, which had consistently traded at a higher price (sometimes even double) than the underlying bitcoin for years, slumped to 52 percent of the value of bitcoin in mid-December, meaning that for every $1 in bitcoin that shareholders own through the trust, they can only claim back $0.52 by selling their GBTC shares on the market. In aggregate, the discount created a multibillion-dollar hole in investors\u2019 pockets. \u201cInvestors are in limbo,\u201d says Christian Gal\u00edndez Beltr\u00e1n, a shareholder who claims to hold around $200,000 in bitcoin via the trust. \u201cI\u2019m really worried about not being able to redeem the totality of my money.\u201d Another investor, who asked not to be named for fear of repercussions from the brokerage at which he works, says he purchased roughly $30,000 in bitcoin through GBTC with the goal of hedging against inflation as he prepares for retirement. Although his financial situation has not been too badly damaged, he says the performance of the trust has \u201cill-affected\u201d his marriage; his wife, who \u201cfears the loss is permanent,\u201d has taken to calling him a \u201cbitcoin bozo.\u201d Thousands of GBTC shareholders like these have registered their support for the activist campaign, according to David Bailey, founder of BTC Inc and hedge fund UTXO Management, and leader of one strand of the movement. \u201cThat\u2019s what makes this a unique situation,\u201d says Bailey. \u201cThis product is sold on brokerage platforms in individual retirement accounts. This is your mom and dad thinking they are diversifying their portfolio.\u201d WIRED spoke to six GBTC shareholders, all of whom told similar stories. One person said they have the entirety of their savings tied up in GBTC, while another has taken on additional work to ensure he is able to sustain himself into retirement. Bailey claims that more than 50 institutions, some of which hold several hundred-million-dollar stakes in GBTC, are also involved in the rebellion to unseat Grayscale, representing a total of at least 20 percent of GBTC shares. He claims to be unable to provide proof, citing investor privacy and legal considerations, but supplied WIRED with web traffic and form submission data that suggests at least 2,000 investors have joined the campaign. Michael Sonnenshein, Grayscale CEO, says his firm is going nowhere. \u201cWe have absolutely no intention of stepping down from our role,\u201d says Sonnenshein. \u201cOur trust agreement explicitly states that we would have to voluntarily step down\u2014and our work is not done.\u201d But the activists are unperturbed. \u201cOur expectation is that, through the pure groundswell of people that want to get out of this thing, pressure is going to be put on,\u201d says Steven McClurg, chief investment officer at asset management firm Valkyrie, another ringleader of the campaign to overthrow Grayscale. \u201cThere are a lot of ways to affect change.\u201d He refused to elaborate on what he meant. McClurg describes this information as \u201csecret sauce.\u201d The group spearheaded by Bailey, called RedeemGBTC, wants Grayscale to reduce its 2 percent management fee, which it describes as \u201cpredatory,\u201d because it\u2019s calculated against the trust\u2019s bitcoin reserves, not the price of the severely discounted shares. The group also wants Grayscale to allow investors to exchange their shares directly for the underlying bitcoin\u2014in a process known as redemption\u2014as soon as possible. The nature of the trust\u2019s fee structure, lawyers representing Bailey\u2019s hedge fund have claimed , creates a \u201cperverse incentive\u201d for Grayscale to maximize the number of shares in the trust and restrict redemptions: They argue that the greater the number of shares in the trust, the larger the pot of bitcoin, which swells the revenue generated by management fees. McClurg describes this arrangement as a \u201chostage\u201d situation: Investors cannot exit without absorbing a large markdown on the price of bitcoin. However, the demands mapped out by Bailey and RedeemGBTC are an unhelpful oversimplification of the situation, suggests Grayscale, which claims to be doing everything in its power to do right by its investors. Namely, Grayscale has entered into a legal battle with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over its campaign to convert the trust into an exchange-traded fund, or ETF, which would let investors cash in their shares for the bitcoin in the pot. On June 29, 2022, the SEC announced it would not grant permission to convert the trust, citing fraud and market manipulation concerns. Grayscale has sued the SEC over the decision, which it calls \u201carbitrary and capricious.\u201d The two parties are scheduled to present their respective cases to a judge on March 7 and Grayscale expects a final decision to be reached by the autumn. The firm is bullish about the prospects of an ETF of this kind coming to market: \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of when, not if,\u201d says Sonnenshein. Although Grayscale could reduce its fees in the meantime, Sonnenshein argued in a recent interview with crypto journalist Laura Shin that the funds are best directed toward the ongoing legal battle with the SEC. Once the trust has been converted into an ETF, Grayscale promises to reduce its fees immediately. There has also been a \u201cmeaningful misunderstanding,\u201d Sonnenshein tells WIRED, among frustrated investors, who say that Grayscale could apply to the SEC for exemption from rules that prevent them from cashing out. The only way to apply for exemption, says Sonnenshein, is to pursue conversion to an ETF. Bailey\u2019s lawyers have also argued that Grayscale could allow investors to cash out without dealing with the SEC at all. But it\u2019s not that simple either, says Sonnenshein, because of a cease and desist letter issued by the SEC in 2016 that prevented the trust from issuing new shares and allowing shareholders to cash out simultaneously. The complexity of the securities laws that apply to trusts like GBTC creates opportunity for disagreements of this kind. \u201cIt\u2019s a spider\u2019s web,\u201d says Andrew Parish, a veteran crypto founder with close relationships to parties across the industry. \u201cIt\u2019s a mess that can hardly be understood by anyone other than accountants and lawyers.\u201d Contenders to take over from Grayscale have emerged from the ranks of the rebellion, including McClurg\u2019s Valkyrie. Bailey also has skin in the game: Not only does his hedge fund hold $2.5 million in GBTC shares, but his companies also have a combined $113,000 stake in Valkyrie. If Valkyrie were to succeed in its bid to take on the management of GBTC, it would absorb hundreds of millions of dollars in annual management fees, and Bailey would profit indirectly. But Bailey also says he holds a stake in DCG, Grayscale\u2019s parent company, that\u2019s greater in value than his Valkyrie position, so he also stands to lose if Grayscale is forced out. \u201cThis started because we were frustrated our fund had lost some money on its [GBTC] investment,\u201d says Bailey, \u201cBut once we started to receive comments from people about how they had been affected, it became something else. [We realized that] people need immediate relief.\u201d While Sonnenshein says Grayscale is always willing to hear investors out, he has reservations about the credibility of the RedeemGBTC campaign, which is run almost exclusively through Bailey\u2019s personal Twitter account and a simple website . \u201cWe always appreciate the opportunity to engage with any and all of our investors,\u201d says Sonnenshein. \u201c[But] it\u2019s tough to take seriously a Twitter account as a standalone, as compared to the nearly 1 million investor accounts we have across the US \u2026 Anyone could go to the website and say they have one share or 10 million shares\u2014and there\u2019s no verifying it.\u201d But RedeemGBTC is not the only group Grayscale has to contend with. In December, investment firm Fir Tree filed a lawsuit against Grayscale in an effort to force the firm to hand over information that might assist in an investigation into potential mismanagement and conflicts of interest. The lawsuit asserts that Grayscale\u2019s \u201cshareholder-unfriendly actions\u201d have harmed Fir Tree customers that hold GBTC shares, many of which are pension funds. This was followed in late January by a lawsuit filed by asset management firm Osprey Funds claiming Grayscale made \u201cfalse and misleading statements in its advertising and promotion\u201d that gave investors the impression that GBTC\u2019s conversion into an ETF was a \u201cforegone conclusion.\u201d Osprey also claims Grayscale\u2019s approach to advertising has made it impossible for competitors, including itself, to accrue meaningful market share. Like Valkyrie, Osprey has called on Grayscale to step down as sponsor and put itself forward as a replacement. In an open letter , Osprey CEO Greg King promised to cut the management fee by 75 percent, seek immediately to implement a redemption program, and collaborate with regulators instead of pursuing litigation. The Fir Tree and Osprey lawsuits were described by Jennifer Rosenthal, vice president of communications at Grayscale, as \u201cbaseless\u201d and \u201cfrivolous,\u201d respectively. \u201cWe remain steadfast in our belief that the conversion of GBTC to an ETF is the best long-term product structure for investors, and are 100 percent committed to that endeavor,\u201d she says. As it stands, the various parties are locked in a stalemate; Grayscale says it\u2019s not going anywhere and remains confident in the strength of its case against the SEC, while the activists are scratching their heads over how to remove the firm. In the meantime, the situation threatens to devolve into a mud-slinging contest, says Parish, as Grayscale tries to ride out this difficult period. It is not necessarily in Grayscale\u2019s interest for the conversion to an ETF to take place too quickly, he says, because the recent negative press around DCG and its subsidiaries (the lending unit of one subsidiary, Genesis, filed for bankruptcy in January) would likely cause investors to run for the exit at the earliest opportunity, taking millions of dollars in management fees with them. \u201cThe entirety of Grayscale\u2019s strategy here is to limit redemptions and then PR, PR, PR. And to fight legal battles on whatever field they have to fight,\u201d claims Parish. Sonnenshein contests the idea that activating redemptions would trigger a customer exodus, arguing that the \u201cregulated, battle-tested\u201d ETF structure will attract an even larger audience and an even greater amount of capital into bitcoin. He also says that converting the trust into an ETF has been the plan from the outset. \u201cThis is something that investors want and deserve,\u201d he says. If the courts were to rule against Grayscale and the company exhausts all remaining legal avenues of appeal, Sonnenshein says it would pursue a tender offer whereby a portion of shareholders are bought out of their shares at a price established with \u201cinvestor fairness\u201d in mind. But RedeemGBTC and Fir Tree do not share Grayscale\u2019s conviction in the strength of its case against the SEC, which is described by the pair as \u201cdoomed\u201d and \u201cwasteful,\u201d respectively, and point to the need for an urgent resolution to the situation. \u201cIf we thought Grayscale was going to be successful [in converting GBTC to an ETF], we wouldn\u2019t try to stop it. We just don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to happen\u2014so something has to be done,\u201d says Bailey. Three other shareholders say they believe it is unlikely for an ETF to be approved while Gary Gensler, sitting chairperson of the SEC, remains in charge. (Gensler\u2019s term is due to end in 2026.) The SEC declined to comment. \u201cThey [Grayscale] are going to dig their heels in and fight to the very end, but it\u2019s not going to bode well for them,\u201d says McClurg. \u201cFinancial services is a confidence game; when your clients lose faith, you\u2019ll never get them back. In the long run, I think they\u2019re done.\u201d",

    "content": "Whether you own/run a single commercial vehicle or a large fleet, you will have to apply for your US DOT number if you want to keep functioning in the transport and logistics sector in the USA. If you are wondering how to obtain a , you do not really have to do anything. There are countless DOT compliance facilitators and third-party administrators out there today that send out regular notifications and email correspondence to the transport industry players and every legal/commercial entity that is governed by the FMCSA and Department of Transportation. They work as reminders about your customary deadlines and compliance requirements that you have to fulfill with the federal motor carrier safety administration and the department of transportation to stay compliant throughout the year. If you have received a DOT compliance letter, you should take it as a reminder, a warning, or perhaps a message of caution that is directed to keep you aware of your regular filings and updates that you have to do with the federal motor carrier safety administration to remain compliant throughout the year. These letters don\u2019t just keep you updated but also educated you on the various developments that might be taking place in your industry and the new rules and regulations that the federal authorities and government issue periodically. Numerous send out these letters to companies working in the transport and logistics sector and in all those industries that are governed by the US department of transportation. But does it apply to your company? Should we follow these strict regulations? You must remember that DOT compliance is not mandatory or an absolute requirement for every commercial vehicle. If your commercial vehicle is registered with the department of transportation and has a US DOT number, you will be required to file your DOT compliance requirements regularly. The following should clarify this further: Fleet Compliance Fleet compliance means every rule and requirement that you have to fulfill when it comes to keeping your vehicles compliant with the laws and regulations laid down by the department of transportation. You will have to keep a checklist that will make it easier for you to follow these requirements to the last detail. A few general guidelines that you must be aware of include: There are a few requirements that all your commercial motor vehicle drivers also have to fulfill. It is important to keep a driver compliance checklist handy as well. Pay attention to the following guidelines: You must already be aware that the US department of transportation conducts audits related to DOT compliance. This is to ensure the safety of the company and everyone working in your workplace. It is to make sure that every driver and safety-sensitive position holder in your organization is meeting the requirements that have been mentioned above. If you are wondering the reason for such a mock audit, it can be absolutely anything. That\u2019s right. Anything can trigger this audit, whether it is a complaint made by a civilian or perhaps misconduct on the part of your driver. Remember that if you are selected for a DOT audit, you will have to prepare for it in advance. In short, you have to be compliant throughout the year because that is the only way to remain prepared for this audit. These DOT compliance audits happen unannounced. You might receive a letter today that the audit is going to take place the next day. This is a question that you need to ask yourself. If you are not able to ascertain your needs or are not aware of your status, you should connect with your third-party administrator. They are going to find out whether these requirements apply to you and your business or not. They would tell you whether there is any need to panic in the first place or not. If you qualify for DOT compliance, your third-party administrator is going to do the needful for you.",

    "description": "As the death toll approached 40,000, there was hope that more aid might finally reach survivors in war-torn Syria with border crossings being opened.",
    "content": "Hatay, southern Turkey \u2014 At night, when the temperature plunges below freezing, survivors of the monstrous earthquakes in Turkey and Syria burn wood scavenged from their own destroyed homes to keep warm. Families that were well-off and comfortable just over a week ago are now living in donated tents set up in a local park. Much of Antakya, in southeast Turkey, has been reduced to a place of misery and deep uncertainty. There, we met engineering student Abdul Rahman and his family. They were already refugees, forced to flee their hometown of Aleppo by the civil war in Syria . Now, they have been left homeless once again. Young girl saved from earthquake rubble week after disaster USAID Administrator Samantha Power on U.S. response to earthquakes 04:15 \"We will leave this city and start over again,\" said Rahman. \"We'll be fine. We're used to a hard life.\" Few in southern Turkey were prepared for the level of devastation delivered by the powerful earthquakes. Hundreds of makeshift camps have sprung up across the country. Aid is available, but conditions for the survivors get worse with every passing day. Trash has been piling up because there's no one to collect it. The odd rescue story was still emerging Tuesday, eight days after the killer quakes struck. An 18-year-old man was pulled from the twisted steel and concrete of his razed building in southern Turkey hours after two brothers were saved from their toppled apartment building. A Turkish rescue worker checks a collapsed building in Adiyaman, southern Turkey, February 11, 2023. Emrah Gurel/AP Increasingly, however, in both Turkey and Syria, efforts were turning from rescue to recovery. The Old City of Hatay, in southern Turkey, was once a thriving ancient quarter. It has been left unrecognizable and un-liveable. The Turkish government has promised to rebuild all the damaged and destroyed buildings across the country within a year, but few believe that will happen. Survivors have other, more pressing concerns, like burying the dead. A map shows the epicenter of two major earthquakes that struck southern Turkey on February 6, 2023, with a 7.8-magnitude temblor striking first in the early morning hours, very near the country's southern border with Syria, followed by another powerful quake about nine hours later. Getty/iStockphoto The overall death toll pinned on the earthquakes \u2014 a massive 7.8-magnitude temblor that struck early on the morning of February 6 and a second, 7.5 quake about nine hours later \u2014 had climbed to more than 37,300 people Tuesday, with more than 31,000 dead in Turkey alone. On Tuesday, residents of Hatay and other decimated towns and villages were focused on burying their loved ones and neighbors who didn't survive. Many were being placed in mass graves, hastily dug along the sides of highways or wherever else ground could be cleared. Makeshift gravesites stretch as far as the eye can see, and crews were busy digging more. The United Nations estimates the overall death toll could surpass 50,000 by the time recovery efforts have finished, but with the remains of so many people still buried under mountains of rubble, the true human cost of the disaster may never be clear. Syria to open border to aid Across the border in war-torn northern Syria, the misery has been compounded by slow-arriving international aid, but there was hope Tuesday morning that the pace might pick up with new routes into the country becoming available. Martin Griffiths, the U.N.'s emergency relief coordinator, visited Aleppo on Monday and acknowledged that rescue operations were \"coming to a close,\" with the focus turning to providing shelter and food for survivors and getting children back into schooling. White Helmets volunteer discusses recovery efforts in Syria 09:23 With rebel forces still in control of a significant swath of the country, only one border crossing from Turkey into Syria has been open for years. That's made it painstakingly slow for the U.N. and other agencies to get desperately-needed rescue and relief materials into the Syrian quake zone. Frustration and anger have been rising as people whose lives were already difficult have been left with nothing, in the freezing cold of winter, waiting over a week for help to arrive. On Monday, Syrian President Bashar Assad agreed to open two more crossings into northern Syria from Turkey, offering hope that more help could soon reach quake victims in the region. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres welcomed the decision by Assad, which he said would keep the crossings open for at least three months \"to allow for the timely delivery of humanitarian aid.\" \"Delivering food, health, nutrition, protection, shelter, winter supplies and other life-saving supplies to all the millions of people affected is of the utmost urgency,\" Guterres said in a statement.

    "description": "\"He does not believe that any of his warning shots could have possibly hit the person or caused the death,\" his lawyer said.",
    "content": "The lawyer for an Arizona rancher being held on $1 million bond says her client did not shoot and kill the Mexican man whose body was found on his property last month near the U.S.-Mexico border, but earlier that day fired warning shots at smugglers carrying AK-47 rifles and big backpacks on his land. A defense request made last week in Santa Cruz County Justice Court asks that the $1 million bond set in the first-degree murder case against George Alan Kelly be lowered or lifted. Kelly, 73, on Monday remained in custody at the Santa Cruz County Jail in the Jan. 30 killing. A preliminary hearing in the case is set for Monday, Feb. 20. Attorney Brenna Larkin, who was appointed by the court to represent Kelly, said in her request that her client \"admitted to firing warning shots at the smugglers earlier in the day, but denied firing any shot at any person. \"He does not believe that any of his warning shots could have possibly hit the person or caused the death,\" she continued. \"All the shooting that Mr. Kelly did on the date of the incident was in self-defense and justified.\" Kelly's ranch is located just outside Nogales, Arizona, city limits in the Kino Springs area. The victim, Gabriel Cuen-Butimea, lived just south of the border in Nogales, Mexico. U.S. court records show Cuen-Butimea was convicted of illegal entry and deported back to Mexico several times, most recently in 2016. The Mexican consulate in Nogales has not returned several calls seeking additional information about Cuen-Butimea. Kelly apparently drew on his borderlands ranching life in the self-published novel \"Far Beyond the Border Fence,\" which is described on Amazon.com as a \"contemporary novel which brings the Mexican Border/Drug conflict into the 21st century.\" Authored by a man with the same name, the 57-page novel focuses on George and his wife, Wanda. George Alan Kelly's wife is also named Wanda. \"Several times each week illegal immigrants would cross the VMR ranch,\" reads one part. \"They were led by armed human smugglers called Coyotes. George and his foreman had to patrol the ranch daily, armed with AK-47's.\" Neighbor Maria Castillo told CBS News affiliate KOLD that it wasn't uncommon to see people who have crossed the border in the area, but that it was never an issue. \"I drive through here every day,\" Castillo says. \"Late, early and never encountered anybody, I feel very safe living here in the area.\" The number of migrants apprehended by U.S. Border Patrol after illegally crossing the southern border dropped by roughly 40% in January, when the Biden administration announced a revamped strategy to discourage unlawful crossings, according to government data obtained by CBS News.

    "content": "Since mental health has become a topic of conversation at the dinner table, there has been a huge increase in the acceptance of past pain and traumas. When people talk about survivors, Eliza Bleu comes to mind. In today\u2019s world of individualism and hedonism, it has become common for people to act like animals.

There is also a downward risk for lithium carbonate and cobalt prices, Chen Xuesen also said, citing Goldman Sachs\u2019 recent update on battery metals, in which the investment bank\u2019s analysts said they were now bearish on these but bullish on basic metals such as copper. ADVERTISEMENT Bloomberg earlier this month reported that cobalt prices had shed more than 50 percent since May 2022 because of a drop in demand from the Chinese electronics sector. Lithium, while also down considerably, is still trading at a high price, limiting EV makers\u2019 opportunities to make their cars more affordable in order to attract more buyers. ADVERTISEMENT Since the start of 2021, lithium prices have soared tenfold to $80,000 per ton with the danger of shortages playing a big part in price formation. The news would be good for EV makers, which have been struggling to keep their cars relatively affordable while raw material prices soar, but bad news for miners. These are already reluctant to invest in new mine capacity, which threatens the future security of EV raw material supply and has become the cause of many apocalyptic shortage forecasts. The International Monetary Fund, for instance, forecast two years ago that demand for metals and minerals as part of the energy transition might exceed the current level of supply, noting that expanding mining operations would be a challenge.

    "description": "Lemon Pie's toes were cut off by gang members as practice for torturing kidnap victims.",
    "content": "An elderly dog whose front paws were cut off by Mexican drug cartel members is in the running for the title of pet of the year in the United States. Pay de Limon (Lemon Pie) is already a star among the roughly 500 residents of an animal shelter on the outskirts of Mexico City. He has made multiple international television appearances, including on The Oprah Winfrey Show. \"Pay de Limon\" (Lemon Pie), a dog that had its front paws cut off by the drug trafficking group Los Zetas, rests at \"Milagros Caninos\", the first sanctuary in Latin America for dogs in extreme situation, in Xohimilco neighborhood, Mexico City on February 7, 2023. ALFREDO ESTRELLA/AFP via Getty Images Pay de Limon's fame could now reach new heights thanks to a nomination for the prize of \"America's Favorite Pet\" -- the winner of which appears in Dogster Magazine and receives $5,000. The award would be another remarkable chapter in the life of a dog whose toes were cut off by gang members as practice for torturing kidnap victims. \"Milagros Caninos received a call 14 years ago saying that a dog's front paws had been cut off and thrown in the trash,\" said Patricia Ruiz, founder of the Milagros Caninos (Canine Miracles) shelter. Pay de Limon was rescued and now walks and runs with prostheses from the United States. He is currently first in the dog category of \"America's Favorite Pet\" based on votes received from the public so far, according to organizers. \"His life is an example of courage,\" according to a short biography on the competition website that describes him as a \"hero.\" \"The case of Pay de Limon has moved Mexicans, perhaps because it is a simple, brutal and moving proof of the cruelty of the drug cartels,\" it adds. Initially, taking care of Pay de Limon came with some risks, according to the shelter. \"While at Milagros Caninos we had him hidden for several months, for fear of reprisals, until we decided that it was time for him to lead a normal life like the others,\" the shelter said. Ruiz created the shelter after the death of her own dog, Salchicha, who died of suffocation. \"From that moment, I said to myself: I will help all the dogs who are suffering,\" she said. \"Milagros Caninos only takes in dogs in extreme situations. Dogs with cancer, without legs, blind, deaf, burnt, tortured, paralyzed, raped, drugged, beaten, mutilated,\" she said. Fresa Milagros Caninos The other residents include Fresa (Strawberry), who underwent reconstructive surgery after her face was bashed in when she tried to steal meat from a butcher. \"Now she is very happy,\" according to the dog's bio, which adds that Fresa \"is not spiteful\" despite her horrific past. Chocolata also lost both her front paws and has prostheses after being tied up and dragged behind a truck. She was brought to the shelter by the police on the verge of death and needed amputation. \"Little by little, she is learning to walk,\" according to the dog's bio. Milagros Caninos has taken in some 3,000 to 4,000 dogs over 18 years, according to Ruiz. The shelter uses four tons of dog food per month, at a cost of more than $30,000, for which it relies on donations. \"Milagros Caninos\" sanctuary owner Patricia Ruiz gives some attention to Belgian shepherd mix, Pay de Limon or Lemon Pie, on the grounds the sanctuary for abused and abandoned dogs, in Mexico City, Friday, Jan. 11, 2013.

    "content": "With the advancement of business technology, there are now many options for integrated information technology (IT) services that help businesses run more efficiently. Managed service providers (MSPs) are companies that help businesses to manage and administrate their IT needs. Services offered by MSPs include infrastructure installation and maintenance, cloud and cyber security, client user account management, and technical support. Some MSPs also provide supply chain management or call center operations as part of their overall services. If you are wondering whether outsourcing your IT needs is a good move, here are some ways that working with an MSP can benefit your business. Accurate Asset Inventory Few business owners can say that they have a clear idea of their entire IT asset inventory. This is because IT assets can range from large, visible servers to small, easily-missed items such as USB flash drives or SD cards. Services such as IT Glue Asset Management can be provided by an MSP to give you a clear idea of your IT inventory. This will allow you to make better decisions about your IT systems, help you eliminate unnecessary costs, and ensure that you are making the best use of your assets. In addition, a good inventory can help you undertake preventive maintenance measures to increase the life span of your assets and keep them running in optimal conditions. Minimize Downtime One hour of IT downtime can cost your business thousands of dollars and even more in lost reputation and customer trust. The ability to be proactive about maintenance rather than waiting for problems to arise will help your business avoid harmful and costly downtime. MSPs use remote monitoring and management to detect, diagnose, and fix problems before they become too serious. By avoiding downtime, you also improve your business\u2019s efficiency. MSPs can also help your business put in safeguards to improve security and prevent data loss or theft. In the event of a security breach, an MSP can also to get you back online quickly, recover your data, and minimize the impact on your business operations. Lower Costs You may find that it is much more expensive than you expect when you manage all aspects of your IT infrastructure on your own. From hiring an internal team of IT engineers to enlisting multiple separate service providers for various functions, the cost of running your IT systems as individual components can add up significantly. In contrast, an MSP offers a single source of expertise to handle all of your hardware, software, maintenance, and management needs. This helps to reduce overheads and saves you money in the long run. Having a single point of contact also saves you from having to spend valuable time managing relationships with contractors for each component of your system. Security & Compliance Every company is subject to laws and regulations that govern how they should manage and protect data. An MSP can advise you on the latest standards and requirements and help you to tailor your security needs to meet the unique requirements of your industry. In addition, they can generate reports to demonstrate that your company complies with the applicable laws. Aside from facilitating compliance, an MSP can perform audits on your security systems and advise on any improvements or upgrades. This keeps your systems up to date and secure. With cybersecurity technology evolving rapidly, choosing an MSP can be the key to protecting your business from the next cyberattack. Higher Scalability If all goes to plan, your business will grow over time. To make the most of this scenario, you must ensure that your IT infrastructure is ready to handle additional staff, equipment, and traffic at the drop of a hat. This can be difficult for SMEs who are limited by space, knowledge, and budget constraints. A robust MSP has access to a large pool of tools and resources to meet the demands of a growing business, allowing you to scale up as quickly as you require without compromising the quality of your service. At the same time, should you need less capacity than before, a good MSP will be able to work with you to reduce costs and avoid spending money on services you do not need. 24/7 Technical Support The reliability and responsiveness of IT services are of paramount importance to businesses of all sizes. The hours of operation and the kind of support available should be factored into your overall assessment of an MSP. Most MSPs offer 24/7 technical support to clients, which is particularly important for businesses that work with global clients or those with busy schedules. This allows your company and its customers to get the support they need any time of the day and avoid any disruption to your operations. With most cyberattacks planned for late nights or weekends , having a reliable and trusted provider taking care of your systems around the clock can make a huge difference in reducing your downtime risk. Enlisting the services of a managed service provider is a great way to reduce IT-related costs and improve efficiency for companies of all sizes. It opens the door to expertise and premier technologies that help your company stay competitive and grow. Whether you are setting up a new business or expanding a current one, choosing the right MSP can ensure the success of your operations. Photo by ThisIsEngineering: Women using laptop",

Central Regional High School officials faced the public at a contentious school board meeting. What is clear is the community is scarred by the tragedy.

    "description": "In a ruling Thursday, the Arizona Court of Appeals denied her request to throw out election results in the state's most populous county and hold the election again.",
    "content": "Video above: GOP's Kari Lake slams AZ polling issues An Arizona appeals court has rejected Republican Kari Lake's challenge of her defeat in the Arizona governor's race to Democrat Katie Hobbs, denying her request to throw out election results in the state's most populous county and hold the election again. In a ruling on Thursday, the Arizona Court of Appeals wrote Lake, who claimed problems with ballot printers at some polling places on Election Day were the result of intentional misconduct, presented no evidence that voters whose ballots were unreadable by tabulators at polling places were not able to vote. The court said that even a witness called by Lake to testify had confirmed that ballots that couldn't initially be read at polling places could still ultimately have their vote counted. And while a pollster who testified on behalf of Lake claimed the polling place problems had disenfranchised enough voters to change the outcome in Lake's favor, the court said his conclusion were baseless. The appeals court wrote Lake's appeal failed because the evidence supports the conclusion that \"voters were able to cast their ballots, that votes were counted correctly, and that no other basis justifies setting aside the election results.\" Shortly after the ruling, Lake tweeted: \"I told you we would take this case all the way to the Arizona Supreme Court, and that's exactly what we are going to do. Buckle up, America!\" Lake, who lost to Hobbs by just over 17,000 votes, was among the most vocal 2022 Republicans promoting former President Donald Trump's election lies, which she made the centerpiece of her campaign. While most of the other election deniers around the country conceded after losing their races in November, Lake did not. Lawyers for Lake focused on problems with ballot printers at some polling places in Maricopa County, home to more than 60% of the state's voters. The defective printers produced ballots that were too light to be read by the on-site tabulators at polling places. Lines backed up in some areas amid the confusion. County officials say everyone had a chance to vote and all ballots were counted since ballots affected by the printers were taken to more sophisticated counters at the elections department headquarters. Lake's attorneys also claim the chain of custody for ballots was broken at an off-site facility, where a contractor scans mail ballots to prepare them for processing. They claim workers at the facility put their own mail ballots into the pile, rather than returning them through normal channels, and also that paperwork documenting the transfer of ballots was missing. The county disputes the claim. Hobbs' attorneys said Lake was trying to sow distrust in Arizona's election results and offered no proof to back up her allegations of election misconduct. Lake faced extremely long odds in her challenge, needing to prove not only that misconduct occurred, but also that it was intended to deny her victory and did in fact result in the wrong woman being declared the winner. In her appeal, her lawyers argued a trial court judge applied the wrong standard of proof in deciding the case. Hobbs took office as governor on Jan. 2.",

    "content": "Here's a roundup of recent incidents and announcements from Ventura County and regional agencies: SANTA BARBARA \u2014 Authorities said three new suspects, all juveniles, were arrested Thursday in connection with December's fatal shooting of a bystander from Camarillo at Stearns Wharf in Santa Barbara. The Santa Barbara Police Department's latest update now counts Ventura County residents among the suspects. Previously, four men, all in their early 20s, were arrested in January in the Santa Barbara area along with a teen. Thursday's arrests involved search and arrest warrants served at multiple locations in Ventura and Los Angeles counties, Santa Barbara police said. Several other agencies assisted. Two of the juveniles were arrested on suspicion of murder; the third on suspicion of accessory to murder and firearms possession. The age, gender and home cities of the three youths arrested Thursday were not immediately released. A firearm was recovered during Thursday's operation but police don't yet know if it was the gun used in the shooting. The incident took place around 8:40 p.m. on Dec. 9 when the victim, Camarillo resident Robert Gutierrez, 52, was walking with his wife along Stearns Wharf, a popular area where State Street converges with the beach at Cabrillo Boulevard. Gutierrez, described by police as an innocent bystander, was struck by one of the rounds fired during an altercation between two groups. He died Dec. 20 at a Santa Barbara hospital. Police say one of the groups included residents of the Santa Barbara area with ties to a street gang in that city. The opposing group was reportedly comprised of Ventura County residents with ties to Ventura County street gangs, the department said Thursday. Anyone with information about the homicide is asked to call the department's detective bureau at 805-897-2347. VENTURA COUNTY \u2014 Local authorities recently arrested two men, one a former Simi Valley resident, suspected of supplying significant amounts of drugs in Ventura and Los Angeles counties. The investigation ultimately led to seizure of more than 21 pounds of methamphetamine along with other drugs, cash and firearms. In October, narcotics detectives with the Ventura County Sheriff's Office identified one of the men as a possible drug supplier. The 53-year-old lived in Simi Valley at the time but later moved to Chatsworth. The second man, a 42-year-old resident of the Sylmar area in Los Angeles, was later identified as an alleged co-conspirator. In mid-December, detectives conducted warrant searches of the Chatsworth man's vehicle and home. The following month, they detained the Sylmar man as he reportedly delivered 8 pounds of meth in Simi Valley. A warrant search of the man's residence turned up several hundred counterfeit oxycodone pills knowns as M30s and a large amount of cash believed to have come from drug sales. In all, detectives confiscated more than 21 pounds of meth, about 4 ounces of fentanyl, 3 ounces of heroin and the counterfeit pills, which were believed to be fentanyl, a powerful synthetic opioid. In addition, cash and two handguns were also seized. Sheriff's officials said the 208 grams of opioids involved amounted to about 5,200 doses. The case was submitted to the U.S. Attorney's Office for filing consideration. THOUSAND OAKS \u2014 Authorities say they arrested a Thousand Oaks teen whose graffiti has marred city and private property since December. The 15-year-old male allegedly spray-painted walls of city buildings and private apartment complexes as well as tables, benches and walls at city parks, according to the Ventura County Sheriff's Office, which is contracted for police services in Thousand Oaks. The graffiti included both individual monikers and wording consistent with local gangs, said Deputy Weston Price. The teen's alleged activities were carried out over a two-month period and were readily visible along the city's main streets and thoroughfares, he said. The estimated property damage totaled more than $2,000, sheriff's officials said. Detectives working the case were ultimately able to identify the teen as the suspect. During a probation search of his home, they reportedly found additional evidence linking him to the graffiti vandalism. The youth was arrested on suspicion of graffiti vandalism for benefit of a street gang and was housed at county juvenile hall. Thousand Oaks residents can report graffiti to police at 805-654-9511. After police investigate, the markings can be removed. The city's graffiti removal hotline can be reached at 805-449-2488 or PublicWorksMSC@toaks.org. Items may be updated.",

    "description": "A longtime Google executive who played a key role in the company's creation is stepping down as YouTube's CEO.",
    "content": "Susan Wojcicki, a longtime Google executive who played a key role in the company's creation, is stepping down as YouTube's CEO after spending the past nine years running the video site that has reshaped entertainment, culture and politics. In an email to YouTube employees that was shared publicly Thursday, the 54-year-old Wojcicki said she is leaving to \"start a new chapter focused on my family, health, and personal projects I'm passionate about.\" She didn't elaborate on her plans. Neal Mohan, who has worked closely with Wojcicki for years, will replace her as YouTube's CEO. Although she became one of the most respected female executives in the male-dominated tech industry, Wojcicki will also be remembered as Google's first landlord. Shortly after Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin incorporated their search engine into a business in 1998, Wojcicki rented the garage of her Menlo Park, California, home to them for $1,700 a month. Page and Brin \u2014 both 25 at the time \u2014 continued to refine their search engine in Wojcicki's garage for five months before moving Google into a more formal office and later persuaded their former landlord to come work for their company. \"It would be one of the best decisions of my life,\" Wojcicki wrote in the announcement of her departure. In 2006, Google bought Wojcicki's home to serve as a monument to the roots of a company now valued at $1.2 trillion. During Wojcicki's career at Google, Brin became her brother-in-law when he married her sister, Anne, in 2007. Brin and Anne Wojcicki divorced in 2015. Wojcicki's departure comes at a time when YouTube is facing one of its most challenging periods since Google bought what was then a quirky video site facing widespread complaints about copyright infringement in 2006 for an announced price of $1.65 billion. The all-stock deal was valued at $1.76 billion by the time the transaction closed. Although Google was initially derided for paying so much for a video service whose future appeared to be in doubt, it turned out to be a bargain. Besides becoming a cultural phenomenon that attracts billions of viewers, YouTube also has become a financial success with ad revenue totaling $29 billion last year. That was up from annual ad revenue of $8 billion in 2017 when Google's corporate parent, Alphabet Inc., began to disclose YouTube's financial revenue. But YouTube's ad revenue during the final six months of last year dropped 5% from the previous year \u2014 the first extended downturn that the video service has shown since Alphabet peeled back its financial curtain. Analysts are worried the slump will continue this year, one of the reasons Alphabet's stock price has fallen 11% since it released its most recent quarterly report two weeks ago. Wojcicki is also leaving just days before the U.S. Supreme Court is scheduled to hear oral arguments in a case threatening the freewheeling style that has long been one of YouTube's biggest advantages. The case stems from the 2015 death of an American woman killed in Paris during an attack by Islamic State in an incident that spurred the victim's family to file a lawsuit alleging YouTube's algorithms aided the terror group's recruitment. If the court decides that tech companies can be held liable for material posted on their sites, experts say the effects could not only destroy YouTube but shake up the entire internet. That's because under the U.S. law, internet companies are generally exempt from liability for the material users post on their networks. Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act \u2014 itself part of a broader telecom law \u2014 provides a legal \"safe harbor\" for internet companies \u2014 a protection that YouTube co-founders Chad Hurley and Steve Chen seized upon as an opportunity to launch as video site to \"broadcast yourself.\" ___ AP Technology Writer Barbara Ortutay and AP Business Writer Michelle Chapman contributed to this story.",

    "description": "What \u2013 The legal case involving the co-founder and former CEO of FTX, Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF), is still ongoing. Why \u2013 In a new development, [...]",
    "content": "More twists are emerging from the ongoing FTX investigations and the bankruptcy proceedings. A new proposed class action that Silvergate and its CEO, Alan Lane assisted SBF and his two companies, FTX and Alameda Research, in a fraud. The lawsuit noted that the fraudulent scheme ran into billions of dollars. The lawsuit was filed on February 14 in the United State District Court of the Northern District of California. The plaintiff, Soham Bhatia, an FTX user based in San Francisco, initiated the case using 14 lawyers as representatives. Bhatia lost about $20,000 in crypto assets as the FTX crypto exchange went bankrupt in the last quarter of 2022. According to the lawsuit, the plaintiff accuses Silvergate Bank, its parent firm Silvergate Capital Corporation, and CEO Alan Lane of knowing the activities of SBF. He mentioned that the accused knows uses FTX\u2019s customers\u2019 funds. But they decided to hide the truth from their customers. Also, the lawsuit mentioned that Silvergate, Lane, and SBF have collaborated at all times. Finally, the lawsuit listed several allegations against the defendants. These include aiding, abetting, encouraging, omitting, assisting in wrongful acts, and other misconducts. The lawsuit claims some damages, restitution, and disgorgement of gains for the affected victims. It noted that the court would determine the amount for the claims during the trial. Currently, the district court is yet to certify the case. Certification is essential to authenticate the case as a class action. Besides the recent lawsuit against Silvergate, the bank has faced several other cases and probes on its ties with FTX and SBF. As per Bloomberg\u2019s report, US Senators pressed Silvergate Bank regarding its relationship with the FTX exchange. A bipartisan group of lawmakers sent a letter to the bank to ascertain its knowledge about the misuse of customers\u2019 funds by FTX. The group consists of Senator Elizabeth Warren from Democrat and Senators John Kennedy and Roger Marshall from the Republican party. This was after the lawmakers stated that the bank gave an incomplete and evasive response to an earlier inquiry. Also, Bloomberg the US Department of Justice investigation on the bank in early February. The probe relates to the bank\u2019s dealing with SBF\u2019s two companies, FTX and Alameda Research. The bank is in the California Southern District Court concerning its management of FTX\u2019s customers\u2019 funds. Joewy Gonzalez filed the case and accused Silvergate of assisting fraud by transferring FTX users\u2019 deposits into Alameda\u2019s accounts. Silvergate Bank is a financial infrastructure firm and a Federal Reserve member bank. Founded in 1988, the bank has advanced through the years and has taken a crypto-friendly stance recently. It managed customers\u2019 funds for the FTX crypto exchange before the platform went bankrupt.",

    "description": "After dropping just one set all season long, the St. Ignatius Falcons forced Westgate to a fifth and deciding set in Thursday night's championship final.",
    "content": "THUNDER BAY \u2013 Since 2010, only two schools have claimed the senior girls high school volleyball championship. Heading into Thursday night\u2019s final, the Westgate Tigers owned five of the titles, the St. Ignatius Falcons having won six. Two other seasons were cancelled. The Tigers hit the court in their home gym as the heavy favourite, having dropped just a single set in running the regular-season table, going 12-0 to earn the No. 1 playoff seed. The Falcons weren\u2019t too bad themselves, going 10-2 in 2023. Together they delivered one of the most competitive senior girls finals in recent memory, Westgate needing the full five sets to knock off the Falcons (25-20, 25-21, 23-25, 26-28, 15-8) to claim a third straight championship win. It didn\u2019t exactly play out as Sydney Deans thought it might, but the soon-to-retire senior said she and her teammates were ready to walk away just yet. \u201cWe\u2019ve been working for this for four years now. We walked in, most of us with no experience at all, and we\u2019re ending it like this. It was supposed to go three straight, but it felt nice to drag it out because it\u2019s the last game I\u2019ll play in my high school career,\u201d Deans said. Teammate Andi Rissanen said the key was not letting themselves get down after taking a two-set let, only to have the Falcons storm back to even the match and send it to a decisive fifth match. \u201cI was a little bit scared in the last set, but I knew we would pull through because we have so far,\u201d Rissanen said. \u201cI played last year and we lost our first set really bad and we came back. We always come back for the win. Hopefully we go to NWOSSA and then OFSSA hopefully. Rissanen said it was the mindset that made the difference down the stretch. \u201cWe were positive and just put up all that we had because we wanted to win it.\u201d The Falcons, who last won a senior championship in 2019, were never out of any set. They found themselves down nine in the first, but Maia Peterson served up five straight points to close the gap to 21-19 before the Tigers finished it off to go up 1-0. They were down seven at one point in the second, but battled back to take a 21-20 lead before the Falcons, led by Rissanen\u2019s serve, closed it out with five straight points. Westgate led most of the third, but too many unforced errors let St. Ignatius hang around, giving them eight of 10 points to go up 24-22, sealing it two serves later when the Tigers serve soared beyond the boundary. It was the opposite in the fourth, with the Falcons leading or tied most of the way, only to see the Tigers roar back to take a 24-23 lead and a chance to serve for the championship. But the Falcons saved the point, and another with the title on the line, outlasting their opponent 28-26 to force a decisive fifth set. The Tigers, who only dropped a single set all season, were dominant the rest of the way, jumping out in front 9-2 coasted to a 15-8 lead. Westgate coach Curtis Michaluk said it was a hard-fought win. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy bouncing back. We\u2019ve been kind of fortunate all year that we\u2019ve seemed to run the table. We had a fantastic season, and to be pushed in our home, like St. Ignatius did, they definitely surprised us and kudos to them \u2013 but I was very impressed with our girls in the fifth set and the way they held strong and battled through adversity,\u201d he said. The Tigers will travel to either Dryden or Fort Frances for the NWOSSA championship next Friday and Saturday. In senior boys\u2019 basketball, the St. Ignatius Falcons downed the Hammarskjold Vikings 83-35 to win their eighth straight title. Westgate won the junior boys\u2019 crown,",

    "content": "You\u2019ve probably seen them by now on your social media. They\u2019re hard to miss. Those big red boots are everywhere, and not just on celebrities. The thermoplastic polyurethane rubber-shelled boots are straight out of a world like Roger Rabbit\u2019s, where the lines between cartoons and humans are blurred. And according to the fashion brand that makes them, that\u2019s the point. \u201cCartoon boots for a cool 3D world,\u201d reads the Big Red Boot product description on MSCHF\u2019s website . \u201cCartoonishness is an abstraction that frees us from the constraints of reality. If you kick someone in these boots they go BOING!\u201d Here\u2019s what you need to know about this season\u2019s hottest \u2014 and maybe most debated? \u2014 fashion trend. Actor and musician Janelle Mon\u00e1e recently shot some hoops in her big red boots. Producer Diplo was trolled online for donning a pair at the New York Knicks game Monday night. TikTok and Instagram fashion influencers are wearing them. Rappers Rich the Kid and Lil\u2019 Wayne and basketball player Shai Gilgeous-Alexander \u2014 they\u2019re all rocking the buzzy boots too. Rapper Coi Leray danced around in the sought-after shoe when she performed \u201cPlayers\u201d at the Brooklyn Nets halftime show last week. Fellow musician Iggy Azalea tweeted, \u201cHappy big red boot day\u201d alongside a photo of herself in teeny red undies, which she paired with her massive red boots. WWE wrestler Seth \u201cFreakin\u201d Rollins kicked Austin Theory in the face with his big red boot during an episode of \u201cRaw\u201d this week. (Theory did not go BOING!) Music Music\u2019s biggest stars appeared at the Grammys in some of their boldest fashion statements. MSCHF, an art collective based in Brooklyn, is the company behind the boot. Former BuzzFeed employee Gabriel Whaley, who founded the collective in 2016, told Insider in 2020 that his company couldn\u2019t be defined and that he and his colleagues were \u201cfans of mischief.\u201d MSCHF was also responsible for the AI-generated feet photos and Lil Nas X\u2019s infamous \u201cSatan Shoes\u201d \u2014 a Nike Air Max 97 knockoff said to be made with a drop of human blood. After every pair of \u201cSatan Shoes\u201d sold out in less than a minute, Nike sued the company for trademark infringement. The big red boot stepped onto the scene earlier this month before they became available to the public. Celebrities and influencers started to appear in photos and videos wearing a pair so outrageous they couldn\u2019t be ignored. The boots went on sale for $350 on Thursday at 8 a.m. Pacific and sold out \u201cbasically instantly,\u201d MSCHF co-founder Daniel Greenberg told The Times via email. Although they are sold out through MSCHF\u2019s online store, they are still available through resale websites. Ebay has a few listings ranging from $675 to $1,224. Poshmark is also selling a pair for $1,200. Asked when the boots will be available through MSCHF again, Greenberg said, \u201cNot really sure what the future holds.\u201d Lifestyle Pantone\u2019s 2023 Color of the Year is Viva Magenta. Gifts in this \u201cfearless, brave\u201d color chosen for an unconventional time are ideal for trendspotters. Social media is giving the funky footwear mixed reviews. TikTok user @lilap posted a video of a man seemingly stuck being dragged across the floor while two women tried to remove the boots. \u201cDamn, that\u2019s dumb,\u201d the man in the video said. \u201cI would never get these. Yo, my foot is sweaty!\u201d @Power106LA tweeted a video of a man dressed like Cupid walking across the street in the big red boots with the caption, \u201cNAAAHHHHH what\u2019s going on with the MSCHF Big Red Boots?!\u201d And @Lexnthecityyy tweeted a video of TikTok fashion influencer Wisdom Kaye showing off his kicks with the caption, \u201cPeople can not sit here and tell me these big red boots are not cute and fun.\u201d",

    "content": "Tokens and coins are both able to be exchanged for one another on the many different markets that are a part of the BSC network. During the course of this education, you will get acquainted with the process that will make it possible for you to make the switch from ERC20 to BEP20 in the quickest and most efficient way possible. Follow the link that is given below the fold in order to find out the solution! Cross-chain product innovation has been a major contributor to the expansion of the DeFi sector. Due to their large user bases and high asset values, many consider Ethereum and BNB to be the best networks currently available. For this reason, the option to exchange token is greatly sought after. Using the Allbridge Core\u2019s decentralized cross-messaging protocols, an ERC20 token may be easily converted to a BEP20 token. Through native cross-chain swaps, this platform lets users trade Ethereum USDT or USDC for BNB Chain\u2019s native currency, BUSD. Learn how to convert TRC20 to ERC20 by following the link . Allbridge Core is a cross-chain trading platform that allows native stablecoin liquidity to be transferred from one blockchain to another. You may use this platform to transfer native stablecoins. The issue that needs to be answered is how exactly one may go from ERC20 to BEP20. Let\u2019s go even further into the inner workings of the platform and find out more about the particulars of the digital tokens that are used to conduct monetary transactions. It is necessary to convert one\u2019s tangible assets into digital tokens of an equal value in order to access the Ethereum network. After a user has begun a bridge transaction and chosen the appropriate tokens and chains, this step in the process has to be completed. Tokens are used in conjunction with the message protocol that was selected in order to convey the information. The sending of this message will immediately result in the formation of a legally enforceable agreement. The underlying blockchain was able to successfully allow the cross-chain transaction since the digital tokens\u2019 value had grown on the BNB Chain. Users are able to quickly and easily move their Bitcoin holdings to another chain by using cross-chain bridges. This enables users to begin participating in the recently implemented DeFi protocols. It is possible that maintaining the assets in a dispersed manner over many chains is a more safe option than placing everything on a single network. Allbridge Core, which also permits the trade of ERC20 and BEP20 tokens, lowers the barrier of entry into the new network, making it easier for new users to join. This is encouraging news about the potential size of the audience for the new network. Buying and selling stablecoins is made simple by Allbridge Core. The process of transferring tokens from ERC20 to BEP20 format is made very simple by Allbridge Core. There is a diverse selection of USD tokens, some of which are shown below. These USD tokens are the USDT, USDC, and BUSD. Allbridge Core provides compatibility for a wide variety of communications protocols, which helps it get closer toward its aim of decentralization. Increasing numbers of communication protocols allow for more integrations with both new EVM and established non-EVM supply chains.",

The measures, which still require the unanimous approval of all EU states, would target four more Russian banks, imports from Russia, including rubber, and exports to Russia including heavy vehicles, among others.

Spring had arrived. And so had someone else. The centre of the Ukrainian capital with its cobbled streets and ethereal gold-domed churches was mysteriously closed off. The main Zhytomyr Avenue \u2013 the route in from the west of the country \u2013 was shut too. Even the trains were late. Since Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion a year ago numerous foreign leaders have come to Kyiv to meet Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. But Monday\u2019s security measures were unprecedented. As videos circulated of a vast cavalcade of vehicles speeding through the centre of the city the rumours reached fever pitch. Could they be true? Sometime after breakfast it turned out they were \u2013 Joe Biden was in town, dropping by for an extraordinary visit. It wasn\u2019t immediately clear how the US president had reached Kyiv, arriving at 8am local time. It is a city without a functioning airport. A seasoned traveller on Amtrak, he appears to have got there by train. Since last autumn Russian warplanes have fired ballistic missiles at the capital, in an attempt to destroy its infrastructure and to immiserate its citizens. Nobody quite knows where the next bomb will fall, or when. A decision to go to Ukraine was made only on Friday, after a huddle of top officials in the Oval Office, the White House said. The visit was meticulously planned. The Biden administration informed Moscow about the trip a few hours after the president took off early on Sunday from Andrews air force base in Maryland. The Russians were briefed for \u201cdeconfliction reasons\u201d, officials in Washington said. Whatever the long route to Kyiv, the images on Monday morning told their own remarkable story.

In a series of posts on his Twitter feed, which is maintained by his associates as he serves an 11 1/2 prison sentence, Navalny said Russia had hit \u201crock bottom\u201d and that its troops had committed war crimes in Ukraine . \u201cTens of thousands of innocent Ukrainians have been murdered and pain and suffering have befallen millions more\u201d because of Putin\u2019s \u201cdesire to hold on to power at any cost\u201d, he said. He is desperately trying to make this a \"people's war,\" seeking to turn all Russian citizens into his accomplices, but his attempts are failing. There are almost no volunteers for this war, so Putin's army has to rely on convicts and forcibly mobilized people. \u2014 Alexey Navalny (@navalny) February 20, 2023 He wrote: .css-cumn2r{height:1em;width:1.5em;margin-right:3px;vertical-align:baseline;fill:#C70000;} The combination of aggressive warfare, corruption, inept generals, weak economy, and heroism and high motivation of the defending forces can only result in defeat.

He said he was required to \u201capologise and obey\u201d to someone \u201chigh up\u201d who he has a \u201cdifficult relationship with\u201d in order to secure ammunition for his fighters.

Russia\u2019s military production was now sufficient to supply the forces fighting at the front, he said, claiming the supply difficulties his fighters were experiencing were the result of conscious decisions. Prigozhin said the unspecified individuals he blamed for the shortage of ammunition were \u201ceating breakfast, lunch and dinner off golden plates\u201d and sending their relatives on holiday to Dubai, a popular destination for the Russian elite. .css-cumn2r{height:1em;width:1.5em;margin-right:3px;vertical-align:baseline;fill:#C70000;} Those who interfere with us trying to win this war are absolutely, directly working for the enemy. It is not possible to independently verify Prigozhin\u2019s claims. 1h ago 16.20 GMT The EU should use its full economic and legal force to punish those who enable the evasion of sanctions against Russia , Dutch foreign minister Wopke Hoekstra has said. Hoekstra, speaking at the College of Europe in Bruges, said the EU should use its collective economic strength and criminal justice systems to prevent the measures being circumvented. The EU should set up a \u201csanctions headquarters\u201d in Brussels where countries can pool their information and resources in the fight against such evasion, he said. .css-cumn2r{height:1em;width:1.5em;margin-right:3px;vertical-align:baseline;fill:#C70000;} This new HQ would establish a watch list of sectors and trade flows with a high circumvention risk. Companies will be obliged to include end-use clauses in their contracts, so that their products don\u2019t end up in the Russian war machine. 2h ago 16.00 GMT Summary of the day so far It\u2019s 6pm in Kyiv. Here\u2019s where we stand: Joe Biden has visited Kyiv, defying threats of Russian missile attacks, as Ukraine prepares to mark the sombre anniversary of last year\u2019s full-scale Russian invasion. The US president, closely surrounded by a large security detail, was escorted by his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, on a walkabout around central Kyiv as air sirens could be heard. 01:01 Biden and Zelenskiy walk in Kyiv as air raid sirens blare \u2013 video Biden announced a new package of additional US weapons supplies to Ukraine worth $500m (\u00a3415m) including artillery ammunition, anti-armour systems, and air surveillance radars. The timing of his visit to Kyiv \u2013 before a planned address by Vladimir Putin \u2013 was seen as a deliberate rebuke of the Russian president. Volodymyr Zelenskiy said he and Biden spoke about \u201clong-range weapons and the weapons that may still be supplied to Ukraine , even though it wasn\u2019t supplied before\u201d. But he did not detail any new commitments. Biden\u2019s visit to Kyiv came as EU foreign ministers met in Brussels. The 27-nation bloc\u2019s top diplomat, Josep Borrell, said the EU needs to ensure that Ukraine has enough ammunition to continue its fight against the Russian invasion. \u201cIt is the most urgent issue. If we fail on that, the result of the war is in danger. The Russian artillery shoots about 50,000 shots a day, and Ukraine needs to be at the same level of capacity. They have cannons but they lack ammunition.\u201d Fighting continues in the east of Ukraine and Russia regularly carries out missile attacks beyond the frontlines. Russian troops reportedly shelled the Kharkiv region three times on Monday morning: two people were injured, a woman may be under the rubble of a private residential building. Russia probably lacks the reserves to dramatically increase the scale or intensity of its offensive in Luhansk this winter, the Institute for the Study of War has said in its latest intelligence update. The US thinktank added that Russian forces likely secured small gains in the northern suburbs of Bakhmut and in its eastern outskirts. Russia will claim that Bakhmut has been captured to align with the anniversary, regardless of the reality on the ground , the UK Ministry of Defence has claimed. Russian forces are likely under increasing political pressure as the anniversary of the invasion draws near, the latest British intelligence report says. Japan will pledge a new \u00a34.6bn financial aid package for Ukraine, the prime minister, Fumio Kishida, has announced. Kishida, speaking at a global forum in Tokyo, also said he would mark the first anniversary of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine by hosting an online Group of Seven (G7) summit with President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Zelenskiy has warned that there will be a \u201cworld war\u201d if China decides to support Russia in its war on Ukraine. Speaking ahead of a visit by China\u2019s top diplomat, Wang Yi , to Moscow today, Zelenskiy said Kyiv would like Beijing \u201cto be on our side\u201d in an interview with Die Welt. \u201cIf China allies itself with Russia, there will be a world war, and I do think that China is aware of that,\u201d he said. The Kremlin has confirmed a visit by China\u2019s top diplomat, Wang Yi, to Moscow today. Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, Wang Wenbin, has told Washington to keep out of its relationship with Moscow, after the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, warned against Beijing providing material support to Moscow\u2019s invasion of its neighbour. The Kremlin has described Russia\u2019s relations with Moldova as \u201cvery tense\u201d and accused its leaders of pursuing an \u201canti-Russian\u201d agenda. Moldova\u2019s parliament last week approved the formation of a new pro-western government led by the new prime minister, Dorin Recean, who has vowed to pursue a pro-European path and also called for the demilitarisation of the breakaway region of Transnistria in the east of Moldova. The Moldovan president, Maia Sandu, has accused Moscow of plotting to topple the country\u2019s leadership, stop it joining the EU and use it in the war against Ukraine. Russia has been trying to gain intelligence to sabotage critical infrastructure in the Dutch part of the North Sea, according to the Dutch intelligence agency MIVD. A Russian ship was detected at an offshore windfarm in the North Sea as it tried to map out energy infrastructure, before being escorted by Dutch marine and coast guard ships before any sabotage effort could become successful, MIVD head, Gen Jan Swillens, said. Russia poses a clear military threat in Sweden\u2019s immediate area but its forces are largely tied up in the war in Ukraine, the Swedish Military Intelligence and Security Service (Must) has said. Lena Hallin, head of Must, also said she expected Russia to strengthen its military capability in Sweden\u2019s immediate area when it was possible, in response to Sweden and Finland applying for Nato membership. Good afternoon from London. I\u2019m L\u00e9onie Chao-Fong and I\u2019m here to bring you all the latest developments from the Russia-Ukraine war. Feel free to get in touch on Twitter or via email. 2h ago 15.52 GMT Joe Biden and Volodymyr Zelenskiy embraced after laying wreaths at a memorial wall for fallen soldiers, during the US president\u2019s visit to Ukraine earlier today. Biden got a brief first-hand taste of the terror that Ukrainians have lived with for close to a year as air raid sirens sounded over the city. 01:16 Biden and Zelenskiy hug in Kyiv after paying tribute to fallen soldiers \u2013 video 2h ago 15.36 GMT Russian state media is reporting that six Russian servicemen were killed in a bunker in the Kursk region, which borders Ukraine . Citing emergency services, state-owned Tass news agency writes that the fire occurred near the village of Ulanok, less than 10km (6 miles) from Ukraine\u2019s northeastern border. Seven servicemen were inside the bunker at the time of the incident, emergency services said. Six died while a seventh person was injured. 2h ago 15.28 GMT Russia says relations with Moldova \u2018very tense\u2019 The Kremlin has described Russia\u2019s relations with Moldova as \u201cvery tense\u201d and accused its leaders of pursuing an \u201canti-Russian\u201d agenda. Moldova\u2019s parliament last week approved the formation of a new pro-western government led by the new prime minister, Dorin Recean, after the previous administration resigned en masse amid a series of crises in the wake of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. The new administration has vowed to pursue a pro-European path and also called for the demilitarisation of Transnistria, a breakaway region in the east of Moldova where 1,500 Russian soldiers are stationed region. During his regular briefing with reporters, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Russia was acting \u201cresponsibly\u201d with regard to peacekeeping forces it has stationed in the breakaway region and warned Moldova against inflaming the situation further. He said: .css-cumn2r{height:1em;width:1.5em;margin-right:3px;vertical-align:baseline;fill:#C70000;} Our relations with Moldova are already very tense. The leadership always focuses on everything anti-Russian, they are slipping into anti-Russian hysteria. The Moldovan president, Maia Sandu, has accused Russia of trying to destabilise Moldova and has accused Moscow of plotting to topple the country\u2019s leadership, stop it joining the EU and use it in the war against Ukraine. Sandu\u2019s comments came after Moldova\u2019s intelligence service reported that it had identified \u201csubversive activities\u201d, after Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said Kyiv had intercepted a \u201cplan for the destruction of Moldova\u201d by Russian intelligence.

    "content": "With the release of Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania this past week, Phase 5 of the MCU has officially begun. After a mixed Phase 4 amounted to a shaky beginning to the Multiverse Saga, it felt as if there was some extra pressure on Quantumania to get Marvel Studios\u2019 next chapter started off properly. While the previous phase had some highlights, like Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings and WandaVision , far too many movies and TV shows failed to work as compelling stand-alone projects, and it wasn\u2019t clear where the collective narrative was heading, either. Quantumania makes a tremendous effort to steer that larger narrative on track, but as a result, it loses much of the quirky charm that defined the previous Ant-Man movies . There\u2019s a lot of TV out there. We want to help: Every week, we\u2019ll tell you the best and most urgent shows to stream so you can stay on top of the ever-expanding heap of Peak TV. Like almost every MCU release, Quantumania dominated the box office over its opening weekend, raking in an estimated $120 million four-day total . Yet it\u2019s also following what has become a trend of the Multiverse Saga, as it currently stands to be one of the worst-reviewed Marvel Studios entries among critics and fans alike. It\u2019s one of only two MCU movies to ever receive an undesirable \u201crotten\u201d score on Rotten Tomatoes , and it tied the lowest audience-driven MCU CinemaScore to date, joining the company of 2021\u2019s Eternals on both counts. While Quantumania is technically an Ant-Man and the Wasp movie, the driving forces behind its story are Jonathan Majors\u2019s Kang the Conqueror and major plot points from the first season of Loki . The film\u2019s characters and primary setting in the Quantum Realm are continuations of the previous Ant-Man films, but it sacrifices a more narrowed focus on the stories of Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) and Hope van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly) to further expand the MCU into the multiverse. Some of the franchise\u2019s soul feels lost in the process of better serving the MCU\u2019s greater agenda. We never even get a chance to hear Michael Pe\u00f1a\u2019s Luis tell a story about his experience during the Blip. Loki featured Majors\u2019s first MCU appearance; he played an alternate version\u2014or variant\u2014of Kang known as He Who Remains, and Quantumania now bridges that multiversal narrative to the main universe of the MCU. Above all else, the 31st movie in the MCU is positioned to set up the future of the Multiverse Saga as the studio ramps up to its two-part Avengers finale: The Kang Dynasty (2025) and Secret Wars (2026). Related \u201cIn very generalized terms, as you see in Quantumania , it\u2019s about setting up the big overarching thread that will go through the next phases,\u201d Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige recently told Entertainment Weekly . \u201cNot every film in the Infinity Saga focused on the Infinity Stones or Thanos, and it\u2019ll be the same across [Phase 5] and [Phase 6]. But we\u2019re gearing up. People will get a taste of this in a big way in Quantumania as we lead to Avengers: Secret Wars , which I\u2019m extremely excited for.\u201d As messy of a spectacle as Quantumania is, it\u2019s\u2014for better or worse\u2014a crucial table setter for the next few years of MCU content, which continues to come at a faster rate than ever . So let\u2019s get into where it\u2019s all heading. Despite all the hype around Kang, at the end of Quantumania , the villain is defeated by a bunch of supersized ants and a giant floating head with tiny legs. And then he\u2019s defeated again by Ant-Man and the Wasp. For a guy who\u2019s been billed as the next Thanos, it doesn\u2019t make for the most menacing debut, even if Majors\u2019s terrific (and very sinister) performance serves as the film\u2019s brightest spot by far. But there\u2019s something of a cardinal rule when it comes to characters dying in the MCU: If there isn\u2019t a body, they\u2019re probably not dead. (Or in the case of M.O.D.O.K., I guess, a massive head with tiny legs. And thankfully, we saw that the head died here, so we never have to see that monstrosity again.) Kang\u2019s demise in Quantumania is reminiscent of Red Skull\u2019s defeat at the end of Captain America: The First Avenger or, better yet, Darren Cross\u2019s death in Ant-Man . When Kang \u201cdies\u201d at the end of the movie, he appears to get sucked into his ship\u2019s multiversal energy core. After his exile to the Quantum Realm, he could just as easily be marooned in another realm in the multiverse. No matter where or when Kang went at the end of Quantumania , I don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s ever been more certain that a dying character isn\u2019t dead. Scott has a pretty heavy-handed interior monologue at the end of the film; the music intensifies, and he begins to wonder whether they actually defeated Kang or whether they\u2019ve unleashed something worse by not letting him escape the Quantum Realm. The post-credits scenes almost immediately confirm his suspicions. We\u2019ll get into the stingers in a moment, but it\u2019s also worth noting that the final tag of the film doesn\u2019t promote the return of the title heroes, as most MCU films do. There\u2019s no message that states that we\u2019ll see Ant-Man and the Wasp again\u2014it isn\u2019t exactly clear what the future holds for either character. (Based on how much the Wasp was sidelined in the film\u2014despite her name being in the title\u2014I\u2019m not sure we\u2019ll be seeing her again anytime soon.) Instead, we get a stinger for the film\u2019s villain: \u201cKang will return.\u201d And as the post-credits scenes tell us, that line should really be \u201c Kangs will return,\u201d since the \u201cExiled One\u201d is far from the last Kang variant we\u2019ll see moving forward. In Phase 4, we saw several stories touch on the concept of the multiverse in some way, whether that was through the introduction of new universes (like in Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings or Ms. Marvel ) or of variants and the multiverse itself (like in Spider-Man: No Way Home or Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness ). But Quantumania confirms that the story line that emerged in Loki \u2014regarding He Who Remains and the multiversal war that his variants started \u2014is what\u2019s driving the main narrative that the Multiverse Saga is building toward. Following Kang\u2019s \u201cdeath\u201d near the end of the movie, the first stinger gives us a chance to meet some of the other dangerous variants that He Who Remains warned Loki and Sylvie about in Loki . Specifically, we meet three of them\u2014all of whom are again played by Majors, who makes some choices in how he speaks as each variant. These three are Rama-Tut, a version of Kang who ruled as a pharaoh in ancient Egypt; (probably) Scarlet Centurion, who seems to have been remodeled in the MCU to become something of a cyborg; and Immortus, the oldest Kang of them all, who has quite the raspy voice to show for it. Immortus has summoned the entire Council of Kangs, and the trio are revealed to be only a small fraction of an army of Kang variants gathered in an arena. (The rest of the Kangs are all riled up and barking, for some reason. Majors is just having a good time out here.) Immortus has convened them all to discuss the death of the Conqueror, or the \u201cExiled One,\u201d as they refer to him; their plans for what to do next now that he\u2019s out of the picture; and the superheroes who are responsible for defeating him. \u201cNone of us killed him,\u201d Immortus says. \u201cThey did. They\u2019re beginning to touch the multiverse. If we let them, they will take everything we built. So let\u2019s stop wasting time.\u201d Before this very chaotic, goofy stinger even takes place, perhaps the most important explanation of where everything is headed comes from Kang himself (a.k.a. The Exiled One) when he explains his origins to Janet van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer) at his citadel. \u201cMy variants throughout the multiverse play with time like children,\u201d Kang says. \u201cBut I saw how it ends. I saw their chaos, spreading across realities. Universes colliding. Endless incursions. I saw the multiverse, and it was dying\u2014all because of them. So I took control.\u201d Between this scene and the first stinger, we get a more direct follow-up to Loki and the multiversal war that loomed over its first season. When Sylvie killed He Who Remains in the finale, she got rid of the one person who had been preventing the war from happening and let loose his more dangerous variants in the process. Now, there\u2019s a clearer sense of exactly who\u2019s involved in the multiversal conflict and what\u2019s at stake\u2014and the key word that points to where we\u2019re headed is \u201cincursions.\u201d The first time that we heard about incursions in the MCU was in 2022\u2019s Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness . Doctor Strange learns about them while stopping by another universe, and it\u2019s John Krasinski\u2019s Reed Richards who delivers the explanation: \u201cAn incursion occurs when the boundary between two universes erodes and they collide, destroying one or both entirely.\u201d That\u2019s more or less how Kang describes them in Quantumania as well, and an incursion is also what kicks off the 2015 comics event Secret Wars , which the upcoming Avengers film will pull from. In the comics, the incursion afforded a narrative pathway to merge popular characters from alternate universes, such as the Ultimate universe\u2019s Miles Morales, into the main Marvel universe. In the MCU, it could just as easily be used to introduce a group like the X-Men, bring in former actors and characters from other Marvel properties like Multiverse of Madness did, or even justify the resurrection of dead characters such as Iron Man. There are still almost two entire phases of films and TV series until the Multiverse Saga ends with Avengers: Secret Wars , which means we\u2019ll somehow receive more than 14 projects \u2014with much of Phase 6 yet to be announced\u2014in the interim. Quantumania provides the biggest hints yet about how we\u2019ll get there, but there will be many opportunities to learn more about the upcoming Avengers films over the next few years. The first time we\u2019re reintroduced to Cassie in Quantumania , she looks \u2026 different . Scott\u2019s daughter has grown up since the events of 2018\u2019s Ant-Man and the Wasp , especially with the time jump in Avengers: Endgame . But she also looks different because, well, she is an entirely different person; Marvel Studios recast the actress playing Cassie for the second time\u2014going from Abby Ryder Fortson ( Ant-Man and Ant-Man and the Wasp ) to Emma Fuhrmann ( Endgame ) to Kathryn Newton in Quantumania . Given that Fuhrmann appeared in only a minor part of Endgame , Marvel Studios took the opportunity to recast Cassie with a bigger name\u2014Newton previously starred in movies like Detective Pikachu , Blockers , and Freaky \u2014for her expanded role in the latest Ant-Man film. In Quantumania , Cassie gets a Pym Tech suit just like her father\u2019s, taking a pivotal step in becoming a superhero, Stature, in her own right. Cassie is the latest teenage superhero in a growing roster as Marvel continues to set up the inevitable formation of the Young Avengers. In Phase 4, we were introduced to Kate Bishop ( Hawkeye ), the Maximoff twins ( WandaVision ), Elijah Bradley ( The Falcon and the Winter Soldier ), Kid Loki ( Loki ), and America Chavez ( Multiverse of Madness ), all of whom are members of the self-assembled youth team of Avengers in the comics . Kamala Khan ( Ms. Marvel ) and Riri Williams ( Black Panther: Wakanda Forever ) are members of a different teenage superhero team, the Champions, but they could just as easily fit into the MCU\u2019s Young Avengers as well. (And while we\u2019re throwing out options here, Hulk\u2019s son from She-Hulk: Attorney at Law could join to show off that handsome head of hair , too.) Marvel has yet to announce a series or film centered on the Young Avengers, but as it continues to bring in new, younger versions of the old guard of Avengers\u2014including some who are even borrowing their names, like Bishop\u2019s Hawkeye\u2014it\u2019s only a matter of time. Given Kang\u2019s importance in the rest of the Multiverse Saga, it\u2019s even possible that a younger variant of his could be a part of the team as well. Just as he does in the comics, the Kang variant known as Iron Lad might even be the one to bring the Young Avengers together in the MCU. If there wasn\u2019t enough of Majors\u2019s Kang in Quantumania (and really, there wasn\u2019t), the film did its very best to let the audience know that we\u2019d be seeing plenty more of him moving forward. After an uncountable number of Kang variants appear in the first stinger, the second one focuses on only one: Victor Timely. And he\u2019s joined by Mobius (Owen Wilson) and the Asgardian God of Mischief himself, Loki (Tom Hiddleston), in what serves as our first extended look at the upcoming second season of Loki . The scene takes place in a theater in what appears to be the early 1900s, as Kang\u2014or some variant of his going by the name Victor Timely\u2014gives a presentation on his theory of time and relativity. Loki and Mobius are standing in the crowd, and as the curtain opens, Loki recognizes the man on-stage as He Who Remains. Mobius mockingly says to Loki that he \u201cmade him sound like this terrifying figure,\u201d which Loki only reaffirms. But more important than anything that Loki, Mobius, or even Timely says is the scene\u2019s setting and the introduction of Timely in particular. The character made his first comics appearance in Avengers Annual no. 21 (published in 1992) as a version of Kang who traveled back in time to 1901 and founded a town in Wisconsin that he named Timely. (Along with the obvious reference to time in everything Kang-related, Timely is a reference to Timely Comics, the name of the publishing company that would eventually become Marvel Comics .) After taking on the name Victor Timely and establishing Timely Industries, Kang essentially uses this company to build the time travel technology that would grow and advance over generations to eventually allow Kang to be the so-called Master of Time in the first place. In a self-fulfilling way, it becomes ground zero for Kang\u2019s empire. As I speculated at the end of the first season of Loki , Timely could also be the place where He Who Remains was leading Ravonna when we last saw her (she just so happens to be Kang\u2019s romantic partner in the comics). As always, it remains to be seen how closely Loki will follow the blueprint laid out by the comics, but we now know for sure that Timely will be a crucial setting in the second season, and that it won\u2019t be long before we see Kang again. Quantumania might not be the promising start to Phase 5 that fans were hoping for, but they can at least take solace in the fact that Majors played his part as best as he possibly could have. And starting with the second season of Loki later this year, there\u2019ll be plenty more opportunities for the actor to show off his limitless range as the story of Kang\u2014and his many variants\u2014continues.

Last week, Boice took the oath of office from Oregon Supreme Court Justice Roger DeHoog with his wife by his side. Boice was selected by county commissioners in Coos, Curry and Douglas counties to fill the seat vacated when David Brock Smith was appointed to the state Senate. Boice, who served six years as Curry County commissioners, then spoke to his new colleagues in the Oregon House of Representatives. \u201cI\u2019m here to be a servant leader and look forward to working with each and every one of you in the months and years ahead,\u201d Boice said. \u201cIn my Coos, Curry and Douglas district - it\u2019s a privilege to serve for the Timber Capital of the world, and where we can boast of the very best rivers, best fishing, best golfing and best cranberries all found anywhere. Please bring your families - come and visit us.\u201d Contributed photo Boice will be serving on the House committees of Natural Resources, Agriculture, Land Use, Water, Housing and Homelessness. Boice told his colleagues that public service is a family legacy he is proud to continue. \u201cI\u2019m simply, but greatly humbled by this tremendous honor and responsibility,\u201d he said. \u201cPublic service has deep roots in my family beginning with my grandfather Allen, who was historically the longest serving Curry County commissioner from 1930 to 1948. Also, my father Allen who was the famous sheriff from 1964-1975 and too, my first cousin Bev Clarno \u2013 who in1992 was chosen as the first ever Oregon woman representative to serve as speaker of the house.\u201d Members of the House Republican Caucus welcomed Boice, saying they were ready to get to work. \u201cI am excited to welcome State Representative Court Boice to the legislature and to the House Republican Caucus. I have full confidence that Representative Boice will serve his district well. I look forward to having his knowledge and experience in the building,\u201d said House Republican Leader Breese-Iverson (R-Prineville).",

    "content": "The popularity of Marvel characters can vary depending on various factors, such as their comic book history, their portrayal in other media like movies and TV shows, and their cultural relevance. Ever since the release of Iron Man in 2008, the MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe) has been the dominant force in modern pop culture. From its humble beginnings, the brand has grown from strength to strength, first with successful sequels like Iron Man 2, then with team up movies like The Avengers, then with crossover events such as Infinity War and Endgame. Marvel Studios has also widened its scope expanding into the universe with Guardians of the Galaxy, across time with Captain Marvel, into the Quantum Realm with Ant-Man, and now the multiverse with Loki, Spider-Man: No Way Home, and Doctor Strange 2. The MCU has also conquered the small screen too with the first canon TV series hitting Disney+ in 2021, so as the brand keeps on growing, we take a look at all the upcoming adventures planned in the Marvel realm. James Gunn returns to direct the third movie in the Guardians of the Galaxy franchise, which wrapped production in 2022. Once again the movie stars Chris Pratt as Peter Quill/Star-Lord, Zoe Saldana as Gamora, Dave Bautista as Drax, and Bradley Cooper as Rocket. It\u2019s rumoured to be the final outing for this incarnation of the team. Will Poulter will join the MCU as fan favourite character Adam Warlock, who has already been teased in the movies several times. Borat 2 star Maria Bakalova will play Cosmo the Space Dog. Yes, really. \u201cI couldn\u2019t be more honoured to join the MCU,\u201d she told Comic Con. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m doing something meaningful and hopeful and I hope you love Cosmo because she\u2019s gonna bring lots of laughs and love and a bit of strength.\u201d Here\u2019s the official synopsis: In Marvel Studios Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 our beloved band of misfits are looking a bit different these days. Peter Quill, still reeling from the loss of Gamora, must rally his team around him to defend the universe along with protecting one of their own. A mission that, if not completed successfully, could quite possibly lead to the end of the Guardians as we know them. Secret Invasion centres around Fury and Talos trying to stop the Skrulls, an alien race who have infiltrated the highest spheres of the Marvel Universe. The cast for the 6-episode series includes Cobie Smulders as Maria Hill, Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury and Ben Mendelsohn as the Skrull Talos\u2014 plus newcomers Olivia Colman, Emilia Clarke and Kingsley Ben-Adir. At D23 fans were shown a scene and the brand-new trailer (above) from the event series that showcases a faction of shapeshifting Skrulls who have been infiltrating Earth for years. The MCU\u2019s first animated show returns for another 9-episode series of hypothetical stories that explore alternate realities created when the timeline branches off in another direction. A trailer shown at SDCC showed many classic characters returning, as well as a glimpse of Marvel 1602, a Neil Gaiman-penned story set in the 17th century. Following the huge success of the first season of Loki on Disney+, the thought of another season is sure to please Marvel fans around the world. It is hard to judge when the new season will be released however filming is now underway, and will picks up in the aftermath of the shocking season finale when Loki finds himself in a battle for the soul of the Time Variance Authority. What we do know however is that Tom Hiddleston will reprise the role of Loki, Owen Wilson as Agent Mobius and Gugu Mbatha-Raw as Ravonna Renslayer. Ke Huy Quan has also joined the cast for the second season. The new television series stars Dominique Thorne as super genius Riri WIlliams, who has created the most advanced suit of armour since Iron Man. Sam Bailey and Angela Barnes have been hired as directors, with Ryan Coogler on the producing team. Ironheart will make her MCU debut in Black Panther: Wakanda Forever. The synopsis explains: \u201cDominique Thorne returns as Riri Williams, a young, genius inventor determined to make her mark on the world. Her unique take on building iron suits is both brilliant and flawed, and Ironheart delves into the dynamics of tech versus magic.\u201d Feige invited Anthony Ramos to the D23 stage to greet fans and share a little about his character, Parker Robbins aka The Hood. Not much has been revealed about the upcoming animated television series, X-Men \u201997 but the show is a continuation of the beloved 1992 X-Men animated show with Beau DeMayo writing and producing the show. The programme is expected be released in 2023. It\u2019s not thought to be technically part of the MCU continuity at this stage. will follow Maya Lopez/Echo, the deaf Native American adopted niece of Kingpin (crime lord in New York) detailing her life as the leader of the Tracksuit Mafia, a criminal organisation based in New York. Alaqua Cox once again reprises the role of Maya Lopez, and Vincent D\u2019Onofrio as Wilson Fisk/Kingpin and Charlie Cox as Daredevil are also rumoured to appear. Devery Jacobs will also be joining the team although it is in an undisclosed role. Audience members at D23 were treated to a special look at the upcoming series that also stars Tantoo Cardinal and Zahn McClarnon. The Marvels is the official title for Captain Marvel 2, which will see Brie Larson reprise the role of former Air Force pilot Carol Danvers. Samuel L Jackson returns as Nick Fury with Iman Vellani as Ms Marvel and Teyonah Harris as Monica Rambeau joining the team. The film is being directed by Nia DaCosta (Candyman) and will pick up the story of Ms. Marvel and Captain Marvel following the events of the former\u2019s Disney+ series. Agatha: House of Darkness is a WandaVision spinoff which sees Kathryn Hahn reprise the role of Agatha Harkness for a 9-episode series. This is the second Marvel character from a Disney+ show to have to star in a spinoff after Echo from Hawkeye. Jac Schaeffer (WandaVision) is on board the series as writer/exec producer. Production is underway now and is expected to wrap in May, 2023. This MCU series will focus on the Marvel character Simon Williams (Yahya Abdul Mateen II) who \u2014 in the comics \u2014 is the son of a wealthy industrialist who falls on hard times due to the growth of Stark Industries. In the show, he\u2019s said to be an actor and stuntman. Williams is imbued with ionic superpowers by Baron Zemo ( Daniel Bruhl) becoming an antagonist of The Avengers, before later joining their ranks. Reports suggest the show will be a Hollywood satire, with Sir Ben Kingsley\u2019s character Trevor Slattery set to appear. Daredevil is being revived at Disney+ after Charlie Cox returned as Matt Murdock in Spider-Man: No Way Home and Vincent D\u2019Onofrio reprised Kingpin in Hawkeye. A report by CultCrunch.com in May, 2022 Covert Affairs co-creators Matt Corman and Chris Ord are attached to write and executive produce a new series of the Hells Kitchen-based superhero show. The move follows the cancellation of Daredevil by Netflix, when the streaming service relinquished the rights to the character to Disney. The show, along with the other Netflix Marvel series, arrived on Disney+ in March, 2022. Cox has already warned fans that Born Again may not be R-Rated. The actor told MarkMeets: \u201cMy instinct tells me it\u2019ll be somewhere in between what we did before and what is currently on Disney+. Tonally, I imagine it\u2019ll remain sinister, dark, and painful \u2013 you know, geared towards a more mature audience. But it probably won\u2019t be as gruesome.\u201d The new 18-episode series will be released in Spring 2024. Anthony Mackie will reprise his role as Sam Wilson but in the new role as Captain America replacing the outgoing Chris Evans. The Falcon and the Winter Soldier head writer Malcolm Spellman will write the screenplay for the fourth Captain America film, along with Dalan Musson. Anthony Mackie (Sam Wilson/Captain America), Danny Ramirez (Joaquin Torres) and Carl Lumbly (Isaiah Bradley), all return to join Tim Blake Nelson (The Leader) as well as Shira Haas (Sabra). Harrison Ford will also join the MCU in Captain America, replacing the late William Hurt as Thaddeus Ross, who has risen to the post of President of the United States. \u201cThere\u2019s a dynamic between President Ross and Sam Wilson,\u201d Kevin Feige told EW. \u201cThey have a history together, but in this film, we\u2019ll be seeing the dynamic between Captain America and the president of the United States in a way that is just incredible.\u201d Marvel enters the supervillain team up genre with this highly secretive MCU project that will mark the final chapter of Phase 5 of the MCU. Jake Schreier (Robot and Frank, Paper Towns) will direct from a script by Black Widow\u2019s Eric Pearson. In the comics the Thunderbolts were a team of heroes that were formed after the death of the Avengers, but who turned out to be acting as villains. Members have included Baron Zemo, Yelena Belova, Ghost, Abomination, John Walker and Taskmaster. The Ultimate Disney Fan Event presented by VISA \u2013 brings together all the worlds of Disney under one roof for three packed days of presentations, pavilions, experiences, concerts, sneak peeks, shopping, and more. The event, which takes place September 9, 10, and 11 at the Anaheim Convention Center, provides fans with unprecedented access to Disney films, series, games, theme parks, collectibles, and celebrities/ The movie team will comprise of Julia Louis-Dreyfus (Valentina Allegra de Fontaine), David Harbour (Red Guardian), Hannah John-Kamen (Ghost), Sebastian Stan (James \u201cBucky\u201d Barnes/The Winter Soldier) and Wyatt Russell (John Walker/U.S. Agent). The esteemed team also features Black Widow\u2019s Olga Kurylenko (Taskmaster) and Florence Pugh (Yelena Belova). Having made his first appearance as part of the MCU in The Eternals, two-time Academy Award winner Mahershala Ali will headline his own movie as Blade, the vampire hunting bloodsucker previously played by Wesley Snipes. Originally written by Watchmen\u2019s Stacy Osei-Kuffour, Blade lost its director Bassam Tariq at the eleventh hour, throwing the production into last minute turmoil. \u201cDue to continued shifts in our production schedule, Bassam is no longer moving forward as director of Blade but will remain an executive producer on the film,\u201d Marvel said in a statement. \u201cWe appreciate Bassam\u2019s talent and all the work he\u2019s done getting Blade to where it is.\u201d Tariq also put out his own statement: \u201cIt\u2019s been an honour working with the wonderful folks at Marvel. \u201cWe were able to put together a killer cast and crew. Eager to see where the next director takes the film.\u201d Yann Demange, the director of White Boy Rick, was hired to replace Tariq in November 2022, with Michael Starrbury writing a new script. Hugh Jackman will return as Wolverine for the third Deadpool film opposite Ryan Reynolds in the title role. Shawn Levy will be the director of Deadpool 3 although dates for production and the release date are yet to be finalised. The second Deadpool sequel has suffered many setbacks since the release of Deadpool 2 in 2018 following complications with Disney\u2019s takeover of 20th Century Fox, which distributed the first two movies. This movie will mark Deadpool and Wolverine\u2019s arrival in the MCU. Tom Holland will return as Spider-Man for another MCU outing, it was confirmed by Marvel Studios boss Kevin Feige. \u201cAll I will say is that we have the story,\u201d Feige told Entertainment Weekly. \u201cWe have big ideas for that, and our writers are just putting pen to paper now.\u201d Details are thin on the ground so far, as it\u2019s unclear whether Peter Parker will return for his own movie, or a team-up film such as the Avenger. Talking in 2021, Spider-Man producer Amy Pascal teases more episodes in the story of the beloved webslinger. \u201cThis is not the last movie that we are going to make with Marvel \u2013 [this is not] the last Spider-Man movie,\u201d Pascal told Fandango. \u201cWe are getting ready to make the next Spider-Man movie with Tom Holland and Marvel. We\u2019re thinking of this as three films, and now we\u2019re going to go onto the next three. This is not the last of our MCU movies.\u201d The Fantastic Four will make their long-awaited MCU debut November 2024 as the first entry in Phase 6 of the MCU. The movie recently lost its director when Jon Watts quit the movie to work on his upcoming Star Wars series. WandaVision\u2019s Matt Shakman will direct. Reed Richards, Susan Storm, Ben Grimm, and Johnny Storm make up the team, and while John Krasinski recently cameoed as Reed in Doctor Strange 2, it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean he\u2019ll return for this third movie incarnation of Marvel\u2019s most beloved super-family. Talking to MarkMeets in 2023, Kevin Feige teased big plans for the Fantastic Four: \u201cFantastic Four is the foundation for everything that came after in the comics. There\u2019s certainly been versions of it [on screen], but never inhabiting the storytelling of the MCU. And that\u2019s something that is really exciting for us.\u201d Feige added, \u201cPeople will start to hear more about that soon. We plan on that being a big pillar of the MCU going forward, just the way they\u2019ve been in the comics for 50 or 60 years.\u201d Marvel Zombies is an upcoming animated television series, which is a spin-off of What If\u2026?. She-Hulk\u2019s Zeb Wells is set to write and executive produce the four-episode series. No further announcements have been made in terms of cast and production. Spider-Man: Freshman Year is an upcoming animated television series which is a prequel to Captain America: Civil War and Spider-Man: Homecoming. The voice of Peter Parker/Spider-Man is yet to be announced however Jeff Trammell is to write and executive produce the show. After being absent from our screens since the record-breaking Avengers: Endgame in 2019, the Avengers will reunite to face Kang in the first of a two-part finale for Phase 6 of the MCU. Shang-Chi\u2019s Destin Daniel Cretton will direct, with Ant-Man 3\u2019s Jeff Loveness hired to write the script. Releasing seven months after The Kang Dynasty, Secret Wars will be the epic conclusion to Phase 6 of the MCU, and with it the Phases 4-5-6 arch known as The Multiverse Saga. In the comics, the Secret Wars centered around multiversal battle between all of Marvel\u2019s beloved characters. Loki\u2019s Michael Waldron is writing the script. Simu Liu will reprise the role of Xu Shang-Chi in Destin Daniel Cretton\u2019s Shang-Chi 2. With the deal only being signed in December 2021, production has still not been announced so it is hard to determine when the sequel will be shot and subsequently released. Like Deadpool and Fantastic Four, an X-Men-centric movie will also be part of the MCU following Disney\u2019s purchase of 20th Century Fox. With the cast and director yet to be announced and Phase Four movies already slotted in for the coming years it seems a release date is still some years away. Don Cheadle is set to reprise the role as James Rhodes/War Machine in the upcoming movie Armor Wars, with a script from Yassir Lester. Ant-Man and The Wasp\u2019s Walton Goggins will also appear as Sonny Burch. will be different and I think it\u2019s going to be pretty unique,\u201d Cheadle told Yahoo in 2021. \u201cWe\u2019re breaking the story now in the writers\u2019 room and figuring out what direction it\u2019s gonna take, but I think people are going to be very surprised at where we\u2019re gonna go with this, for sure.\u201d The project was originally conceived as a Disney+ series, but evolved into a full movie in late 2022. Producer Nate Moore explained: \u201cWhen you\u2019re talking about a show that wants to be about seeing all the cool armours and Don Cheadle interacting with all these armours and, sort of, the legacy of Tony Stark? That became kind of cost prohibitive to do as a show.\u201d Following the box-office hit, Black Panther and its sequel, director Ryan Coogler announced that a television series is also on the way. The cast is yet to be announced so it seems like the series is still some years away.",

Like many new The post Beginner\u2019s Guide to Investing in Rental Properties first appeared on MarkMeets | Entertainment, Music, Movie, TV & London Film Premiere News.",
    "content": "PROPERTY If you\u2019re thinking about investing in the rental housing market, you may be wondering how to get started. Like many new investors, you probably have an optimistic vision for your new investment property: reliable tenants, passive income and eventual financial freedom. But how do you get there from where you are now? Like everything else, you start with the basics. Understanding even the rudimentary principles of rental real estate can help you kickstart a successful investing career. This includes knowledge of property types, return on investment, mortgages and the legal steps to acquire a property. The research you do up front may help you avoid a misstep that could sink your investment. Here\u2019s how to get started with rental real estate investing: Deciding between a residential and commercial property Before you buy a property, you need to decide whether you\u2019re looking to purchase residential or commercial property. Both types can help you reach your end goal of passive income. However, they have some important distinctions. Assessing property value Now that you\u2019ve selected a property type, you need some options. Maybe you\u2019ve chosen a neighborhood or a few properties you\u2019re considering. How do you know which one is your best move financially? Here are two crucial factors to consider when assessing property value: Following the 1% rule Qualitative factors are one way to measure return on investment, but you should also have the numbers to back up your assessment. Will the property generate consistent rental income? Or will the property ultimately require more time and money than it can return to you? Fortunately, there\u2019s a rule of thumb for assessing the strength of an investment that you can apply before you make it. The holds that if you can reasonably rent a property out at a rate equal to one percent of the starting mortgage, it\u2019s likely to be profitable. You should know whether the rate you\u2019ve calculated is reasonable based on demand and the rates of similar properties in the area. Let\u2019s say you buy a duplex for $310,000. You make a 25% down payment, equal to $77,500. That leaves you with a $232,500 mortgage. One percent of this remaining mortgage is $2,325, which halved is $1,162.5. If you can rent both units of the duplex for around $1160, the property is likely a good investment. The 1% rule is a quick trick for evaluating the potential of an investment. However, it should not be taken as a definitive verdict. The soundness of any investment depends on many factors, including your current cash flow, the property\u2019s condition, property tax rates, locational trends and other factors. The 1% rule will get you in the ballpark, but do your due diligence. Financing your property Finally, you\u2019ve chosen a property. If you\u2019re like most investors, you\u2019ll need to borrow money to purchase it. This means finding a mortgage lender, negotiating terms and making a down payment. Let\u2019s break down mortgage types, down payments and interest rates: Legal checklist As the buyer, it\u2019s your job to get ahead of a purchase before any problems arise. Here\u2019s what you should do to ensure your investment is properly protected before you make it official: Every successful investor started exactly where you are now. The research and dedication you devote up front can help you achieve financial freedom, too. You\u2019re now prepared to buy your first property and get started in real estate investing.",

    "content": "Data breaches have become increasingly common in the digital age, which results in the reevaluation of security methods many organizations employ. One of the most common ways to manage data securely online is by using virtual data rooms. This guide will cover everything you need to know about data room security \u2014 what data roms are, how they work, and why they should be used by any business that handles confidential information. By reading on and checking a few data room reviews , you will understand how these tools can keep your valuable assets safe while ensuring complete regulatory compliance. What is a data room and why is it safe? A data room is a secure digital repository that can be used to store, manage, and access sensitive information.

Data breaches can devastate companies, including reputational damage, loss of customer trust, and financial losses. How to check if your Facebook account was part of the data breach?

You can also visit Have I Been Pwned? a website that keeps track of data breaches, and enter your email address to see if it\u2019s been compromised. If your address is on the list, your Facebook account was likely part of the data breach. Remember that even if your account wasn\u2019t part of this specific breach, practicing good security habits like using a strong password and two-factor authentication is always a good idea. What to do if your Facebook account was part of the data breach? If your Facebook account was part of the data breach, you could do a few things to protect yourself: Change your Facebook password and enable two-factor authentication.

For example, if you see a Facebook session open on a device you don\u2019t recognize, log out of it. This will help to prevent someone from accessing your account without your permission. Similarly, if you get an email or notification from Facebook about a login from an unrecognized device or location, change your password and security settings immediately. And if you have any concerns about whether your account has been compromised, contact Facebook directly. How to keep your account secure? In the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, Facebook has been under fire for handling user data. To make sure your account is as secure as possible, follow these steps: Use a strong password. Your password should be at least eight characters long and include a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols. Avoid using easily guessed words like your name or birthdate. Enable two-factor authentication. This adds an extra layer of security to your account by requiring you to enter a code from your phone whenever you log in. Be aware of what you\u2019re sharing. Think carefully before posting personal information or photos on Facebook. Once something is shared, it can be hard to take back. Keep your software up to date. Ensure you\u2019re running the latest web browser version of Facebook\u2019s app. Regular updates help fix security vulnerabilities that hackers could exploit. Watch out for scams. Don\u2019t click on links or give out personal information to people or businesses you don\u2019t know and trust. Conclusion Checking data breaches can provide valuable insight into which of your accounts have been compromised. Even if the violation does not affect you, it helps to be aware of potential issues and take appropriate action as needed. Fortunately, there are a few simple steps that you can follow to check for data breaches on Facebook in just a matter of minutes. This way, you will know exactly what information has been leaked and how to protect yourself from future security threats.",

    "content": "VR has become more mainstream than I ever imagined it would, back when I first got my hands on an original Oculus Rift dev kit. I know people who aren't really into games but who still own a Quest 2 headset (opens in new tab) for Beat Saber shenanigans (opens in new tab) . For those who are deep into the VR landscape, you've got high-end offerings like the Pimax headsets with expanded fields of view. (opens in new tab) But even with Pimax's great trade-in deals (opens in new tab) , not everyone is ready to slap that kind of money on a VR headset. For those looking for that wide field-of-view feeling on a budget, one DIY enthusiast might just have you covered. ShodaVR (opens in new tab) on Twitter (spotted by Mixed-News (opens in new tab) ) has devised an effect that mimics a wider range of vision on their Vive headset. This hack looks like an easy one, and it can be tried out by most people with a VR headset. All the effect requires is an array of LEDs placed inside the headset. These LEDs are then programmed to mimic the border lights that you're seeing. It's the same way ambient lighting works in conjunction with TVs and monitors, and even relatively cheap setups like Govee Dreamlights (opens in new tab) can make a huge difference. In a room it helps to paint your environment with the light you'd have in the world on your screen and offers a greater sense of immersion. If you've experienced a good ambient lighting setup you know how effective this trick can be. Shoda has posted several videos of their hacked setup working on Twitter, including a blind test from their partner (opens in new tab) . Even with the current relatively simple setup it seems to be leaving an impression. The next steps are to get some diffusing happening in the headset, as well as 3D printing an insert. Shoda is even gauging interest to see if it's worth developing the accessory further. Best VR headset (opens in new tab) : which kit should you choose? Best graphics card (opens in new tab) : you need serious GPU power for VR Best gaming laptop (opens in new tab) : don't get tied to your desktop in VR Given how well this seems to work it's almost a mystery why headset makers haven't already implemented this kind of tech. Extra lights in the headset may add to the bulk, but given Shoda was able to power this from the Vive itself, adding relatively little in perceived heft, it's a curious one. Especially given LEDs are cheap, lightweight, and low power drawers. It looks like Shoda has put a lot of work into this build, making a nice clean end result which is likely better than what I could ever achieve. The execution is already looking quite professional, but perhaps more will be discovered as the prototyping continues. My \"VR Ambilight\" mock up is done, it feels ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE, the \"Fake FOV\" boost is so trippy, I just need to diffuse the little better then it's time to 3D print a fully enclosed facial interface. @Thrilluwu Orion club pops with this! Making one for the Index now. pic.twitter.com/p4MktC3p0h February 18, 2023 Hopefully this is as easy an implementation as it seems because it sure looks like a cool one. I'd love to shove some LEDs into my Quest headset to get that added dose of immersion while in VR. I tend to run mine through the computer and thus could use screen mirroring software to control the notes. However, as Shoda notes, getting standalone Quest games would be more difficult and might be on the backburner for now. If it all works out this might be one of the cheapest and easiest ways to upgrade your VR headset. It may even lead way to further advancements. Shoda talks about cool game effects that could be implemented like having it flash red around the outside if you're being attacked from behind. These would likely need to be set up on the game developer end of things, but if these ambient lighting LEDs take off, who knows.",

    "content": "Institutional investors may have gotten the jitters on crypto in the wake of the regulatory crackdown in the United States, with digital asset investment products seeing the largest weekly outflow of 2023. On Feb. 20, institutional crypto fund manager CoinShares reported that digital asset investment products saw outflows totaling $32 million last week, the largest outflow of the year. This week in Fund Flows, by our Head of Research @jbutterfill : Digital assets see US$32m in outflows, but rising prices push AuM to highest since August 2022. Read the full report - https://t.co/EIXblrOBcL Get a comprehensive view of last week\u2019s crypto flows (1/5) pic.twitter.com/WvJk15WAWs The outflow comes in the wake of a massive crackdown on the digital asset industry in the U.S. which has targeted everything from staking services to stablecoins to crypto custody as the Securities and Exchange Commission ramps up what industry analysts have dubbed its war on crypto. Outflows hit $62 million midway through last week but slowed by the end of it as sentiment improved, added CoinShares analyst James Butterfill. The majority of those outflows, or 78%, were from Bitcoin ( BTC ) related investment products and there was an inflow of $3.7 million to Bitcoin short funds. The firm blamed the regulatory crackdown for the increased outflows. However, negative sentiment from institutional investors was not mirrored by the broader markets which saw a 10% gain for the period. This pushed total assets under management for institutional products to $30 million, the highest level since August 2022, noted Butterfill. There were also outflows for Ethereum ( ETH ) and mixed-asset funds but blockchain equities bucked the trend with inflows totaling $9.6 million for the week. Related: Digital asset investment products see highest inflows since July 2022: Report Institutions started pouring capital back into crypto funds in January with inflows for the last week of the month totaling $117 million, reaching a six-month high. However, funds have seen outflows for the past fortnight following four weeks of inflows in January. The regulatory enforcement action responsible for the sentiment shift includes the SEC\u2019s charges against Kraken for its staking services on Feb. 9. A few days later it sued Paxos over the minting of Binance USD (BUSD), and it also proposed changes targeted at crypto firms operating as custodians last week.",

    "description": "The creator of a Bitcoin Ordinals protocol fork that works on Litecoin said he did it all for a crypto bounty of a few thousand dollars.",
    "content": "A small monetary bounty and an aptitude for coding were all it took to fork the Ordinals protocol to the world\u2019s second-ever cryptocurrency network, Litecoin ( LTC ) earlier this week, its creator told Cointelegraph. On Feb. 18, an Australian software engineer by the name of Anthony Guerrera posted a repository to GitHub that forked the Bitcoin ( BTC ) Ordinals protocol to Litecoin. This allowed for nonfungible token (NFT)-like assets on the Litecoin network in much the same way it had made it to Bitcoin earlier in the year. In an interview with Cointelegraph, Guerrera said he was spurred to make a Litecoin Ordinal fork due to a 5 LTC bounty posted by the pseudonymous Twitter user Indigo Nakamoto on Feb. 11 that rose to 22 LTC, or about $2,000, to anyone who was first to successfully create a fork. 22 $LTC to port Ordinals to #Litecoin from: + 5 $LTC @indigo_nakamoto + 5 $LTC @ryanwrights + 5 $LTC @MASTERBTCLTC + 2 $LTC @ChiefLitecoin + 5 $LTC @finitemaz https://t.co/7X4JfMzq97 \u201cI knew it was possible because Litecoin has taproot as well as SegWit,\u201d Guerrera said, adding: Taproot and SegWit are the names given to the Bitcoin protocol updates that aimed to improve the privacy and efficiency of the network but also allowed for NFT-like structures called \u201cinscriptions\u201d to be attached to satoshis . The cost to inscribe an image onto the Bitcoin blockchain can cost tens of dollars depending on its size but Guerrera said the cost to inscribe a litoshi \u2014 the LTC equivalent to a satoshi \u2014 is \u201cabout two cents.\u201d A point of contention amongst Bitcoiners is the block space Ordinals take up on the network due to their data size being far greater than transactions. Guerrera doesn\u2019t think this issue will be as prominent on Litecoin due to its larger block size but could still possibly eventuate. Guerrera said his LTC fork took around one week to create as \u201cthe changes were quite simple.\u201d He explained he updated the Ordinals code to work with inputs from the Litecoin network instead of the Bitcoin network. Parameters that differed between the blockchains such as the total possible number of coins and block time creation differences also had to be accounted for in the fork. In a Feb. 19 tweet, Guerrera said he\u2019d inscribed the first ever Litecoin Ordinal, putting the MimbleWimble whitepaper onto the blockchain in the so-named \u201cinscription 0.\u201d The first #Litecoin #Ordinal has been inscribed on the Litecoin blockchain. The mimblewimble whitepaper will live within Litecoin forever \u24c2\ufe0f #MWEB ! $LTC $BTC #NFT @SatoshiLite @finitemaz @ryanwrights @MASTERBTCLTC @ChiefLitecoin @indigo_nakamoto pic.twitter.com/ICLkTMjwRW The inscription of the whitepaper is in the wake of the May 2022 Mimblewimble Extension Blocks (MWEB) upgrade that allows Litecoin users to opt-in to confidential transactions and other blockchain improvements such as helping reduce excess and unnecessary transaction data. Related: How the Ordinals movement will benefit the Bitcoin blockchain \u201cI wanted to dedicate the first inscription to that and make it aware that Litecoin now has this privacy sidechain attached to it,\u201d Guerrera said. As for the future of the forked protocol, Guerrera will \u201ckeep contributing to this fork as much as I can\u201d and port across updates from the original Ordinals. \u201cI probably want to hand over this as I don't want it to take too much of my time,\u201d he added. \u201cI'm doing other things. I've got other things on my plate.\u201d",

The original iPhone was sealed in its original packaging and had never been opened, according to LCG Auctions. Karen Green, the original owner of the phone, went on the talk show \u201cThe Doctor & The Diva\u201d to have it appraised in 2019, where experts estimated it was worth about $5,000, largely due to it being in its original packaging and it being an 8GB model.

Are you picking the right gas at the pump? How to know Twenty-seven bids were placed on the iPhone between Feb. 2 and Sunday, with the first bid starting at $2,500. Other first-generation iPhones have recently been auctioned off for about $35,000 in August and over $39,000 in October , according to LCG Auctions. When the first-generation 8GB iPhone came out in 2007, it cost $599. Now, Apple has just released its latest version of the product in 2022, with the iPhone 14 costing between $799 and $1,199, according to Apple\u2019s website.

    "description": "The former hedge fund manager suggested that top-tier NFTs essentially serve as status symbols, and should see significant upside during crypto boom cycles.",
    "content": "Real Vision CEO and co-founder Raoul Pal believes nonfungible tokens (NFTs) will act similar to \u201chigh-end property\u201d in the traditional economy, outperforming Ether ( ETH ) during crypto market boom cycles. In an hour-long YouTube video published on Feb. 20, the former JPMorgan executive offered a run-down of what he felt most bullish about when it came to NFTs, including key use cases for the asset class, its underlying tech , and its potential performance relative to Ether. Boom! Here you go... My deep dive thesis and understanding on NFT's, what they mean, where they are going and why they are important and more.. It's all Ive got right now but will evolve! I think it's a really important piece. Appreciate any feedback! https://t.co/JMOdBnmrxh Pal said just as \u201chigh-end property\u201d often outperforms the market when the \u201ceconomy recovers,\u201d the same is likely to occur with certain NFTs during crypto boom cycles. \u201cAnd it tends to outperform the rest of the market. And I think the same thing will happen in ETH economy,\u201d he added. He highlighted that major collections such as CryptoPunks and the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) have become status symbols in the crypto community, much like owning a luxury house, car, or item from a famous brand, which offer access to exclusive clubs, or what he dubbed as \u201cmini network-states.\u201d He suggested that NFTs serve as a \u201cway of owning property in the ETH economy,\u201d adding: Looking back, the former hedge fund manager said NFTs started to draw his attention in 2022 as he started to \u201cunderstand the power of what they are and what they can do,\u201d such as being able to transfer \u201cvalue\u201d via blockchains and automated smart contracts. He also pointed to NFTs' uses in the resolution of contracts, noting that blockchain-based ledgers can offer verifiable transparency on what has been agreed between people, while smart contracts can essentially do away with unnecessary third parties. Pal stated that since he got into NFTs, he\u2019s allocated roughly 10% of his ETH holdings into \u201cpremium NFTs\u201d such as CryptoPunks and BAYC NFT. Related: Nifty News: Yuga in doghouse over Kennel Club logo, NFT marketplace wars rage on and more He suggested that such collections potentially offer more upside potential than downside risk, as they have managed to sustain a decent level of value during the bear market. He also believes the price of ETH is likely to increase moving forward. \u201cWhen you look at the price of Crypto Punks and Bored Apes, they\u2019ve remained incredibly stable in ETH terms. Yes, they had a blow-off top and they came back and they\u2019ve traded about 65 ETH forever. And that\u2019s interesting to me because they didn\u2019t fall much further. They had a sharp spike in June in the big crypto collapse. But other than that, they\u2019ve just rallied back and stayed at 65 ETH. So whatever ETH does, they\u2019re just mirroring it,\u201d he said.",

    "content": "MAMARONECK, N.Y. \u2014 Project Veritas founder James O\u2019Keefe said in a speech posted online Monday that he has been removed as the right-wing group\u2019s leader. In remarks that appeared to have been made at a Project Veritas\u2019 office, O\u2019Keefe said the board had stripped him of all decision-making. The move comes after the board reportedly put him on leave from his role as chairman amid complaints about his treatment of staff at the organization, which is known for using hidden cameras and hiding identities to try to ensnare journalists in embarrassing conversations and to reveal supposed liberal bias. \u201cSo currently, I have no job at Project Veritas,\u201d O\u2019Keefe said in the video. \u201cI have no position here based upon what the board has done. So I\u2019m announcing to you all that today on President\u2019s Day, I\u2019m packing up my personal belongings.\u201d In a statement released later Monday, the group\u2019s board of directors said it had uncovered \u201cfinancial malfeasance\u201d and accused O\u2019Keefe of spending \u201can excessive amount of donor funds in the last three years on personal luxuries.\u201d According to the group, those included \u201c$14,000 on a charter flight to meet someone to fix his boat under the guise of meeting with a donor\u201d; $60,000 in losses from dance events; more than $150,000 \u201cin Black Cars in the last 18 months\u201d; and others. The statement added that O\u2019Keefe had been suspended in recent weeks. It said he was invited to meet with the board to discuss financial issues and staff retention and morale, but he ignored those entreaties and \u201ctoday ... decided to remove his belongings from Project Veritas headquarters.\u201d O\u2019Keefe, who choked up and wiped away tears during his remarks in the video, said several times that the nearly 45-minute speech was for staff internally, but it was posted on the Vimeo platform. The announcement comes after the group\u2019s executive director and several board members put out a statement last week saying that \u201ca number of our staff members provided leadership with some verbal feedback describing real management concerns regarding the treatment of people and our internal processes.\u201d Project Veritas, which identifies itself as a news organization, is best known for its hidden camera stings that have embarrassed news outlets, labor organizations and Democratic politicians. O\u2019Keefe founded the nonprofit group 13 years ago, and its most recent IRS filings provided to charity regulators in Florida show it brought in more than $20 million in revenue in 2021. Last year, two Florida residents pleaded guilty to selling a diary and other items from President Joe Biden\u2019s daughter to Project Veritas for $40,000, prosecutors said. As part of its investigation, the FBI searched the group\u2019s New York offices and the homes of some employees in 2021. Neither Project Veritas nor any staffers have been charged with a crime, and the group has said its activities were protected by the First Amendment. Messages seeking comment were left with O\u2019Keefe, the group\u2019s executive director, and attorneys for Project Veritas and O\u2019Keefe, as well as other officials with the organization, which is based in Mamaroneck, New York.",

    "content": "The influence of crypto is hard to deny, and people accepting it harness its potential and revenue. The environment for settlements with virtual money is a crypto exchange. Here, investors trade and profit, while those willing to level up start their own platforms. Here comes Where To Start? Decide whether to develop software from ground zero or purchase it turnkey. In the first scenario, be ready to invest tens of thousands of dollars, develop for a year, and further fix bugs. With turnkey software, you research the market, analyse available options, and review the previous cases of your potential provider. What To Look For In Provider? Crypto exchanges are an innate tool for transacting digital currency, meaning software cannot be less than perfect because every error or lag repels the audience and drains profit. Now, in detail about the features of worthy software for implementing cryptocurrency exchange. As an exchange owner, you must guarantee the safety of your clients\u2019 funds. The security of a platform is ensured by a quality code. If developers have little to no idea how money can be hooked, one day, there can be no on an exchange balance sheet. Security aspects involve KYC modules, anti-fraud system, 2FA. Stable engines that match buyers and sellers even during high volatility or intensive load ensure excellent user experience. Moreover, a well-thought system of accessible orders, OTC functionality, engines for spot trading, integration with fiat gateways, and other technicalities attract a professional public with big money. The ability of your site to communicate with other services affects its performance and rating. For instance, API allows users to view exchange rates in real-time, with all changes instantly reflected on the screen, ensures a decent flow of referral programs, provides flawless customer service through online chats, etc. Even though software is all-prepared, it is vital that you be able to get support from your provider. In an ideal world, your provider assists you at all stages of implementation, from software customization to platform promotion, sharing their experience and explaining possible pitfalls. Bottomline Trading volumes on crypto exchanges reach $400,000\u2013600,000 a day, with their owners making several thousand dollars a day. This is due to the fact that they go for non-standard ways of business activity and choose reliable partners.",

    "content": "My favorite part of a flight is the takeoff. You turn that last corner on the taxiway then the excitement happens. Engines roar, you\u2019re thrown back in your seat then rapidly accelerate to 150 knots before rising above the earth. Saturday\u2019s game against St Mary\u2019s is the takeoff, Thursday against San Diego is the last turn on the taxiway. After a total dismantling of LMU and beating a talented and surprisingly tough Pepperdine in Malibu, it\u2019d be easy to lightly regard the lowly Toreros. St. Mary\u2019s learned that lesson in San Diego last Thursday before their Saturday game against BYU . The Gaels blew a 17-point halftime lead at the \u201cSlim Gym\u201d and didn\u2019t score in the final seven minutes of a 24-4 Torero run. The Gaels squeaked out a 3-point victory against a San Diego team missing three starters. Thursday at the Kennel shouldn\u2019t provide as much drama. San Diego is 8-8 at home but only 3-9 on the road. I hate to mention this in light of the LMU loss, but Gonzaga has won the last 22 home games in the series dating back 23 years. San Diego Toreros, 11-17 (4-10 WCC), KenPom #206 Expectations were high in San Diego when the University hired Steve Lavin as the new men\u2019s basketball coach. Lavin was a coaching wunderkind who took over the reins of the UCLA Bruins at the age of 32. He had success, going to at least the Sweet 16 five of his first six seasons. In the seventh though, UCLA had their first losing record since the 40\u2019s and he was fired. What followed was a seven year stint at ESPN, coaching for five years at St John\u2019s with mixed results, then another seven years as a basketball commentator before the San Diego hire. Like most WCC teams, the Toreros have taken full advantage of the transfer portal. Who wouldn\u2019t want to spend their last year or two of college at San Diego (or LA, San Francisco or even Portland). In fact, six of the seven Toreros with the most minutes were transfers. San Diego is led by 6\u20196\u201d 240 lbs. Marcellus Earlington (17.3 ppg). Earlington could have been a two-time National Champion. A star tight end and defensive end in high school, he had scholarship offers from several schools including the University of Georgia. The fifth-year senior spent his first three seasons at St. John\u2019s. He moves great for a big man and has a pretty sweet touch, 37%, from deep. Fifth-year senior and Denver transfer 6\u20194\u201d guard Jase Townsend (15.3 ppg) is second on the team is scoring. Listed at 6\u20196\u201d and 200 lbs with stints at Duquesne and Oregon, sixth year senior guard Eric Williams (9.5 rpg) leads the team and WCC in rebounding. Lastly, after spending time at Loyola Marymount and Weber St., 6\u20193\u201d guard Seikou Sisoho Jawara ( 3.0 apg) leads in assists. Lavin has used 14 different starts this season and there\u2019s no telling who will play Thursday. St. Mary\u2019s struggled with a San Diego team missing leading scorer Earlington, leading rebounder Williams and assists leader Sisoho Jawara. If Earlington or Williams don\u2019t play, expect big minutes from fifth-year senior, Lehigh transfer and Seattle native 6\u2019 11\u201d center Nic Lynch. KenPom predicts a 95-75 Gonzaga win and ESPN gives the Zags a 98.4% chance for victory Great offense vs. Terrible defense The 205 points Gonzaga scored this past weekend moved them to the top of both KenPom and Barttorvik in offensive efficiency. Conversely, not only is San Diego the lowest ranked WCC team in KenPom, they also have one of the worst defenses in the nation. KenPom ranks them as 335 th in defensive efficiency while Barttorvik show them slightly better at 331 st . San Diego\u2019s porous defense coupled with their uncertain injury situation should give Gonzaga a chance to jump out to a big lead in the first half and hopefully coast in the second. Rested starters from an easy Thursday game will be an advantage against St. Mary\u2019s. Guards staying consistent Besides their great work for the Community Cancer Fund, the five guards above; Bolton, Smith, Hickman, Sallis and Strawther demolished LMU this past Thursdays. With Drew Timme without a field goal, the above guards were 21 for 28 from the field. An ostentatious outburst of offensive output. But, for the first 15 minutes of the second half against Pepperdine, the same quintet was 0 for 12. During the last five minutes of the Pepperdine game, both Rasir Bolton and Julian Strawther came up big to clinch the victory, lack of guard scoring for 15 minutes kept the game competitive. If there has been a consistent problem with the Gonzaga offense this season, it\u2019s been inconsistent guard play. There have been several signs of that turning around though, Julian Strawter\u2019s played like an All-American in the last three games. Dongs Killer Rasir Bolton scored 21 and 23 against USF and dropped double figures in the last three games. Hunter Sallis had 13 against USF while Smith and Hickman both have carried the offensive load in individual games. With three outstanding three point shooters on the team (Smith .493%, Strawther .433% and Bolton .408) this year\u2019s team is in the unique position of being able to beat opponents from the inside and the outside. With March only a week away, this team will go as far in the NCAA tournament as these guards take them. If at least two of the five have a good game. As mentioned above, San Diego\u2019s poor defense and injuries should provide ample opportunity for open jumpers. A chance for all of them to build confidence and sharpen the sword for Saturday. Continued defensive improvement I know it\u2019s hard to believe a team that\u2019s given up 80+ points to three of their last four opponents is getting better and I can\u2019t use definitive analytics to back it up, but it just feel\u2019s like that\u2019s the case. LMU was smothered by GU\u2019s defense. I\u2019ve seen far less completely blown defensive assignments, the double-teams have been swarming, Watson\u2019s hands and Sallis drawing charges are incredible and finally expired opponent\u2019s shot clocks seem to happen at least twice a game. Defense will always be this team\u2019s Achilles heal, but as long as rotations stay sharp and transition three-pointers are minimized, this team can score enough points to be competitive against any team in the nation.",

    "description": "Hinman emails could have no sway in SEC v. Ripple case, according to legal expert",
    "content": "Legal expert Jesse Hynes has claimed that internal Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) emails could prove irrelevant to the ongoing SEC v. Ripple case. In a tweet, Hynes warned that the emails could hold no sway, regardless of whether or not they contain any damning information. The comments were made in regards to a motion to intervene, in which Roslyn Layton requested access to SEC documents relating to a speech given by former SEC Director of Corporation Finance William Hinman in June 2018. Layton is a columnist and regulatory policy scholar who has written a number of articles about the Hinman speech documents and their significance for the case. Ripple Labs used some of these documents to support its summary judgment motion, but the SEC moved to seal them on Dec. 22, 2022. window.coinzilla_display = window.coinzilla_display || []; var c_display_preferences = {}; c_display_preferences.zone = \"5335d7792eb489ae565\"; c_display_preferences.width = \"300\"; c_display_preferences.height = \"250\"; coinzilla_display.push(c_display_preferences); Ads window.coinzilla_display = window.coinzilla_display || []; var c_display_preferences = {}; c_display_preferences.zone = \"5335d7792eb489ae565\"; c_display_preferences.width = \"300\"; c_display_preferences.height = \"250\"; coinzilla_display.push(c_display_preferences); Ads Hynes claimed that the content of the emails, even if it exposed the SEC's corruption, might be irrelevant to whether or not XRP is considered an unregistered security. Related Ankr Records 43% Growth, Here Are 2 Key Trends to Watch Such a scenario could be a blow to those who believe the internal emails could play a significant role in the outcome of the case, given the potential evidence they contain. In her filing, Layton requests that the court release these documents to the public and denies the SEC's motion to keep them sealed. The Forbes columnist claims that she has no financial stake in Ripple or XRP, nor financial interest in this case. However, her coverage has been extremely biased in Ripple's favor. The filing raises arguments based on the First Amendment and federal common law that endow the press and the public with a \"potent and fundamental presumptive right\" to access \"judicial documents.\" The SEC v. Ripple case has enormous significance for the future of the crypto industry. Ripple and its executives are facing allegations that they raised over $1.3 billion by selling unregistered securities in the form of XRP. The outcome of the case could set a precedent for the cryptocurrency market as a whole.",

His sentiment was reiterated by Chandler Song, Co-Founder, and CEO at Ankr Network, who indicated that the partnership is a throttle push on its mission to provide blockchain technology to enterprise investors globally. Song noted. This was a critical step in bringing blockchain infrastructure to a growing sector of the digital economy. The partnership, while an incredible milestone for Ankr, is also a key indicator of how far the decentralized web has come in integrating with the crucial players in every layer of web systems. The result will be an era of extremely prolific building for blockchain-based applications from new Web3 projects as well as large enterprises entering the space. Bigger Picture of Ankr Network and Microsoft Corp The partnership between Ankr Network and Microsoft Corp is a testament to the fact that the crypto market is here to stay. Despite the fall of several crypto-related companies in 2022 that resulted in a loss of over $100 billion, institutional investors are extremely bullish on the long-term success of the blockchain and the crypto industry. The announcement noted. By combining Ankr\u2019s solutions with Azure and Microsoft Marketplace, we have the chance to put forth an incredibly powerful industry solution that creates a stronger infrastructure layer for the space.

Musk has also promised, over and over again, to build a more transparent Twitter \u2014 one that makes it clear when a government agency requests a user\u2019s data, or asks to take an account offline. \u201c Transparency is the key to trust ,\u201d he tweeted around the same time. For a decade, Twitter published rundowns twice a year of all of those government requests. But under Musk, that appears to have ended. Despite Musk\u2019s rhetoric about government bullying of social media, his company hasn\u2019t published one of the formerly regular transparency reports detailing what governments are demanding from Twitter \u2014 and whether the company is bending to them. It\u2019s a development that\u2019s horrified privacy advocates and former Twitter employees alike. \u201cWe entrust our most sensitive, private, and important information to tech companies \u2014 they\u2019re privy to the conversations, photos, social connections, and location data of almost everyone online,\u201d Josh Richman, a spokesperson for the Electronic Freedom Foundation, said in a statement. \u201cThe reports shed crucial light on whether or not tech companies have users\u2019 backs, or if they\u2019re rolling over and compromising users\u2019 data. Any company that walks away from making such reports is taking a big step backward.\u201d Musk did not immediately respond to Rolling Stone \u2019s request for comment on this story. In years past, Twitter routinely published data about how many demands it had received from governments, and how many enforcement actions it had taken against users accounts or tweets. The reports also detailed how and when Twitter fought the government over requests or gag orders. In 2014, the company even sued the Obama administration to quash a gag order and disclose its receipt of National Security Letters, which allow law enforcement to obtain information from Internet service providers without a warrant. Editor\u2019s picks The 200 Greatest Singers of All Time The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time The 100 Greatest TV Shows of All Time The 100 Best Albums of 2022 Twitter\u2019s last transparency report \u2014 published in July 2022 and covering the last six months of 2021 \u2014 found that the U.S. government made more requests for account data than any other government, accounting for over 24 percent of Twitter\u2019s global requests. The FBI, Department of Justice, and Secret Service \u201cconsistently submitted the greatest percentage of requests for the six previous reporting periods.\u201d Requests from the U.S. government were down seven percent from the last reporting period but Twitter\u2019s compliance rate went up 13 percent in the latter half of 2021. The kinds of transparency reports that Twitter used to publish \u201ccan be really valuable in terms of showing which governments are making the most requests, how much platforms are pushing back on government, what are the trends over time and what kinds of things are they asking for,\u201d Evelyn Douek, a professor at Stanford Law School who studies technology and public policy, tells Rolling Stone . \u201cThat can be a really important accountability mechanism not just for platforms, but also governments. You see which governments are applying the most pressure to platforms.\u201d The Musk-approved Twitter Files posts have offered glimpses of government officials making demands on Twitter. But the releases provide only a small \u2014 and politically selective \u2014 window on the company\u2019s relationships with officialdom. The lack of a clear commitment to continued transparency reports going forward means that Twitter users could have less information about how the company is handling their data, despite Musk\u2019s rhetoric. \u201cElon talked a lot about the power of transparency. But the way Elon and his enablers interpret transparency is a rather creative use of the word. It\u2019s not meaningful transparency in the way the industry defines it ,\u201d one former Twitter employee familiar with the reports tells Rolling Stone . It\u2019s unclear whether Twitter will continue to publish such reports or if the company even has the ability to, given its lack of staff. The reports, three former staffers familiar with them say, were labor intensive even when the company was fully staffed. \u201cWe were working on the transparency reports, then all the program leads were immediately fired, and the remaining people that could\u2019ve worked on the reports all left subsequently,\u201d one former staffer says. \u201cI\u2019m not aware of any people left [at Twitter] who could produce these transparency reports.\u201d The former Twitter staffer adds, \u201cIt\u2019s really a problem that there\u2019s no transparency data from 2022 anywhere.\u201d It\u2019s one of several topics that Musk\u2019s Twitter has gone silent on, former employees say. \u201cThere\u2019s meat-and-potatoes transparency, the kind that\u2019s required by a bunch of international regulations. That\u2019s no longer being done. Then there\u2019s the fancy, extra transparency around information operations and inauthentic behavior. That shit went out the window right after Elon came in,\u201d the former staffer says. Trending Trump Used $10 Million of Donor Money to Pay His Personal Legal Bills Trump Defends Putin as Biden Visits War-Torn Ukraine Netflix Probes Alex Murdaugh\u2019s Trail of Dead Bodies and Missing Millions Rolling Stones Recorded a New Song With Paul McCartney As Rolling Stone reported in December, Twitter\u2019s Trust and Safety staff was prepared to publish a report about a network of troll accounts linked to the Chinese government and dedicated to harassment of women journalists reporting on human rights abuses in the country. That report, along with \u201c dozens \u201d of others about foreign government troll networks that Twitter staff had completed in the days before its sale, was never published. Musk himself appears somewhat resistant to the idea of reporting on government efforts to manipulate his platform. In early February, he criticized reporting from the State Department\u2019s Global Engagement Center calling out Russian influence operations as \u201cgovernment censorship & media manipulation\u201d and \u201c a threat to our democracy .\u201d",

    "content": "Dear Annie: My wife and I live overseas and have three children, all of whom live in the same city in the United States. Our youngest grandchild was born to our second son about 10 months ago. We came to the States in hopes of spending time with the baby. During the three months we were here (we stayed with our other son), we saw our granddaughter a grand total of four times, all of which were during large family get-togethers. We were never invited to our son\u2019s house to spend time with the baby. We know from social media that our daughter-in-law\u2019s mother was there all the time, however. Though we\u2019re not big fans of our daughter-in-law because of how controlling she is with our son, we\u2019ve never treated her with anything other than kindness, so we don\u2019t know why this is happening. My wife and I are scared of saying anything for fear of being cut off entirely. Is there anything we can do? Should we say something? -- Scared to Say Something Dear Scared: The worst thing is to do nothing. Your goal should be to have a fully honest, loving and open relationship with your son and daughter-in-law and granddaughter. Sometimes being vulnerable and expressing your feelings lovingly has the ability to shift perspective and open the lines of communication. People are not mind readers. Maybe they thought you wanted to stay at your son\u2019s house, and it would be easier just to see your granddaughter at family gatherings. Maybe his wife is suffering from postpartum depression and her mother came to help out. Regardless of the reason, it might not have anything to do with their feelings toward you. My point is that it is entirely possible that they did not know that you wanted to go over to their house -- if you didn\u2019t tell them. So long as you don\u2019t attack your son and daughter-in-law, it should be well received. Just express yourself from a place of love and wanting to get to know your granddaughter better. According to author Brene Brown, \u201cVulnerability is our most accurate way to measure courage, and we literally do that as researchers.\u201d Vulnerability allows them to assess fearlessness, said Brown. \u201cWe can measure how brave you are by how vulnerable you\u2019re willing to be.\u201d Vulnerability is the willingness to show up and share your authentic self while knowing that you have no control over the outcome of your interactions. Vulnerability removes defensiveness, promotes empathy and bolsters creativity. Many associate vulnerability with weakness and push people away out of fear of rejection or ridicule. However, you can\u2019t experience wholeheartedness without it. \u201cThe Power of Vulnerability\u201d by Brene Brown is a great resource on guiding you on the power of vulnerability. She also has a wonderful Ted Talk. COPYRIGHT 2022",

The FDA is \u201cwarning consumers and health care professionals not to purchase or use Delsam Pharma\u2019s Artificial Eye Ointment due to potential bacterial contamination,\u201d the agency announced Tuesday. The ointment, which is manufactured by Global Pharma Healthcare Private Limited, is a lubricant used to prevent irritation and relieve dryness of the eye, according to a description on Delsam Pharma\u2019s website. The announcement comes three weeks after the agency issued a similar warning against two other Global Pharma products, artificial tears distributed by EzriCare and Delsam Pharma. \u201cUsing contaminated artificial tears increases (the) risk of eye infections that could result in blindness or death,\u201d the FDA said in a news release on Feb.2. \u201cPatients who have signs or symptoms of an eye infection should talk to their health care provider or seek medical care immediately,\u201d the agency added. All three products are manufactured by Global Pharma and sold over the counter. They are intended to be sterile. Global Pharma announced a voluntary recall of all unexpired lots of the artificial tears products shortly after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a health advisory over an outbreak of a \u201crare strain of extensively drug-resistant\u201d bacteria, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, associated with the use of the eye drops. The recall was recommended by the FDA due to the company\u2019s \u201ccurrent good manufacturing practice (CGMP) violations,\u201d which include the distribution of the drug in multi-use bottles without adequate preservatives, and the lack of appropriate microbial testing. As of Tuesday, the CDC had identified 58 patients in 13 states with infections that have been linked to the use of contaminated products. One person died due to a bloodstream infection, and five people reportedly lost their vision, according to a news release. EzriCare Artificial Tears was the brand most commonly reported.",

    "content": "A crowd of pro-Trump supporters storm the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer is warning against the release of security footage from during the Capitol attack to Fox News host Tucker Carlson. Samuel Corum/Getty Images hide caption A crowd of pro-Trump supporters storm the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer is warning against the release of security footage from during the Capitol attack to Fox News host Tucker Carlson. Democrats are sounding the alarm that a Fox News host's access to thousands of hours of security tapes from the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol could endanger the Capitol further and trigger a new wave of disinformation. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer called the release \"one of the worst security risks since 9/11\" in a letter to fellow senators Wednesday. He issued the warning following reporting by Axios that House Speaker Kevin McCarthy granted Fox News host Tucker Carlson access to more than 40,000 hours of the tapes. \"The footage Speaker McCarthy is making available to Fox News is a treasure trove of closely held information about how the Capitol complex is protected and its public release would compromise the safety of the Legislative Branch and allow those who want to commit another attack to learn how Congress is safeguarded,\" Schumer said. Carlson on his Monday night program said his team was reviewing the security footage. He has been a key figure in spreading false claims related to the siege , including incorrect claims that \"antifa\" groups or the FBI could be to blame for the attack . NPR has not independently confirmed Carlson's team has access to the footage. Both Fox News and McCarthy's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In the letter, Schumer said that the footage could reveal the location of security cameras, which could make it harder for U.S. Capitol Police to do their work. He also expressed concern that the video footage would expose \"highly-guarded plans for continuity of government.\" Earlier on Wednesday afternoon , House Democrats met virtually for a briefing on the matter, led in part by Mississippi Rep. Bennie Thompson, the former chair of the House Select Committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack, which completed its work in December. \"I'm not comfortable with the knowledge that I have right now that the security interests of the Capitol, the people who work there and the people who visit is protected,\" Thompson, now the ranking Democrat on the House Homeland Security panel, said. \"There are some items ... that should not be made available to the general public.\" Thompson went on to detail the painstaking process the select committee followed during its investigation to access the security footage, and his worries the same procedures aren't in place today. The Jan. 6 panel had a separate, password-protected computer set up for committee staff to review the security footage. Those staff members worked with Capitol Police to coordinate which clips the committee wanted to share as part of its hearings. \"So without any knowledge of how this release [to Carlson] was negotiated, it's a concern,\" Thompson said. Some moderate Republicans have argued in favor of more access to the tapes. \"Sunlight is the best medicine,\" tweeted South Carolina Rep. Nancy Mace. Not sure why both sides of the aisle wouldn\u2019t want every minute of the J6 video footage unfiltered, not redacted, for all to access. Every media outlet, every defense attorney, the public, etc. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Sunlight is the best medicine. U.S. Capitol Police had already shared the security footage with Congress, meaning top congressional leaders and committees can now access and share the tapes. \"When Congressional Leadership or Congressional Oversight Committees ask for things like this, we must give it to them,\" U.S. Capitol Police Chief Tom Manger said in a statement.",

    "content": "The pilot was flying around in a Piper PA-28-161, a similar one pictured, when the instructor had a fatal heart attack. aviation-images.com via Getty Images A pilot flew around northern England with his aviation instructor unknowingly dead beside him after the man suffered a fatal heart attack, which the pilot thought was him \u201cjust joking\u201d around, according to a newly released safety report. The pilot had just taken to the sky over Lancashire on June 29 when he said the 57-year-old senior flight instructor slumped over as if he were sleeping, according to the report by the Air Accidents Investigation Branch, which investigates civil aircraft accidents and incidents within the U.K. Advertisement The pilot, not identified in the report, said he had asked the instructor to accompany him for a single circuit around the Blackpool Airport. This request followed the pilot canceling initial plans to fly out of the airport solo after deciding that the crosswind was \u201cabove his personal limit to fly on his own.\u201d The instructor agreed, and the pair spoke normally as they taxied on the runway in the single-engine Piper PA-28-161. Shortly after takeoff, however, the pilot said the instructor\u2019s head rolled back, and he appeared to be pretending to nap. The pilot said he thought nothing was seriously wrong and continued flying. \u201cThe pilot knew the instructor well and thought he was just pretending to take a nap whilst the pilot flew the circuit, so he did not think anything was wrong at this stage,\u201d the report states. The pair continued to fly, and eventually, the man\u2019s head slumped onto his shoulder, but \u201cthe pilot still thought the instructor was just joking with him and continued to fly the approach,\u201d the report states. Advertisement It wasn\u2019t until after he landed that the pilot became concerned as the instructor was still not responding. He signaled an emergency crew to assist, but the man could not be revived. A later autopsy determined that the man, who had a history of high blood pressure and had been taking medication for his condition, had suffered a heart attack. \u201cPeople who had spoken to him on the morning of the incident said he was his normal cheerful self, and there were no indications that he was feeling unwell,\u201d the report states. It noted three people who flew with him before the incident \u201csaid he seemed well and nothing abnormal had occurred.\u201d A review of past aviation incident reports, dating back to 2005, found three confirmed incidents on board commercial aircraft in the U.K. where a pilot suffered a heart attack in flight \u201cbut on each occasion, the other pilot had been able to land the aircraft safely.\u201d In the Lancashire incident, the Air Accidents Investigation Branch credited the pilot for safely landing the plane, noting that \u201chad this occurred on another flight, the outcome could have been different.\u201d Advertisement Related world news england airplanes Downpour Kills At Least 36 In Brazil, Cities Cancel Carnival 2 Planes Narrowly Avoid Collision At Austin Airport, FAA Says Passenger's Video Captures Last Moments Before Nepal Crash Go To Homepage Before You Go Nina Golgowski Breaking News Reporter, HuffPost Suggest a correction You May Like",

    "content": "Emma Slater and Sasha Farber are going their separate ways. On Tuesday, the Dancing With the Stars pro filed for divorce from her husband of four years, court docs obtained by ET show. In the Los Angeles filing, Slater cites \"irreconcilable differences\" as the reason for the split, and requests that neither she nor Farber receive financial support after their divorce. Slater additionally says that she and Farber are having an \"uncontested divorce\" and \"intend on amicably resolving all property issues in a subsequent Stipulated Judgment of Dissolution of Marriage.\" ET has reached out to Slater and Farber for comment. The docs list April 1, 2022 as Slater and Farber's date of separation. Fans, however, learned of the pair's separation in August 2022, after the couple sparked split speculation when they stopped popping up on each other's Instagram pages. Slater and Farber got engaged live on DWTS in October 2016, when Farber popped the question after the pair performed a contemporary dance together. They went on to tie the knot in March 2018.
