[+] in the UEFA Euro 2020 Championship Final between Italy and England at Wembley Stadium on July 11, 2021 in London, England. (Photo by Andy Rain - Pool/Getty Images) Getty Images Teams hoping to win the World Cup not only have to beat their opponents, they need to beat the local climate and conditions. Games played at altitude, in soaring temperatures, or with huge distances between venues can make or break a team\u2019s tournament. At the 2014 World Cup, an energy-sapping encounter in Manaus, deep in the hot and humid Amazon basin, exhausted England and Italy\u2019s players, and was partially blamed for both countries\u2019 group-stage exits. Many of these challenges are caused simply by the diverse nature of our planet. But for the 2030 World Cup, FIFA has skewed the field for its own political reasons. Reports suggest that the 2030 World Cup will be hosted in Spain, Portugal and Morocco, but with the opening three matches played across the ocean in South America. Uruguay, Paraguay and Argentina had bid for the 2030 tournament, with a main focus of their bid being that it would be 100 years since the first World Cup in Uruguay, so it would be nice and sentimental to host the centenary event there too (despite most of the games being in neighboring Argentina). In some feat of sporting diplomacy, it seems the bulk of the 2030 tournament will now be played in Europe and North Africa, with the opening three games being played in Uruguay, Paraguay and Argentina to reflect this centenary year.

Local South Americans will be unlikely to get any tickets despite \u201chosting\u201d a World Cup, national team fans will have to add a transatlantic ticket to their World Cup expenses, and while Infantino says 2030 \u201cwill have a unique global footprint,\u201d it seems he hasn\u2019t considered the tournament\u2019s carbon footprint . The decision to host the opening three games in South America could also impact the sporting integrity of the tournament. Buenos Aires is more than 10,000 kilometers, or a 12-hour flight, from Madrid. That\u2019s more than double the distance between 2026 host cities Vancouver and Miami, and more than three times the distance between the two furthest apart cities at Russia 2018. While Madrid and Morocco could be in the middle of summer heatwaves during the World Cup, it will be winter in Buenos Aires with the daily mean temperature in June just 12 degrees Celsius (53 degrees Fahrenheit), and there is a six-hour time difference between Paraguay and Spain. The effect of travel on performance can be seen at Euro 2020 , which was held across Europe and had huge disparities between distances traveled, with some countries potentially traveling more than ten times further than others. Out of all the teams to reach the knockout stages, the two finalists, England and Italy, had the shortest total distance from their opening game to the final. Semi-finalists Denmark had the second shortest distance to travel up to the round of 16, where they won 4-0 against Wales, who had the fifth longest distance at that stage. The other semi-finalist, Spain, had the fifth shortest route to the final. And in the three-day turnaround between the quarterfinals and semifinals, the two losers of the semifinals had much longer journeys to London from Baku and Saint Petersburg. Correlation might not be causation, but there is certainly some correlation between the distances traveled and results during Euro 2020. Overcoming the local conditions is part of tournament soccer. As far back as the Mexico 1986 World Cup, England trained in steam rooms at altitude in Colorado to try to prepare for with the altitude of Mexico City and extreme heat of Monterrey. But depending on the fixture schedule, six teams at the 2030 World Cup could possibly have to travel an extra 10,000 miles more than their next opponents. They will also need to find two base camps, disrupting their tournament preparations. Whether it shows in the next game, or through accumulated fatigue as the tournament progresses, these kinds of factors can make the difference between winning and losing. Follow me on Twitter .

    "content": "People who seek help for mental health issues should be asked about problem gambling in the same way they are asked about drugs, smoking and alcohol, new guidance has suggested. According to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice), those who visit an NHS health professional in England for depression, anxiety or thoughts about self-harm or suicide due to a possible addiction, such as alcohol or drugs, could be at a greater risk of harm from gambling. Nice said questions should be asked about patients\u2019 gambling habits to ensure they can cope with their thoughts and urges. In new draft guidance, it suggested patients should be encouraged to assess the severity of their gambling by using a questionnaire available on the NHS website. Those who score eight or higher should seek support and treatment from gambling services. Health professionals should also discuss software blocking tools to limit online gambling and consider cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) as an option. NHS England has said about 1,400 people were referred for help for gambling addiction last year, up by a third on 2021. Prof Jonathan Benger, the chief medical officer and interim director of the centre for guidelines at Nice, said: \u201cHarmful gambling causes immense misery to all those who experience it. We want those needing help or who are at risk to be identified sooner and receive appropriate help.\u201d Since 2019, NHS England has opened 12 gambling treatment clinics, with a further three due to open in the coming months. It is planning to treat up to 3,000 people a year across the 15 facilities, as part of the NHS long-term plan. Benger added: \u201cThe independent committee who made these draft recommendations included both clinicians and people with personal experience of harmful gambling. They scrutinised all the available evidence to identify treatments and therapies that have been shown to work and offer good value for money. The result is this useful and usable advice to help NHS clinics as they develop their service.\u201d Fiona Macleod, the director of services at the charity GamCare, said the Nice guidance was \u201can important step\u201d. \u201cIdentifying an issue with gambling as early as possible is vital to prevent harm from occurring later down the line, and we know that there is an important role that healthcare professionals can play in helping more people find the support they need. \u201cWe believe these recommendations, if implemented, will present a greater opportunity to prevent gambling harms from occurring in the UK. They represent an important step in encouraging more people to seek support, through services such as those GamCare provides.\u201d Zo\u00eb Osmond, the chief executive of GambleAware, also welcomed the draft guidance. \u201cGambling harms are a serious public health issue, which can affect anyone, and healthcare professionals are ideally placed to identify and help people experiencing them,\u201d she said. \u201cWe welcome the development of guidelines to further inform treatment for those seriously affected by gambling harm and will be responding to the consultation with our views.\u201d The NHS England mental health director, Claire Murdoch, said: \u201cGambling addiction is a cruel disease that destroys people\u2019s lives, and the NHS is already playing its part in treating it with four new specialist clinics opening in recent months and a further three opening later this year, so if you\u2019re struggling, please come forward for help. \u201cWe will work with Nice on this consultation process and while this new guidance will ensure the NHS can help even more people struggling with gambling addiction to receive evidenced-based treatment, it is vital that the billion-pound industry also takes action in line with the government\u2019s white paper to stop people coming to harm in the first place.\u201d In April, the government outlined plans to reform gambling to ensure regulation meets new challenges as the \u201clandscape has changed significantly since 2005\u201d.

Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin The cricket World Cup starts on October 5 (Photo by Matthew Lewis-ICC/ICC via Getty Images) ICC via Getty Images The cricket World Cup starts on October 5 in the sport's rabid heartland. India which famously last hosted the event in 2011 when a MS Dhoni title-clinching six into a sea of ecstatic fans became instantly etched into lore. Even though T20s had been around for some time, with two T20 World Cups contested and the Indian Premier League exploding onto the scene in 2008, the most important prize was undoubtedly the World Cup of the 50-over variety. Back then there was no need to differentiate. The World Cup was the World Cup. The T20 equivalent was a little bit mickey mouse at the international level, still not taken seriously. But things have changed significantly in the last 12 years. The shorter three-hour format of T20 has grabbed the hearts of a younger generation, spawning lucrative domestic leagues globally, and proving a suitable game for this instant gratification era. Last year's T20 World Cup , marked by an epic India-Pakistan contest at a 90,000 MCG, felt like the tournament had really arrived. And the next event - just eight months away - might be a definitive moment for the sport with it being co-hosted by the U.S. Kohli inspired India to an amazing victory over arch-rivals Pakistan (Photo by Daniel ...

There has been much debate over the future of the 50-over format - which is played over around eight hours - and whether it should be significantly reduced or ditched entirely. As I reported recently, ODI's immediate future is secure with cricket's powerbrokers intent on protecting the format. ODIs still holds significant cache because of the 50-over World Cup, which is a money-spinner and remains the most coveted prize for players. It won't be going anywhere because there are World Cups in the next cycle of events in 2027 and 2031. For the next event, which will be played in South Africa, Zimbabwe and Namibia, the World Cup will finally expand from its measly number of 10 teams to 14. That means smaller cricket nations will need more exposure beforehand to ensure they are competitive for the next World Cup. But amid such a crammed calendar, with ODIs seemingly the casualty, there will be precious opportunities for them. With seemingly little appetite, despite administrators saying otherwise, the format is clearly on the nose, played less these days with little fanfare from fans. It's saddening for a previous generation when the 50-over format was the most exciting spectacle imaginable. ODI cricket once attracted packed crowds (Photo by Tony Marshall/EMPICS via Getty Images) PA Images via Getty Images There have already been reports from India that this cricket-mad country has been less enthused over the World Cup. Sports fever is currently centered over India's strong showing at the Asian Games - the world's second biggest multi-sport event being contested in Hangzhou, China. Inevitably, especially if hosts and favorites India start getting on a roll, the World Cup will ignite and it could lead to a swirl of nostalgia. Maybe fans will believe the format can offer the right balance of Test cricket's slow burn along with T20's manic approach. Or perhaps this will be something of a last dance, where the often excruciating middle overs makes everyone realise that the format is a relic. Either way, 50-over cricket will be the center of attention in the cricket world. Something that rarely happens these days. Follow me on Twitter .

File Photo: Commander, US President Joe Biden and US First Lady Jill Bidens German Shepherd, is ... [+] taken for a walk on the South Lawn before their return to the White House in Washington, DC. AFP via Getty Images Key Facts The First Lady\u2019s spokesperson said Commander \u201cis not presently on the White House campus while next steps are evaluated,\u201d the Associated Press reported . The spokesperson noted that the Bidens are \u201cgrateful for the patience and support\u201d of the Secret Service staffers and all other staffers as they attempt to \u201cwork through solutions.\u201d Last month, a tourist took a photo of Commander biting Dale Haney, the White House\u2019s chief groundskeeper and later that month the dog bit a Secret Service officer. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre commented on the photo of Commander biting Haney and said the dog and the chief groundskeeper were playing and no skin was broken at the time. What To Watch For It is unclear where the 2-year-old German shepherd is living currently and if there are plans to bring him back to the White House. The First Lady\u2019s spokesperson said the White House can be a \u201cstressful environment\u201d for pets and the family was working on \u201cways to help Commander handle the often unpredictable nature of the White House grounds.\u201d Key Background Aside from the two biting incidents reported last month, the 2-year-old German shepherd has bitten Secret Service personnel at least 10 other times , according to the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s records. The ten earlier biting incidents were recorded between October 2022 and January 2023, one of which required a hospital visit. It is unknown if any other biting incidents have taken place between January and September. Biden\u2019s older German Shepherd Major was also involved in several biting incidents, which eventually resulted in him moving out of the White House. Tangent CNN reported that Secret Service personnel at the White House had raised concerns about workplace safety over the biting incidents. One source cited by CNN referred to the work environment as \u201chostile\u201d and \u201cdangerous\u201d adding that agents are forced to avoid some entrances and routes inside the building to avoid getting bitten by Commander. Despite purportedly receiving assurances that the dog would receive appropriate training, the incidents continued to happen.

Sophomore wing Joseph Pinion led six Red players in double figures with a game-high 20 points (7-of-8 field goals, including 3-of-4 from 3, and 3-of-4 free throws) to go with 4 rebounds, 1 assist, 1 steal, and boxscore plus-13 in 27 minutes as his team broke a 41-all tie at halftime to topple the White, 88-70, in front of a hearty crowd of nearly 5,500 inside the venue that the men\u2019s and women\u2019s basketball teams called home through the 1992-93 season. Seven different Hogs hit three\u2019s as the teams combined for 14-of-28 shooting from distance (50%). \u201cFirst of all, the crowd was awesome,\u201d Head Hog Eric Musselman said after the game. \u201cIt was closer to 6,000 than 5,500. So the turnout when the weather\u2019s not great, and we\u2019re still a long way from playing a game. So I thought the crowd was awesome. \u201cI think the guys felt that, even pregame. A lot of things we need to clean up, we need to get better. But all things that we think are teachable. The shooting is obviously \u2026 We\u2019re going to be able to stretch the defense out a little bit more than maybe we have in the past. So really pleased with our shooting. Pretty pleased wit how the flow of the offense is. We\u2019re running an offense that we ran for about 10 games two years ago that\u2019s kind of what Milwaukee ran two years ago. And it requires a lot of thinking and a lot of reading and pretty happy with how far advanced the guys are with that. Obviously we\u2019ve got to get a lot, lot better. Some guys are further advanced on knowing this than others, but that\u2019ll hopefully come over time.\u201d Senior lead guard El Ellis had a strong floor game for the Red with his 16 points (8-10 field goals), game-high 6 assists, 1 steal, 1 turnover, and boxscore plus-17 in 28 minutes.

The Red team shot a blistering 37-of-54 from the field (68.5%), including 6-of-11 from 3 (54.5%), and 8-of-11 at the free throw line (72.7%). The Red dominated the glass (plus-10 at 27-17) and turnovers [plus-6 at 13-7, including plus-7 in steals at 10-3). The White team shot 26-of-47 from the field (55.3%), including 8-of-17 from 3 (47.1%), and 10-of-15 from the foul line (66.7%). It seemed unlikely that Brazile would play given what Musselman told the media following practice on Thursday, Sept. 28, which was Brazile (he\u2019s completing recovery on his injured knee that ended his season nearly a year ago in early December 2022) would likely begin competing in live, full-contact scrimmaging in \u201ctwo-and-a-half weeks.\u201d Indeed, Brazile was not included on either roster for the Red/White tilt. Musselman updated Brazile\u2019s status following the Red/White game. \u201cWith TB, we\u2019re being \u2014 like, I want TB in March,\u201d Musselman said. \u201cI mean, we want him to get his rhythm and all that. He\u2019s done an awesome job. He\u2019s been cleared. He\u2019s been with his rehab guy. They\u2019ve done all the testing. Everything is great. Probably could\u2019ve played tonight, three minutes a half, but why? \u201cWe want him to go a little more three-on-three. He\u2019s been going three-on-three live after we\u2019re done with practice. So, he\u2019ll go three-on-three live one more time this week at some point. But he\u2019s been jumping into all of our drills. Offensively, when a player is coming back from an injury like that, that\u2019s not really an issue. The issue is, \u2018I\u2019m guarding you or you or you and I got to react.\u2019 And so that\u2019s why we want to take our time. No real timeline other than we certainly \u2014 with the way it\u2019s going now, he\u2019s playing opening night.\u201d Junior guard Khalif Battle went through early pre-game warmups, but left the court appearing to favor his right foot. When he returned to the court, he was in street clothes and on crutches with his foot in a walking boot. Musselman also addressed Battle\u2019s injury status after the game. \u201cHe practiced today,\u201d Musselman said of Battle. \u201cI walked over and got in the gym and he said his foot was really sore. They took him for a preliminary look over at the football facility. At that point, nothing, there was no determination there was anything, no break or anything. But I know that they\u2019re going to look at it again tomorrow with some different X-rays or whatever. \u201cAs of now, no update, nothing other than the fact he felt uncomfortable. Not in the same spot where he had a break earlier. Same foot, but not really related as of now. But we did have more than one doctor look at him over at football. Then we had a couple more doctors in our locker room. So right now, nothing unless whatever tests they run, something comes up.\u201d My midnight in Fayetteville takeaways (2 parts) following Arkansas' Red/White Showcase on Wed @ Barnhill Arena -Rain falling outside, Hogs raining 3's inside -Players who stood out -Injury updates -Key recruiting updates, incl '24 Hog target announcing on Thurs More Arkansas Razorbacks R/W gm highlights from Barnhill -Makhi Mitchell drives left for window finish (reel 1) -Jeremiah Davenport drives paint for runner (reel 2) -Joseph Pinion dials up his 3rd triple (reel 3) -Davenport w/lightning-fast release on C&S corner 3 (reel 4) More Arkansas Razorbacks R/W gm highlights from Barnhill Arena on Wed \u2026 -Chandler Lawson wing middy (reel 1) -El Ellis drains corner Jnin transition (reel 2) -Devo & Lawson w/brilliant give-&-go in transition (reel 3) -Denijay Harris smash-cashes in 1 of his 5 stls (reel 4) One of the strengths of senior big man Makhi Mitchell's game is his roll to the cup after setting a pick \u2026 nice 2-man game here as sophomore G Keyon Menifield, Jr. fitted in a dime to set up Khi's finish \u2026 from R/W game @ Barnhill Arena on Wed \u2026 Arkansas senior forward Chandler Lawson was solid, finishing w/dbl-dbl (13p, 10r, 2b, 1s) in the Red win \u2026 Lawson's length, instincts tracking down rbs & battling for 50/50-balls in the paint, & competent face-up shooting look top-rotation worthy \u2026 Arkansas guard Devo Davis was givin' junior wing Tramon Mark the business on D \u2026 until \u2026 well, Mark hit the gas & snow-coned the finish off the window for the White team \u2026 This \u2026 is \u2026 Arkansas sophomore wing \u2026 JOSEPH PINION !!!

    "content": "Darren Kellenschwiler\u2019s long BSV blockchain history runs from the tumultuous days of the BCH-BSV split to his current role as a technical lead at the . On this week\u2019s , Darren takes a trip down memory lane with Charles Miller, recalling the end of 2018 when he hosted Bitcoin meetups in London. It was during this period that the BCH and BSV split occurred, resulting in heated debates and ideological divisions within the community. Darren recalled the atmosphere, when \u201ceverything was a little tumultuous, and people were taking different ideological stances. There were very strong arguments\u2014over a beer! That\u2019s the sort of atmosphere at that time. It was the hash wars era.\u201d Darren was on the BSV blockchain side of the divide, firmly believing in Dr. Craig Wright as the inventor of . As he explained, \u201cI had made my mind up years before that this chap, Dr Wright is the inventor of Bitcoin. So I didn\u2019t really waste my time with the crowd that were somehow rebelling against him.\u201d As BSV blockchain emerged, Darren took \u201ca leap of faith\u201d despite the ongoing debates about Dr. Craig Wright. As he says, \u201cThere wasn\u2019t a lot of public detail with respect to the evidence for Dr. Craig Wright having invented Bitcoin.\u201d This period also marked the birth of the \u201cBitcoin protocol is set in stone\u201d campaign. One of Darren\u2019s notable contributions to the BSV blockchain community was , an email application integrated with micropayments. He explained his motivation behind it: \u201cI don\u2019t like spam. I hate reading emails that are not relevant to me. So I thought, attach some value to it. We\u2019ll create \u2018inbox economics,\u2019 where the highest in the inbox is the person who paid you the most for you to read it.\u201d While Baemail gained quick adoption within the BSV blockchain community, it faced challenges in achieving widespread usage due to limitations in BSV wallet adoption. Darren\u2019s journey continued when he met Brendan Lee from at a conference in London. Brendan bought Baemail and hired Darren, making him a co-founder of the company. Together, they delved into building Metanet applications and experimenting with hosting entire websites on the Metanet, a concept that was both groundbreaking and esoteric at the time. Today, Darren serves as the technical lead of the utilization value stream at the BSV Blockchain Association. He described his role as multifaceted, involving contributions to various aspects of the BSV blockchain ecosystem. He also emphasized the Association\u2019s responsibility to ensure that the user experience and businesses built on BSV blockchain remain intact and thrive. Darren also highlighted his passion for tackling complex challenges and his role in documenting, analyzing, and improving wallet architectures within the BSV blockchain ecosystem. He mentioned the importance of effective communication and collaboration with developers, including discussions with Dr. Craig Wright, to advance the ecosystem\u2019s growth and development. Darren Kellenschwiler\u2019s journey in the BSV blockchain ecosystem exemplifies the resilience and dedication of individuals committed to the vision of a stable, scalable, and innovative blockchain. As BSV blockchain continues to evolve, Darren and others like him play a pivotal role in shaping its future.",

    "description": "Political scientist Theda Skocpol on how tea party politics laid the foundation for the GOP\u2019s current troubles.",
    "content": "In the hours after the House of Representatives\u2019 historic vote to oust Kevin McCarthy from the speakership, a photo began circulating online of the cover of Young Guns , the splashy policy treatise authored by then-Reps. Eric Cantor, Paul Ryan and Kevin McCarthy in 2010. The irony of the photo was clear enough: The book, which featured a gleaming group portrait of the three self-declared standard-bearers of the Republican Party, was intended to introduce the rising stars of the GOP to the American people \u2014 but now, just 13 years after its publication, the book had become a visual obituary for the party\u2019s past. When I called Theda Skocpol \u2014 a political scientist at Harvard University who\u2019s written extensively about the rise of the tea party and the transformation of the Republican Party \u2014 shortly after the House kicked McCarthy out of the speakership, she was staring at this same photo. \u201cI\u2019m sitting here looking at a picture on my iPad of the three \u2018Young Guns\u2019 from that iconic cover of their book,\u201d she said. \u201cAll three of them were felled in succession by the popular anger of the tea party base.\u201d The tea party that Skocpol was referring to no longer formally exists as a faction in Congress, its erstwhile allies having been subsumed into the far-right Freedom Caucus or into the generic \u201cAmerica First\u201d wing of the GOP. But according to Skocpol, the history of the tea party remains essential to understanding the forces that ultimately led to McCarthy\u2019s political demise. \u201cIt represents the culmination of [the tea party movement],\u201d said Skocpol. \u201cAll the research that I and other political scientists have done on the movement shows that by the 2010s \u2014 just before Donald Trump emerges \u2014 the tea party had taken the shape of a just-say-no, blow-it-all-up, don\u2019t-cooperate, do-politics-on-Twitter faction \u2014 and this is the perfect expression of it. This is where it leads.\u201d In some respects, Skocpol\u2019s argument is counterintuitive. In the late 2000s and early 2010s, McCarthy and the other Young Guns rose to power by harnessing the grassroots power of the tea party movement, promising to slash government spending, constrain federal power and foil the Obama administration\u2019s policy goals. But though McCarthy and the other Young Guns rose to prominence by allying themselves with the tea party movement, Skocpol said, their banishment from the GOP doesn\u2019t mark a break with the movement\u2019s legacy. Instead, it shows that the Young Guns never really understood the forces that they helped unleash. \u201cThe fact that McCarthy and the other Young Guns were once called tea party people because they dallied with the movement,\u201d Skocpol said, \u201cdoes not mean that the tiger wasn\u2019t going to consume them in the end.\u201d The following has been edited for clarity and concision. Ian Ward: You\u2019ve written extensively about the history of the tea party movement and its aftereffects for the Republican Party. How does the vote to oust Speaker McCarthy fit into that history? Theda Skocpol: Shortly into Barack Obama\u2019s presidency, we saw this explosion of tea party demonstrations and a remarkable degree of grassroots organizing \u2014 a couple thousand local tea parties, according to our research. There was a lot of writing at the time claiming that this organization was motivated by the same thing that people now claim drives the Republican Party when they shut down the government \u2014 cutting the deficit. But it was never about cutting the deficit. The popular side of the tea party was about anger and fear of a changing country in which a guy with \u2018Hussein\u2019 as his middle name and black skin could be elected president. The tea party \u2014 especially at the grassroots \u2014 was trying to pressure the Republican Party and its elected leaders not to compromise with a changing country or with Democratic Party politicians in Washington. Ward: How did the Young Guns fit into that mobilization? Skocpol: The tea party mobilization made a big difference electorally in 2010 in installing a Republican Congress, and probably even more importantly in installing Republican-dominated state legislatures. But it was especially potent after that in undoing any effort at compromise over immigration. Our research shows that polarization over immigration between the two major parties has played out recently and piled on top of the polarization over the civil rights revolution of the 1960s. By the time you get to the period at the end of Barack Obama\u2019s presidency, he\u2019s trying to find a way to incorporate long-present immigrants from Mexico and Central America and give them a path to citizenship \u2014 and that effort falls apart in 2013 and 2014. Remember that election in which David Brat in central Virginia shockingly felled Eric Cantor, who at that time was seen as the kind of rising golden boy on the Republican right? It was anger over the potential of immigration reform that played a big role in that. And then you have Paul Ryan, who inherited a Congress where the Republican caucus was increasingly riven by the rise of this angry, just-say-no style that the tea party always favored. They wanted to make sure that people were angry about changes in the country and wanted to make sure Republicans were not compromising about those. Paul Ryan was [from] Mr. Koch\u2019s network. I think that House Republicans thought that by making him their leader, they would cement their right-wing Republican credentials\u2014 and it did with the elites around the Republican Party at the time. But among the populist right \u2014 who make up more than half of Republican base voters and the most loyal primary voters \u2014they never liked what he had to offer. So he was gone before long. And now finally, we get to Kevin McCarthy, who is just an example of the final transmogrification of the tea party anger, which was given a national focus and much more potency by Donald Trump. Donald Trump didn\u2019t create all this. He\u2019s just been very good, ever since 2015, at giving it permission and focus. Ward: McCarthy and the other Young Guns who rose to power during that tea party moment in the late 2000s and early 2010s gave voice to one interpretation of the tea party movement that you mentioned, which is that it was all about fiscal conservatism and small government. Why do you think they so dramatically misunderstood the energies behind the movement? Skocpol: We have to understand the radicalization of the Republican Party as a process that has been underway since 2000. Act 1 of that radicalization was the rise of the Koch network, which was itself motivated by displeasure with what the Republicans under Bush junior and senior had been doing \u2014 for example, passing Medicare expenditures. The Koch network outflanked the Republican Party, and they put a lot of pressure on candidates and officeholders to hew the line on cutting taxes, cutting regulations and disabling public sector unions. These Young Guns were initially in tune with that \u2014 and why wouldn\u2019t they be? They thought that\u2019s where the money came from and where the business community had gone. But that wasn\u2019t satisfactory to a lot of base voters around the Republican Party, who were much angrier about social changes in the country and much more upset about immigration. So I think the Republican Party was first hollowed out at the top, and then the tea party crystallized when Barack Obama was elected president and then it ended up being given further expression during the immigration reform battles and the rise of Donald Trump. I call it the bottom-up radicalization of the Republican Party, and I think it caught a lot of these Koch network darlings, including all three of these Young Guns, by surprise \u2014 although in McCarthy\u2019s case, I think he has done his best to ride the tiger. He\u2019s tried to have it both ways. Ward: Why do you think McCarthy was able to ride that tiger for longer than the other two? Skocpol: He\u2019s a shapeshifter, and that\u2019s given him staying power \u2014 up until the moment he had Democratic votes to keep the government open and then went on TV over the weekend and trashed the Democrats. The shape shifting is both a strength and a weakness. It\u2019s a strength in that, a little bit more effectively than Paul Ryan before him, he\u2019s been able to have it both ways \u2014 to condemn Donald Trump and then embrace him, to say he\u2019s about cutting the deficit and he\u2019s about cracking down on the border. If the Republican Party really had wings \u2014 and I don\u2019t think it does at this point \u2014 he might have been able to bridge them. But by the end, he got to the point where nobody trusted him. I don\u2019t think anybody in the Republican Party trusted his word, and Democrats definitely couldn\u2019t. Ward: Given the fact that McCarthy rose to power during the tea party moment, is there any sense in which his ouster represents a repudiation of the tea party legacy? Skocpol: No \u2014 it represents the culmination of it. I think most people in the in the media thought the tea party was about cutting the federal budget deficit because that\u2019s what a few elite spokesmen on TV said it was about. But our research always showed that at the grassroots, it was about popular anger over a changing country and fury at a Republican Party that was not responding to that desire. All the research that I and other political scientists have done on the movement shows that by the 2010s, just before Donald Trump emerges, the tea party had taken the shape of a just-say-no, blow-it-all-up, don\u2019t-cooperate, do-politics-on-Twitter faction \u2014 and this is the perfect expression of it. This is where it leads. The fact that McCarthy and the other Young Guns were once called tea party people because they dallied with the movement does not mean that the tiger wasn\u2019t going to consume them in the end. Ward: The conflict between the tea party and the Obama-era Republican Party reflected some real ideological differences between those two factions, especially on issues like immigration. Do you think the conflict between the far-right, anti-McCarthy wing of the party and McCarthy\u2019s backers reflects a similarly robust ideological fissure? Or does it just boil down to rank obstructionism? Skocpol : I think it\u2019s post-ideological. One of the things that Trump\u2019s presidency accomplished was to give national expression to populist ethno-nationalism and anger at \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d in Washington, D.C, and you get to a certain point where there aren\u2019t many moderates at all in the Republican House caucus. There certainly are some people who are cross pressured because they come from Biden districts, but most of them have been enthusiastic supporters of the same kinds of issues that Matt Gaetz is speaking to. This is a disagreement over whether you should ever settle for less than 100 percent of what you want, even when you\u2019re in a position where you don\u2019t control more than one chamber. Ward: So if the conflict is essentially about tactics and the real energies behind the far right are cultural, why do people like Gaetz still lean so heavily on the language of fiscal conservatism? After all, this most recent incident was partly set off by McCarthy\u2019s unwillingness or inability to slash spending levels. Skocpol: You\u2019re not going to like the answer I\u2019m going to give you. Ward: Try me. Skocpol: It sells with the Washington press corps. Why anybody believes this is beyond me. Did you see what Donald Trump did when he was office? Did you see what Republicans did when they controlled the entire Congress? They don\u2019t cut anything, except taxes. And that keeps a certain number of billionaires \u2014 and even Charles Koch himself \u2014 happy. There are two strands that have played out in the Republican Party during recent years. One of them I call \u201cMcConnellism.\u201d McConnellism is clever. It\u2019s about using every lever of power to make sure Republicans get the federal judiciary full of judges who are going to disempower Democratic initiatives, and it\u2019s about doing everything you can to shape the electorate, both by encouraging your own voters and discouraging the other guys\u2019 voters. It\u2019s at the edge of what\u2019s legally and constitutionally legitimate. Then there\u2019s Trumpism, which at this point has gone from bullying and threatening to actual calls for violence. One of them is very powerful in the House, and the other is very powerful in the Senate. But it\u2019s a tactical difference. It\u2019s not as if there\u2019s a huge difference of policy. I think there might be some differences in policy over immigration, but those don\u2019t really come up because nobody\u2019s talking about legislating on immigration. Ward: So what does all this mean for the future of the Republican Party? What are the ramifications of the argument that you\u2019re making \u2014 that there\u2019s a fundamental continuity between the tea party movement and the MAGA movement? Skocpol: Well, everything depends on whether Donald Trump is reelected president, and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s impossible. I really don\u2019t. As for the House of Representatives, I really do not know how they\u2019re going to find a new Kevin McCarthy who can promise enough because the promises that are being demanded are impossible to fulfill. Ward: Based on the traditional tea party playbook, though, what do you think the endgame here is for the far-right faction in the House? Skocpol: Well, I think Matt Gaetz himself wants to get on TV, raise a lot of money and run for another office. That\u2019s true of a number of the people who make up this very small group of people who were in a position to pull the hook on the grenade. But I don\u2019t think we know how this is going to come out. If you\u2019ve got people in power who are backed by a large number of voters who are angry, fearful, limited in the information they get about what\u2019s going on and thinking that it would be better to blow America up than to save it \u2014 I think you\u2019re in uncharted territory. We are in uncharted territory.",

The 2024 presidential hopeful, who is polling second behind former President Donald Trump in the race for the Republican nomination, promises an energy policy to benefit \u201cMidland over Moscow,\u201d \u201cThe Marcellus over the Mullahs,\u201d and \u201cthe Bakken over Beijing.\u201d An all-of-the-above energy plan makes sense for a country as rich in natural resources as the United States, but there\u2019s always the risk of national campaigns to throw the baby out with the bathwater. \u201cThe self-imposed handcuffs on oil, gas, and critical minerals extraction will be removed,\u201d DeSantis said at a late-September campaign event in Midland, Texas, the heart of the Permian Basin, the nation\u2019s largest oil-producing basin. To remove those handcuffs, DeSantis wants to unwind the United State\u2019s current climate commitments, including withdrawing from the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement. Former President Donald Trump exited the Paris Agreement in 2017, a decision incoming President Joe Biden reversed on his first day in the Oval Office.

I believe the Biden administration has overreached in advancing a rapid transition to an all-electric economy, but not every policy decision is wrong. Correcting course will require a deft hand that can keep what works while ensuring that American families and businesses have access to abundant and affordable energy. The next administration should conduct a full review of the current policies to ensure that abundance, affordability, and American-produced are at the top of the to-do list. In addition to pulling out of the Paris deal, DeSantis says he would walk back the 2021 Global Methane Pledge to slash emissions globally by at least 30% by 2030 from 2020 levels and strike environmental, social, and governance (ESG) disclosure requirements that have tempered investors\u2019 confidence in traditional energy stocks despite the industry paying record dividends. The domestic oil and gas industry is committed to reducing emissions and minimizing the environmental impact of its activities, so eliminating artificial barriers to investment and access to capital, as the ESG trend has done, is a good start toward achieving our universal environmental goals. Like Trump\u2019s \u201cMaking America Energy Independent Again\u201d agenda , DeSantis leans heavily on pledges to rip up the Biden administration\u2019s policies favoring climate change over energy security and economic growth, including reversing restrictions to oil and gas production on public lands. Energy abundance and affordability should be our highest goals. A wealthy nation is far better positioned to address the challenges of a changing climate than a poor one. DeSantis promises to \u201cexpand federal lease sales and devolve more leasing authority to the states.\u201d The Biden administration has largely constrained new leasing to court-ordered sales or those prescribed in last year\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act. The administration recently canceled leases in Alaska\u2019s National Petroleum Reserve (NPR\u2013A), frustrating the industry and Republicans on Capitol Hill, and released a five-year offshore leasing plan that made no one happy. DeSantis is pledging to refill the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR), which Biden tapped before the 2020 election to tame rising gas prices \u2013 another example of politics interfering with public policy decisions. DeSantis says he would only use the nation\u2019s emergency oil reserve \u2013 the SPR is at its lowest level since the early 1980s \u2013 for actual supply disruptions. Given the geopolitical situation in Europe and the revanchment of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its Russian ally, to say nothing of the rise of China, maintaining robust reserves makes sense. DeSantis promises to revitalize America\u2019s nuclear and automobile industries. DeSantis would repeal Biden\u2019s electric vehicle (EVs) mandates and \u201csupport Americans\u2019 right to drive the cars they want.\u201d That doesn\u2019t mean he opposes EVs, but he believes they must be able to compete in the marketplace without government subsidies. DeSantis says he plans to jumpstart critical mineral mining on federal lands and create a strategic reserve of critical minerals to ensure America can compete in the energy transition with China, which controls 90% of the world's critical minerals. Streamlining environmental reviews and permitting is another priority for the Florida governor, as is preventing \u201cabusive litigation\u201d by environmental groups that have used the courts to block projects like the Dakota Access and Keystone XL pipelines by filing frivolous lawsuits. New rules targeting natural gas stoves, furnaces, and appliances would be repealed under DeSantis, giving Americans greater choice in how they want to cook and heat their homes. Such nanny state laws should be repealed wherever they are found because they create hurdles for competition and innovation in the marketplace. DeSantis likewise promises to repeal Biden\u2019s Clean Energy Plan , which demands a 90% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2035-2040 from power plants \u2013 essentially forcing a switch to renewable energy sources like wind and solar despite cost considerations. The country might be better served by a more modest goal that's attainable and doesn't scare off investment in the energy resources we need today \u2013 and will need for decades to come. The boldest \u2013 and most controversial \u2013 part of DeSantis\u2019 agenda is his promise of $2 per gallon retail gasoline prices by 2025, requiring pump prices to fall by about $1.85 from the current national average. That would require a crude oil price of about $55 a barrel, which could hurt U.S. crude oil production by putting too many new prospects below breakeven cost levels for new wells. U.S. refiners may also lack the capacity to deliver gasoline at that price level. Indeed, gasoline prices haven\u2019t touched the $2 a gallon level since the depths of the pandemic in 2020, when fuel demand collapsed under the weight of government-mandated lockdowns. Such a sharp price drop would also require cooperation from the OPEC cartel, whose member states are cutting supply to boost prices above $100 a barrel. The fix is literally in to keep pump prices high. Our only hope for seeing those prices fall is to increase domestic production. That won't happen overnight, but we have the resources; we just need the will. Overall, though, the feeling among American energy executives is that DeSantis is taking positive positions for national security and traditional energy producers. He prioritizes fossil fuel production, removing regulatory red tape and keeping the government out of industry decision-making over the pace and trajectory of the low-carbon transition. DeSantis\u2019 energy priorities reflect his concerns about the impact of energy cost inflation on Americans today rather than positioning the United States as a global leader in the fight against climate change. But he's also looking to take advantage of the economic and jobs opportunities offered by the diversification of the energy sector, focusing on critical minerals mining and a strategic reserve for these strategic resources.

    "description": "The exclusives Microsoft released for Xbox Series X/S this year have made 2023 feel like what 2020 should have felt like.",
    "content": "Even though we\u2019re almost three years into the life span of the Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S , it feels like this console generation is just starting for Microsoft. It\u2019s no secret that Xbox was slow to start up and then maintain consistency this console generation. For example, 2020 saw the company putting out a weak console launch lineup made up of ports and remasters. While 2021 had a flurry of great games, it was followed by a comparatively barren 2022. And 2023 hasn\u2019t been perfect either (due, in large part, to the flop that is Redfall ) , but outside of that, this year delivered the excellent Hi-Fi Rush , the grandly scaled Starfield , solid ports of two Age of Empires games and Quake II , a new Minecraft title, and a technical showpiece in Forza Motorsport . Recommended Videos Looking at that varied lineup, these games showcase both the potential of the Series X and the power of Xbox as a brand. Prospects for Xbox\u2019s lineup are up heading into 2024 too, so it feels like we\u2019re at the proper start of the Xbox Series X and S console generation \u2026 even if it came a few years too late. Related Baldur\u2019s Gate 3 drops Series S splitscreen support to release on Xbox in 2023 Xbox Games Showcase and Starfield Direct: how to watch and what to expect How many games featured in Xbox\u2019s 2022 showcase actually launched within 12 months? A new beginning Looking at the 2020 launch lineup for Xbox Series X/S, it wasn\u2019t exactly emblematic of what the console could do. While there were some nice 4K and 60 frames per second (fps) upgrades for Xbox One games, the only new draws were a console port of Gears Tactics , the multiplayer-supporting Tetris Effect: Connected , a temporary next-gen exclusive version of Yakuza: Like a Dragon , and some smaller indies like The Falconeer and Bright Memory 1.0 . Xbox Game Studios Most of those games were on or came to more platforms afterward and, in general, didn\u2019t provide that strong of an argument for why players should stick around this console generation. But looking at many of the games Xbox has released this year, it finally feels like we have a bundle of good Xbox exclusives that show what the platform was always capable of. In my review of Forza Motorsport , I note that the game feels like a launch title because it\u2019s an impressive technical showpiece. It runs at 4K and 60 fps in performance mode, which is something not many games this generation have done. The closest comparable games are Astro\u2019s Playroom and Marvel\u2019s Spider-Man Remastered on PlayStation 5, which effectively demonstrated the power of Sony\u2019s console early on. Forza Motorsport was also built as a platform that developer Turn 10 Studios can expand over time. It plans to periodically slot in new single and multiplayer content, including new cars and tracks. A game like that makes a lot of sense early on in a console\u2019s life span in this live-service era. It\u2019s what Microsoft tried to do with Halo Infinite , even if that didn\u2019t pan out as expected due to a one-year delay, and with Killer Instinct on Xbox One. Xbox Game Studios Then there\u2019s the matter of games that intrinsically feel next-gen in scope. While that\u2019s a much more nebulous feeling from person to person, the scale of a game like Starfield feels like something that wouldn\u2019t have worked or run as well on an Xbox One. It\u2019s a landmark, zeitgeisty first-party release that got the whole video game industry talking, which is something that Xbox has only managed to do a few times over the past decade and could have sorely used at the start of this console generation. On top of that, you\u2019ve got Hi-Fi Rush and Minecraft Legends as 2023 stand-ins for the typical quirkier launch titles, in line with games like Sackboy: A Big Adventure or Ryse: Son of Rome . The Age of Empires ports show unification between the PC and console publishing departments of Xbox. And it\u2019s also been a solid year for day-one Xbox Game Pass titles, with third-party games like Exoprimal and Lies of P hitting the subscription on launch day . It\u2019s perhaps the first time in nearly a decade that Xbox has seemed healthy on both the first-party and third-party fronts. Xbox Game Studios While it\u2019s impossible to say that Xbox has fully gotten its mojo back or that this is a definitive end to Microsoft\u2019s struggles, 2023 is still the first year where it has genuinely felt like the Series X vision is coming into focus. We\u2019ve gotten a comprehensive game lineup and reason to have faith in the viability of the future game lineup thanks to a packed summer showcase this June. It feels like a console launch year for Xbox. While that is a bit concerning as we\u2019re three years into these consoles\u2019 life spans, it hopefully is a sign that things will be better going forward, with Xbox truly rebounding after the lows of 2022 and Redfall . So, what does this feeling mean for players? For Xbox Series X and S owners, we finally are getting a sense of consistency and validation for the hardware we picked up, in some cases, almost three years ago. For those who don\u2019t own an Xbox system, it\u2019ll feel like the generation just started if you pick one up now and immediately download Forza Motorsport, Starfield , and Hi-Fi Rush . Editors' Recommendations You don\u2019t need an Xbox Series X to play Starfield.

    "description": "A new study finds an esketamine nasal spray achieved remission and prevented relapse of depression in patients with treatment-resistant depression.",
    "content": "A new study is offering more evidence in support of the former party drug in helping hard-to-treat depression. Depression is a , but an erstwhile party drug is projected to flip the narrative and improve the lives of those in desperate need. Over the last several years, \u2014 especially forms impervious to conventional treatment, known as treatment-resistant depression \u2014 by rewiring the brain, encouraging a phenomenon known as neuroplasticity. Currently, ketamine is only approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as an anesthetic; it isn\u2019t approved to treat any mental health conditions. But it\u2019s seeing off-label use in clinics offering intravenous infusions (often at a ), , and more recently, through nasal sprays. In 2019, the , an intranasal nasal spray containing esketamine, a molecule derived from the drug, based on clinical trials demonstrating its potency in not only treating but keeping treatment-resistant depression at bay. Now, a new study is offering more evidence in support of esketamine, positioning the nasal spray as even more effective than antidepressant medications like quetiapine, also known as Seroquel. In a clinical trial spanning 24 countries, among 336 participants already on an antidepressant, 28 percent saw remission of their symptoms after eight weeks on the esketamine nasal spray versus 18 percent of a similar-sized group taking quetiapine in addition to their usual antidepressants. After about 32 weeks, 22 percent of the esketamine remained in remission as opposed to 14 percent in the quetiapine group. Medical experts say these results are promising for patients with treatment-resistant depression, but more research is needed to see how truly effective the esketamine nasal spray is compared to other antidepressants \u2014 not just quetiapine \u2014 and whether the former party drug is safe for patients to take long-term. The in the . Lasting remission While a majority of individuals with depression will get better with conventional antidepressant medications, 10 to 30 percent don\u2019t respond to treatment at all. called the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (or STAR*D) study, those getting treatment for depression will generally enter remission (or return to normal levels of functioning) in a step-wise fashion: 30 percent after the first treatment, 50 percent after two treatments, 60 percent after three, and 70 percent after four. Studies show esketamine does seem to work pretty well when compared against a placebo for individuals with hard-to-treat depression, , director of the Center for Affective Disorders at King\u2019s College London, who co-led the study, tells . However, there hasn\u2019t been much data on how the esketamine nasal spray stacks up against other recognized, more affordable treatment options like quetiapine. Typically, ketamine is delivered as an intravenous infusion. To suss out how well it works against other treatments, 676 adults between 18 and 74 were recruited and screened from August 2020 to November 2021 across 24 countries. These were individuals with treatment-resistant depression already on an antidepressant \u2014 either a selective serotonin or serotonin-norepinephrine inhibitor. Participants were randomly put into two groups, but knew what they were getting: the esketamine sprayed up the nose twice a week in a health care setting or quetiapine taken daily. \u201cA very important thing of this study was to look at not only the people who got better but also stayed better over the course of 32 weeks,\u201d says Young. And that\u2019s what the researchers saw. After eight weeks of treatment, 28 percent of the esketamine group saw remission of their treatment-resistant depression, and 24 weeks after the initial treatment, 22 percent didn\u2019t relapse. (Whether someone was functioning back to normal was determined by the Montgomery-\u00c5sberg Depression Rating Scale, a 10-item clinician-rated scale used to assess the severity of depressive symptoms in those with mood disorders.) This is compared to 18 percent in the quetiapine group, 14 percent of whom didn\u2019t relapse after the same time period. Therapeutic potential with many questions , chief of psychiatry at Massachusetts General Hospital, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study, told in an email that the findings were in line with what many clinicians have come to expect with the efficacy of nasal esketamine for people with treatment-resistant depression. However, because the study was limited to comparing esketamine to quetiapine, it\u2019s hard to say how much better the nasal spray is compared to other drugs used for treatment-resistant depression. For , professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, who was also not involved in the study, there are concerns about how much the placebo effect may be at play during the course of the entire clinical trial, given participants knew what they were getting and the fact esketamine can only be administered in-person by a health care professional. \u201cThere\u2019s a big placebo effect of giving that much attention to a patient,\u201d he tells . He also mentions other factors at play, separate from the placebo effect. \u201cPeople get a little bit of high when they get [the esketamine nasal spray].\u201d While giving short-term doses of esketamine appears to be safe for patients, Anand says there\u2019s the issue of potential addiction associated with esketamine with prolonged use, which needs to be further investigated. Right now, it\u2019s not entirely clear how long esketamine can keep depressive symptoms at bay. Young says when treating severe or recurrent depression with conventional antidepressants, a patient would need to remain on medication for about six months although this can be as long as two years. He believes this could be the same for nasal esketamine. Like ketamine infusions, esketamine nasal sprays aren\u2019t cheap, but they may be more cost-effective, . As millions of people around the world suffer from depression, the hope remains for esketamine to revolutionize the way we approach mental health care.",

    "content": "A toxic cocktail of damaging chemicals created by road pollution is flowing into England\u2019s rivers and no regulator is monitoring the scale of its impact on wildlife or public health. More than 18,000 outfalls, such as pipes, and about 7,700 soakaways managed by National Highways discharge rainwater potentially contaminated with heavy metals, hydrocarbons, microplastics and other chemicals from the main road network into rivers and on to land. Last month, National Highways reported it had assessed its discharge points and found 1,236 outfalls and soakaways had \u201ca potential high risk of pollution\u201d. Of these, \u201c145 have a verified high risk of pollution and require mitigation\u201d while the remaining 1,091 had a \u201cpotential high risk\u201d of \u201cpolluting the water environment\u201d. runoff map Analysis by the Guardian and Watershed Investigations of hundreds of these sites reveals that about 70 are located in areas that are legally protected for important habitats or wildlife, and about 250 are within 1km (0.6 miles) of a protected site. Hundreds more discharge to rivers and land with no formal protection. Despite urban and transport pollution accounting for 18% of England\u2019s water bodies failing to meet good ecological standards, highways outfalls are not regulated under environmental permitting regulations, which means there is less scrutiny and no monitoring in place. Guy Linley-Adams, a solicitor at the charity Wildfish, said: \u201cThe Environment Agency has the power to bring highways drains and discharges under environmental permitting if they involve \u2018the discharge or entry to inland freshwaters, coastal waters or relevant territorial waters of any \u2026 poisonous, noxious or polluting matter\u2019. \u201cThat would certainly appear to be the case here, so the agency must show that it has considered the problem and explain why it has not yet, to our knowledge, required permits that limit pollution of rivers from, at the very least, the higher risk discharges that have been identified by National Highways. \u201cIt is no good just saying: \u2018We don\u2019t know how big this problem is.\u2019 Put simply, the agency has a duty to find out.\u201d National Highways said it did not routinely monitor runoff because the results varied depending on rainfall and river flows, and because it would not be practical or good value. It had instead developed a predictive tool to determine scenarios where the risk of impacts on water quality were unacceptably high. The lack of monitoring makes it impossible to understand the scale of the pollution but it is also hampered by lack of knowledge over the total number of outfalls across the country. Jo Bradley, a former Environment Agency officer who runs the Stormwater Shepherds not-for-profit, said: \u201cNational Highways operates 3% of the road network and they have over 25,000 outfalls and soakaways. Imagine how many there are across the entire road network. The number of these outfalls dwarfs the 15,000 storm sewer overflows, and perhaps the impact of the pollution is worse.\u201d Ten potentially high-risk outfalls drain runoff from the M27 bridge into the River Hamble conservation area, which flows into the Solent. Some of England\u2019s rare and fragile chalk streams are also under threat from runoff; the M1 discharges into the River Colne, near Watford, and runoff from the M3 flows into the River Itchen, in Hampshire, which is home to salmon, brown trout, grayling and otters. A cluster of 24 outfalls surround the River Kennet chalk stream area and its tributaries near Reading. Official data shows the river system has high levels of heavy metals and hydrocarbons, which are associated with road runoff. Charlotte Hitchmough, the director of Action for the River Kennet, said: \u201cThe people responsible for highway drainage actively encourage the disposal of polluted rain water straight into the river, even rivers that have the highest levels of legal environmental protection. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Down to Earth Free weekly newsletter The planet's most important stories.

In urban areas this is a perennial problem. Every summer we experience fish kills in those rivers where there are fish remaining.\u201d Fish are not the only species under threat. Prof Andrew Johnson, from the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, said persistent and bioaccumulative chemicals such as PAHs could reach the ocean, \u201cin which case we start to worry about animals such as cetaceans [dolphins, porpoises and whales]\u201d. However, he said the risk was hard to determine because the chemical loads were unknown. An Environment Agency spokesperson said outfalls and road drains were \u201cnot directly regulated by the Environment Agency but we do work with the government and partner organisations to reduce pollution from roads. This includes working closely with National Highways to influence their road investment strategy to include pollution mitigating schemes on their priority list of outfalls.\u201d Stephen Elderkin, the director of environmental sustainability at National Highways, said: \u201cWe are committed to addressing all of our high-risk water outfalls by 2030 and our water quality plan 2030 sets out a high-level programme of work to achieve this \u2026 National Highways has also invested in a programme of research to understand the risk of pollution from microplastics in road runoff.\u201d Under National Highways\u2019 plan, four outfalls have confirmed funding for mitigation this year, and \u201c17 outfalls and soakaways have been identified for potential delivery in 2024-25\u201d. Dr Sue Young, the head of land use planning at the Wildlife Trusts, said it was \u201chugely concerning that National Highways doesn\u2019t actually know the scale of the problem, and despite having identified over a thousand potentially polluting outfalls, it is mitigating just four of these this year. It\u2019s hard to see, with this snail\u2019s pace of action, how they will resolve this toxic issue by 2030. \u201cNature is in crisis now, with one in seven species in the UK at risk of extinction. We believe the next road investment strategy should allocate funding to act with greater ambition to stop this pollution now, rather than allowing most sites to continue putting this toxic mix into our most vulnerable rivers and streams until almost the end of the decade.\u201d",

Gold bars and stacks of cash: how Bob Menendez ended up charged with bribery Read more The New Jersey senator temporarily stepped down from his powerful position as chairman of the Senate foreign relations committee in September after he was indicted by federal prosecutors in New York on corruption charges, including allegations that he accepted cash bribes and gold bars in exchange for breaching his duties \u201cin ways that benefited the government of Egypt\u201d. Menendez pleaded not guilty to the allegations and has resisted calls for his resignation, including from fellow Democrats. Among former senior US officials and some Egyptian dissidents, one accusation included in the indictment against the senator stands out: that in May 2018, Menendez procured details from the state department about the number and nationalities of people working at the US embassy in Cairo, one of the largest US missions in the Middle East. Menendez is accused of passing this information to Egyptian officials, via his partner, Nadine Menendez, and a New Jersey businessman, Wael Hanna, who recently pleaded not guilty to charges that he bribed the senator. Menendez, Nadine Menendez and Hanna have all denied wrongdoing. The indictment states that \u201calthough this information was not classified, it was deemed highly sensitive because it could pose significant operational security concerns if disclosed to a foreign government or if made public\u201d. The FBI has also reportedly opened a counterintelligence investigation related to the charges. \u201cIf the allegation is true, this is reprehensible. One of the worst aspects of this is that it\u2019s not only selling influence, it\u2019s really putting people\u2019s lives in jeopardy,\u201d said a former high-ranking state department official who worked across the Middle East, including Egypt. \u201cI\u2019d label this charge in the indictment a betrayal of trust,\u201d said Gordon Gray, a former diplomat with 35 years in the foreign service whose postings included ambassador to Tunisia, senior adviser to the US ambassador to Iraq and deputy chief of mission in Cairo. \u201cOur Egyptian employees \u2026 work for us under potentially high risk to themselves and their families.\u201d It\u2019s also a betrayal of trust of the US government writ large to protect its people Former diplomat Gordon Gray He added: \u201cIt\u2019s also a betrayal of trust of the US government writ large to protect its people.\u201d The state department declined to respond to questions about the impact of the apparent leak or whether it was providing additional security to individuals who may have been compromised. US personnel with knowledge of the Egyptian security state have long understood the specific risks facing diplomats based in Cairo \u2013 and that those working at the embassy, particularly Egyptian nationals, were likely to be the target of surveillance by Egyptian intelligence. Such fears sharply increased after the 2013 military coup that brought Egyptian president Abdel-Fatah al-Sisi to power, which spurred a resurgence in the power of Egyptian intelligence bodies. For the US embassy in Cairo, the arrest and detention of staffer Ahmed Aleiba a year later was a watershed moment. Reporting in Egyptian pro-government media suggested that Aleiba, an Egyptian national, was detained and transferred to the custody of an Egyptian intelligence body after accusations that he had coordinated meetings between US officials and the Muslim Brotherhood, a banned group. Pressure on foreign missions has also extended to those who meet with diplomats: in 2020, two employees of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights, a prominent human rights organisation, were detained by security forces after hosting a meeting for a group of western diplomats at their offices in Cairo. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to First Thing Free daily newsletter Our US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it matters Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Following Menendez\u2019s indictment, acting foreign relations committee chairman Ben Cardin as well as members of Congress moved to block a further $235m, the maximum possible amount, until Egypt\u2019s record on human rights improves. Others said that while the information on embassy staff that Menendez allegedly passed to Egyptian officials was subject to constant change, it was valuable because Egyptian intelligence would have been able to compare it to other data secured through surveillance, to gauge which members of the embassy could be employees of US intelligence organisations and target Egyptian staff working there long term. \u201cThe Egyptian government wouldn\u2019t just be relying on Menendez for information like this \u2013 obviously they have their own sources and methods of how to source it, including visas, passports and counting the numbers,\u201d said Ben Fishman, a former member of the US national security council overseeing north Africa and Jordan. Referring to the allegations in the indictment, he added: \u201cBeing willing to convey that information and forward it on is, in my view, inappropriate for a senator.\u201d Gray pointed to how Egyptians employed at the embassy are particularly vulnerable to intimidation by local security forces. \u201cThe pressures that the locally engaged staff face are always on the mind of US embassies, at least US embassies in non-democracies,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t have diplomatic immunity, and their families are there. It can be a much more precarious situation for them.\u201d One US-based Egyptian dissident said the Egyptian government would be aware of Egyptians staffing the US embassy in Cairo, and believed there were likely already informants who work for Egypt inside the embassy. But he said the alleged sharing of sensitive and non-public information, as described in the indictment, meant that Egypt gained another, highly reliable, source of information about embassy employees. \u201cIt would have been seen as a definitive list,\u201d the person said.",

    "description": "With the blockbuster success of the \"Barbie\" movie and the related expansion of Barbie branding and merchandising, educators and parents may find themselves wondering about Barbie's original purpose: as a child's toy.",
    "content": "October 5, 2023 This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies . Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility: fact-checked trusted source written by researcher(s) proofread by Ozlem Cankaya, The Conversation With the blockbuster success of the \"Barbie\" movie and the related expansion of Barbie branding and merchandising , educators and parents may find themselves wondering about Barbie's original purpose: as a child's toy. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1449240174198-2'); }); Barbie has become an icon since her introduction in 1959 . On the positive side, dolls like Barbie can serve as a canvas for imaginative storytelling and role-playing . Children often create elaborate scenarios, dialogs and relationships among their dolls, and they refer to the thoughts, emotions and desires of themselves and others while playing, supporting language and emotional development . Dolls often act as catalysts for children to explore different roles (or careers) and social scenarios, potentially encouraging aspirations and broadening horizons. Additionally, Barbie play can promote fine motor skills as children dress and accessorize the dolls. Dolls can also facilitate social interaction when shared with peers or caregivers. However, there is a potential downside. Barbie dolls come with predefined appearances and characteristics, which can limit the range of narratives a child may explore. There is also marketing of an entire \"Barbie world\" of branded objects , which many parents may choose not to invest in for financial or environmental reasons. In the face of consumer pressures, while also being mindful of educational aspects of play, parents or caregivers can consider integrating open-ended everyday objects and versatile toys into children's play with Barbie or other commercially successful toys. This is a rewarding approach that promotes growth, creative thinking , adaptability and a sense of wonder. While Mattel, the maker of Barbie, today features Barbies featuring multiple skin tones, hairstyles and body types , the original Barbie may reinforce certain stereotypes, particularly related to whiteness and gender roles . And while the Barbie brand has evolved, many unfortunate decisions were made historically. For example, in 2014 Mattel apologized after readers complained about a book where Barbie as a computer engineer waited for males to save the day from computer difficulties . Mattel's release of Teen Talk Barbie in 1992 sparked controversy due to a particular phrase: \"Math class is tough!\" The phrase perpetuates the stereotype that struggling with math is expected or even normal. The doll inadvertently contributed to a culture that discourages girls from pursuing mathematics and other STEM fields , reinforced gender biases and perpetuated misconceptions that can have far-reaching consequences on children's educational choices and career aspirations. When children play with dolls and toys, they are not just having fun, but also absorbing messages and attitudes from their playthings. Researchers name play in early childhood as one of the powerful early influences on later gendered outcomes . The choice of toys and play materials can contribute to how adults reinforce gendered patterns and habits, encouraging boys and girls to develop different interests and skills. For example, psychology researchers Emily F. Coyle and Lynn Liben explored the impact of gendered toy packaging in five-year-old children's STEM play with their mothers. Mothers and their child (31 daughters; 30 sons) were randomly assigned to play with a mechanical toy packaged for girls (GoldieBlox) or boys (BobbyBlox). They discovered children's independent play varied with game packaging. When preparing for the play, mothers who were provided BobbyBlox built more toy pieces than those given the GoldieBlox. Also, mothers built more with their sons, whereas they focused more on reading the toy's instructions with their daughters. Further exploration of young children's early STEM play patterns may effectively influence later outcomes. Encouraging children to modify and personalize their play experience in a variety of ways can mitigate some of the stereotypical gender-specific effects of Barbie-like dolls . Repurposing common materials to craft intricate settings and props, children are empowered to envision boundless scenarios. Creative fusion allows children to transform ordinary items into extraordinary elements within Barbie's world. For example: The personalized aspect of using everyday materials to create accessories or outfits for dolls, or combining toys to allow for envisioning new worlds, fosters a sense of autonomy in children and instills a sense of ownership and pride in their creations. As children engage in collaborative play and work together to construct shared goals, they practice communication, teamwork and negotiation. Using ordinary items also nurtures an early awareness of environmental consciousness in children, teaching them the value of repurposing materials, reducing waste\u2014and the wondrous capacity of imaginative play.

    "content": "to get the biggest news straight to your inbox 2023 continues to be a difficult year when it comes to layoffs. In the past couple of weeks alone, companies including , , , , , , , , and have all dismissed varying numbers of staff, ranging from 10 Hearthstone developers to more than 800 Epic employees. The reasons for these redundancies can vary. Crystal Dynamics and Beamdog, for example, were which also resulted in the closure of studios such as . Meanwhile the Keywords layoffs reported today are a consequence of . But when job cuts make headlines so frequently in such a short space of time, it's easy to see there are wider issues at work. reached out to a range of analysts, recruiters and investors, who all cite myriad factors that are a sign of the current economic climate: high interest rates, inflation, slowed growth, rising production costs, and increased competition (to name but a few). These challenges are not unique to gaming, as indicated by the widespread layoffs at major tech firms like Microsoft, Meta and Amazon. \"In gaming, the significance of 'efficiency' has risen dramatically over the last 18 months,\" Kantan Games CEO Serkan Toto tells us. \"There is a much higher sense of urgency now to save costs and run slimmer organisations. The pressure is on for game industry CEOs to pull out the hammer and handle the biggest cost block of them all, namely staff. And this is what we have seen in 2023. \"All this happens under a sense of 'If we don't do it, our competitors will and then eliminate us on efficiency,' and people get fired left and right at the moment. There is also the phenomenon that often CEOs think 15% to 20% of their people are redundant anyway at any point in time.\" Hiro Capital partner Spike Laurie believes you can trace the current wave(s) of layoffs to one in particular: Elon Musk cutting 50% of Twitter's workforce in November 2022. \"He had figured out from people's electronic passes that there were more people serving food in the cafeteria than actually there to eat it,\" he says. \"This was the impetus other business leaders needed in order to start looking carefully at the size of their companies and start making judicious cuts. Why? We have come to the end of an economic cycle, fuelled by an addiction to cheap and readily available cash. \"A year later, we're seeing cuts in the games industry workforce and many good, talented people losing their jobs and financial security. This is made more painful for those affected by the high cost of basic goods like energy and food.\" Widespread layoffs are made all the more galling by what IDG Consulting's SVP of consulting Emilie Avera describes as a \"glaring disparity\" between executive and non-executive compensation, particularly in publicly traded companies. \"While measures like contractor and employee layoffs effectively reduce overhead costs and momentarily boost the appearance of balance sheets, there's an evident lack of comparable reduction in total compensation packages for executives,\" she says. She continues: \"When it comes to executive compensation, the current imperative is a robust 'pay-for-performance' model, where executive boards strictly enforce benchmarks for the upper echelons of management. Their compensation should be tied to tangible outcomes and performance metrics, with compensation adjusted downwards if the set targets aren't met.\" The pandemic inevitably factors into the current state of the market, too. Avera observes that the games industry expanded dramatically while stay-at-home measures were in place, but this was never going to last. \"As money started to dry out, firms were forced to reassess the ways funds were allocated, with layoffs emerging as an immediate solution to cut expenses,\" she explains. \"The short-term vision of chasing aggressive growth, often at the expense of sustainable profitability was exacerbated by investors \u2014 lured by the promise of rapid returns, many pursued hasty acquisitions, often without sufficient diligence paired with poor budget management. This frantic approach, driven partly by a 'fear of missing out,' had the unintended effect of bruising the industry they had aimed to prop up.\" Avera compares this to the entertainment sector, where streaming platforms prioritised audience expansion over profitability. Just as the streaming space is now recalibrating by increasing prices to \"mend their unsustainable model,\" the games industry is going through \"a comparable reckoning.\" \"The pace of growth for the games industry has peaked. It will keep growing, but mostly driven by increasing population and better internet connectivity, rather than by strengthening fundamentals of the business\" Liz Prince, head of recruitment specialist Amiqus, says that from a hiring perspective, the current situation is more of a recalibration than a deep-seated industry issue that warrants serious concern. \"Firstly, I'd like to express my compassion for all those affected by the recent layoffs and studio closures,\" she says. \"These times are undoubtedly challenging, and it's deeply unsettling to see talented individuals in our industry facing job losses. \"Every sector undergoes cycles of expansion and retraction, and what we're seeing looks to be a post-COVID realignment. As we know, during the pandemic there was a huge surge in games and this sudden boom led to studios scaling up swiftly, making acquisitions, and perhaps some over-investment in certain areas. Now some studios need to readjust. But it's worth noting that while certain studios are facing challenges, there are many others that are expanding.\" Ampere Analysis' head of games research Piers Harding-Rolls agrees: \"This is nothing new, especially in tougher economic times, although the scale of big budget games development today means that when a project gets cancelled, this can lead to hundreds of layoffs and that means a broader impact than in the past. \"It wasn't long ago that a major talking point of the industry was talent shortage. Key positions within studios were going unfilled and competition between companies for talent was intense. For bigger companies, this was part of the strategic rationale behind many of the acquisitions that took place between 2019 and early 2022.\" He adds that the M&A spree during the past few years was also fuelled by \"lofty games company valuations\" that peaked during the pandemic, and the availability of cheap debt. However, debt is now considerably more expensive and company valuations have fallen since Microsoft first announced its record-breaking proposed purchase of Activision Blizzard. Laurie is also unsurprised by the recalibration and companies resorting to layoffs, noting that many have been housing \"large, unprofitable teams.\" \"For a while, at peak hype, there were too many games being made by too many new teams, funded by cheap money and by the temporary boom in venture capital financing,\" he explains. \"Funds were pouring money into untested blockchain and metaverse studios, driving up wages but often not providing the studios enough runway to launch a game.\" Avera adds another factor: consumers are buying fewer games and spending more time with select franchises, a trend likely to accelerate as the market continues to shift towards live service titles. Even single-player titles are demanding more of players' time, with Avera noting that some of the biggest recent hits, including Baldur's Gate 3 and Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, take 50 or more hours simply to get through the main story. \"These lengthy games, combined with a labor/talent shortage among developers, engineers and designers, place immense pressure on an industry striving to capture as much mindshare as possible from a discerning gaming audience,\" she says. Kim Parker-Adcock, owner of recruitment agency One Player Mission, adds that consumers' spending habits have broadened again in the wake of lockdowns: \"People are spending what disposable income they have on going out, holidays abroad, events and so on. You will still get the die-hard gamers spending every spare dime on games but a lot less can afford a luxury item that might also require buying new hardware to play them i.e. latest consoles. Sony's recent exclusives are no longer being released on PS4, so you'll have to fork out \u00a3400+ for a PS5, too.\" Midia Research co-founder and senior analyst Karol Severin adds: \"The pace of growth for the games industry has peaked. The industry will keep growing in dollar terms, but it is mostly going to be driven by increasing population and better internet connectivity, rather than by strengthening fundamentals of the games business. While in-game spending will still grow, so will games subscriptions. And as cloud gaming subscriptions grow, there will be less of a need to buy high price point individual games. \"The games industry is about to see similar pressures as the music and video industries saw when streaming subscriptions truly took off. There will, of course, be many differences in how these dynamics will play out, but the fact that the value of an individual game in consumers' eyes will decline is inevitable. As such there will be a need for fewer games, therefore fewer developers and publishers.\" \"Every sector undergoes cycles of expansion and retraction, and what we're seeing looks to be a post-COVID realignment... While certain studios face challenges, many others are expanding Severin adds that the number of games released is growing significantly faster than global games revenue; for example, he says, Steam is tracking to have seen more than 13,500 games in 2023, compared to 12,500 last year. There is also the added issue of companies whose business models aren't necessarily dependent on games (such as Netflix, Amazon and Apple) increasingly grabbing for more market share. In terms of what the industry can do going forward, Avera has a series of suggestions. For example, she believes generative AI could be used to assist (but not replace) overburdened development teams and reduce total development time, and predicts that more companies will turn to outsourcers such as Keywords and Virtuos for services such as art, engineering, audio and more so their in-house teams can focus on their core strengths. User-generated content could also be a way to trim development costs, although she acknowledges there are imperfections in this business model, citing the public scrutiny over Roblox and its revenue-sharing models. But ultimately, Avera believes the industry needs to address its expectations. \"Righting the ship will require gaming companies and investors to agree on and adhere to realistic KPIs,\" she says. \"While positive sentiment around a game on social media platforms is heartening, it does not necessarily correlate with solid sales. Tangible metrics such as review scores, pre-sales, and proven track records of releasing games with minimal bugs should be appraised when making investment decisions.\" She adds: \"It's undeniable that some studios may experience further financial strain, and additional course corrections \u2014 including new layoffs \u2014 might be forthcoming. Yet these adjustments, however painful in the short term, are necessary steps toward ensuring a sustainable future for the gaming industry.\" Severin adds that there is no silver bullet, since so many of the factors behind these layoffs are out of the industry's control: inflation, interest rates, and so on. \"The games industry was staffed and invested for overdrive success and is simply correcting to a more natural/profitable equilibrium now,\" he says. \"Though much of the above sounds like doom and gloom, this industry isn't going anywhere \u2013 it will still be worth approximately $187 billion this year. For games companies thinking of future projects, carefully planning routes to profitability over user growth will become increasingly important. Also, we see increasingly more success in the future for games that focus on capturing and serving enthusiastic niches, rather than competing for mass audiences.\" Toto warns that these layoffs are not about to ease off anytime soon, adding: \"There are still studios in the market that seem to be overstaffed, looking at them from the outside. My guess is we will see further bad news through 2024.\" Prince assures those affected by these and future layoffs that their skills and expertise are \"still very much in demand,\" noting that there are still plenty of studios looking for talent. Similarly, Parker-Adcock notes that the downsizing of studios often leads to new ones opening doors. \"Whilst these [new] studios are still growing, it's [key] to make sure they don't overspend to ensure their survival and again only hiring for critical roles. I don't see much changing until the new year once the industry has seen what sales have been like for their Christmas releases.\" Laurie concludes by observing that the future may \"superficially look challenging\" but the growth of the industry with Gen Z rising and games technologies being adopted by big tech firms like Meta and Apple means there is still cause for optimism. \"Now is the time for talented individuals to use the incredible suite of tools available to them to build fun and engaging experiences for people to enjoy,\" he says. \"If this round of layoffs in the industry is the catalyst people need to build new games in a leaner, more efficient and creative way, we are all richer for it. \"We must remember how lucky we are to work in such a flourishing industry. When the macroeconomic climate improves, games will inevitably be at the forefront of driving new growth and jobs. Our skills will be deeply valuable in the new forward looking digital economy.\" to get the biggest news straight to your inbox",

    "description": "Mahomes is on pace to set a career-high in rushing yards",
    "content": "' passing numbers have looked a bit different this year, as he's only on pace to throw for 4,276 yards and 34 touchdowns. These numbers -- along with a 92.0 passer rating -- are considered low for Mahomes as he's still finding ways for the to win football games despite not having to play at an MVP level every week. With the passing game not as strong as in years past, Mahomes has turned to his legs to generate yards for the Chiefs. Through four games, Mahomes has 23 carries for 154 yards, a career high of 38.5 rushing yards per game. \"I'd probably just say more coverage. I haven't had a lot of pressure yet. I mean I'll obviously probably get some more this week,\" Mahomes said to reporters Wednesday, via a Chiefs transcript. \"They're playing a lot more coverage and dropping deep into coverages, and so it's opened lanes for me to scramble. That's something that I've always done. It just usually happens later in the season more than early, so (I'm) just trying to do whatever to go out there and win.\" The rushing yards average (38.5) easily surpasses Mahomes' previous career-high of 22.4 rushing yards per game, set in the 2021 season. Mahomes has never rushed for more than 381 yards in a season, but is on pace to shatter that mark. At this rate, Mahomes will have 655 rushing yards in 2023 -- more than he had in his first two full seasons as a starter combined (2018-2019). Mahomes isn't or running the football, but it's a part of his game defenses have to respect. His primary read is to throw the football, yet he'll take off to move the chains if necessary. \"I think what makes those dudes so great is that they can throw the football, too. I just have to be able to throw the football and then whenever the opportunity comes, just get enough yards to keep the chains moving,\" Mahomes said. \" I'm just trying to move the chains, and obviously, I want to throw for it. I want to make the throws, but when the opportunity arises, just \u2013 if I'm going to take it, make sure I go get the first down. \"It's just something you have to balance throughout the season is when to run for it, when to slide, when to throw the football and try to find ways to win games.\" Until the pass offense is able to make plays consistently, Mahomes is going to use his legs as an advantage to keep the offense on the field. The Chiefs' record hasn't been affected by the added dimension Mahomes has put in his game.",

    "content": "The co-leaders in both the SEC East and the SEC West meet up during the Week 6 college football schedule. In the East, No. 20 goes to Athens to take on top-ranked , and the Bulldogs are 14.5-point favorites in the latest Week 6 college football odds via the SportsLine consensus. It's expected to be a tighter matchup in the 3:30 p.m. ET SEC on CBS matchup when hosts No. 11 (-2.5). There's also a SEC crossover matchup between ranked teams as No. 21 hosts No. 23 (-6.5). Other Week 6 college football spreads of note around the nation include No. 3 (-6.5) vs. No. 12 in the 2023 Red River Showdown, No. 10 at No. 25 (+6.5), and No. 4 hosting (+19.5). Before locking in any Week 6 college football picks on those games or others, be sure to . Sallee is a true insider -- a CBS Sports analyst, SiriusXM host, Heisman voter and consistently one of the top CBS Sports experts picking games against the spread. He debuted with SportsLine in 2017 and has delivered his three best to members each week. Now, he has turned his attention to the Week 6 and is sharing his top three best bets over at SportsLine. If you parlay them together, you could be looking at a return of around 6-1. . One of Sallee's top Week 6 college football picks: He's taking No. 17 (-20.5) to cover against in an 8 p.m. ET kickoff on Saturday. Georgia Tech had one of the worst losses among Power Five teams in Week 5, giving up 38 unanswered points and ultimately falling 38-27 to , a MAC squad that entered that game winless against FBS competition. Miami, meanwhile, is cruising with a 4-0 straight-up record and three covers in as many tries against FBS competition this year. \"Their perfect season will continue this weekend against a wretched Yellow Jackets squad,\" Sallee told SportsLine. \"The Jackets haven't found their offensive identity, and Miami's defense has created chaos in every game this season. Even if this game is close for a half -- which is unlikely -- Miami will pull away in the second half for an easy cover.\" . Sallee has also found two other college football picks he loves, including backing a Group of Five underdog that he says can not only cover, but win outright. .",

    "description": "Levi's: From Fashion Icon to Corporate Distress \u2013 A Tale of Ups and Downs in the Denim Business. Can it find a new vision for the future?",
    "content": "Forbes Money Investing The Distressed Look At Levi Strauss Is In The Corporate Suite Who Are Lacking Vision Greg Petro Contributor Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own. Following Oct 5, 2023, 01:01pm EDT | Press play to listen to this article! Got it! Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin The Distressed Look at Levi Strauss is in the Corporate Suite Who are Lacking Vision getty In the fickle business of fashion, the popularity of denim has ebbed and flowed over the years, and likewise, the fortunes of Levi Strauss. This venerable brand invented blue jeans in 1873. Just two years ago, Levi\u2019s was riding high, sporting a market capitalization of $12 billion in May 2021, up from about $6 billion just two years earlier when it went public. For over three decades before that, Levi\u2019s had been a struggling, privately held company whose core audience was aging out. Today, the company is worth about $5.3 billion, less than half what it was in 2021 when consumers were spending all that pandemic stimulus money to trade up and look good in Levi\u2019s. The stock price has fallen from a high of about $29 a share to where it is today, about $13.50. Since 2021, the company seems to have again lost its way under CEO Chip Bergh, a former US Army captain recruited in 2011 as group president for global grooming at Procter & Gamble. After working his way up the ranks over nearly three decades, Bergh has said he left P&G when he realized he would not be a candidate for P&G\u2019s CEO. So, rather than the fashion maven that Levi\u2019s needed, the company\u2019s board picked Bergh, an ambitious corporate executive responsible for such brands as Tampax and Gillette. The problem at Levi\u2019s is not their distressed jeans; it\u2019s distress in the C-suite. In the quarter ended June 30, the company posted a $1.6 million loss compared with nearly $50 million a year earlier. The company is now a consumer retail laggard. Anyone who follows fashion industry trends as closely as I do might have predicted Levi\u2019s recent problems. For me, it was when I noticed that Bergh showed up at virtually every industry event and conference wearing an astonishing outfit for how out of step it is with the current culture \u2013 the so-called \u201cCanadian Tuxedo\u201d: denim jacket and jeans. Who wears denim jackets today? I thought this was a fashion exec out of step with the fashion market. Furthermore, as inflation-wary consumers trade down to save money, Levi\u2019s is losing to Walmart, Target, Tractor Supply, and other retailers expanding their private label lines at prices Levi\u2019s can\u2019t, won\u2019t, or shouldn\u2019t match.

At some point, skinny jeans on bulky bodies stop looking sexy. The trend is evident these days: jeans buyers are looking for room in their pants, wider legs, and stretchy materials. Skinny jeans may be dead, but as things stand, not the future of denim. The distress in Levi\u2019s corporate ranks may not be over. As part of a succession plan announced late last year, Bergh was recently to be replaced by Michelle Gass, the former chief executive of department store chain Kohl\u2019s. Gass takes over a company whose retail website promotes heavily discounted merchandise, and a whole section of denim jackets and other tops is a product category outside of its expertise (one exception: the trucker jacket). Last year, the company spent $400 million to buy Beyond Yoga, which focuses on activewear and body-positive apparel \u2013 think stretch pants. They have a wide array of \u201cWestern\u201d tops, and one would argue a complete lack of product vision. The bottom line: Levi\u2019s has lost its fashion sense and any product vision. The company seems to be clinging to the past, a past that belongs to a fashion cohort that is more concerned with getting in and out of their cars without having to hold their breath than looking sexy and having spoken to several friends and colleagues about what the first thing that crosses their minds when asked about Levi\u2019s? Their response was, \u201cThe past\u201d. Levi\u2019s needs a make-over. A vision. New ideas for a future, not a past. Check out my website .

    "description": "Atoms within the enormous ball of iron in Earth's inner core may move around much more than previously thought, which could explain recent findings about the core's surprising softness.",
    "content": "Scientists recently discovered that 's inner core, which was long thought to be an unmoving ball of solid metal, might be a lot less rigid than we expected. Now, a new study suggests this surprising softness may be caused by hyperactive that move around within their molecular structure much more than we realized. The inner core is a massive spherical lump of metal, predominantly iron, that spans roughly 760 miles (1,220 kilometers) and . The inner core is enveloped by the outer core \u2014 a sea of swirling liquid metals \u2014 that is in turn surrounded by a massive layer of molten rock, known as the mantle, which sits just below the solid crust we live on. The pressure at the heart of our planet is immense, so experts initially believed the core must be completely solid and that the iron atoms within it, which are arranged in a massive hexagonal lattice, must be permanently held in place. But in 2021, seismic waves from earthquakes , which led some scientists to describe it as a \"mushy hidden world.\" Subsequent studies suggested this or that the core exists in a \"superionic state,\" where atoms from other elements like carbon and hydrogen are . The new study, published Oct. 2 in the journal , provides an alternative explanation for what is going on inside the inner core. The researchers recreated the intense pressure within the inner core in the lab and observed how the iron atoms behaved under these conditions. The scientists then fed this data into a computer-learning program to create a simulated virtual core that they dubbed the \"supercell.\" Using the supercell, the team was able to see how the iron atoms moved within their supposedly rigid structure. The results suggest the atoms inside the inner core can \"move much more than we ever imagined,\" study co-author , a geophysicist at the University of Texas at Austin, said in a . The supercell simulations show that some of these atoms can move around in groups, taking up other positions in the lattice without compromising its overall shape \u2014 kind of like how dinner guests change seats at a table without adding or removing chairs, researchers wrote in the statement. This type of movement is known as \"collective motion.\" \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \"This increased movement makes the inner core less rigid [and] weaker against shear forces,\" Lin said. This could explain why the inner core is \"surprisingly soft,\" he added. The researchers believe that the new findings could also reveal new insights into other inner core mysteries, like how it helps to generate . \"Now, we know about the fundamental mechanism that will help us with understanding the dynamic processes and evolution of the Earth's inner core,\" Lin said.",

He characterizes McCarthy as a conservative who had at least some interest in actually governing, but is now set to be replaced with a hardliner who will be even more difficult to work with. Writing in the Washington Post , Bloomberg says: McCarthy\u2019s failure to reach out to Democrats was inexcusable, of course. But so too was Jeffries\u2019 failure to extend an olive branch. Not only has it empowered the Republicans\u2019 extreme right wing, but it also squandered an opportunity for Democrats to increase their influence. Jeffries had a chance to use the crisis to push for a more bipartisan governing model in the House, one that would have given Democrats more involvement in crafting legislation and conducting oversight. It could have been a transformative moment for Congress and the country. But if any informal Democratic overture occurred, it was too little, too late. It\u2019s true that McCarthy gave no indication he would have had the good sense to accept a serious peace offering by Jeffries. But even if he had rejected it, Democrats could have shown voters that at least one party in Washington is serious about finding common ground. Their failure to make a peace offering falls heaviest on the party\u2019s moderates, who speak of bipartisanship but, when push comes to shove, don\u2019t practice it. Now, with the House paralyzed, not only is Congress failing to do the people\u2019s business, but aid to Ukraine has been indefinitely paused, helping Russia\u2019s war effort and costing people their lives. \u201cThere has to be an adult in the room,\u201d McCarthy said over the weekend, after keeping the government from shutting down with the help of Democrats. He was right. Sadly, in the end, neither he nor Jeffries could do the adult thing, by reaching across the aisle to prevent Congress from sinking even deeper into dysfunction. 18m ago 17.59 BST Biden says border wall won't work, but law required construction Joe Biden explained that his administration was moving forward with building a wall on the US border with Mexico because federal law required it \u2013 even though he does not believe it will work. Here are comments he made to the press from the Oval Office: President Biden defends moving to build border barriers in a portion of the Rio Grande Valley, saying funding was already appropriated and he \u201ccan't stop that\u201d despite asking Congress to redirect the money. Asked if he thinks the border wall works, Biden says \u201cNo.\u201d pic.twitter.com/U9dRRl4Lbk \u2014 The Recount (@therecount) October 5, 2023 Environmental advocates are furious with Biden for waiving federal laws in order to move forward with the construction, even though his own administration said in its early days in office that such a barrier would not be effective. Here\u2019s the latest on this story: Biden criticized for waiving 26 laws in Texas to allow border wall construction Read more 35m ago 17.42 BST For a sense of how the GOP is trying to spin this week\u2019s theatrics in the House, take a look at this tweet from the National Republican Congressional Committee, which is tasked with winning seats in the chamber: Extreme House Democrats are the Chaos Caucus. pic.twitter.com/SDtxWqdKg3 \u2014 NRCC (@NRCC) October 5, 2023 All the Democrats you see there represent swing or red districts, and many won re-election only narrowly last year, when Joe Biden \u2019s allies overperformed expectations thanks to factors like the downfall of Roe v Wade and successful warnings about GOP extremism. The Democratic caucus was unanimous in voting to oust Kevin McCarthy , arguing that they were merely keeping with the common practice of the minority party in the House refusing to support the majority\u2019s choice for speaker. 54m ago 17.23 BST Trump considering visit to Capitol to meet with House Republicans ahead of speakership election Hugo Lowell Donald Trump is considering meeting with House Republicans at the Capitol next week, a source familiar with the former president\u2019s plans tells the Guardian, as his party works to elect a new speaker following Kevin McCarthy \u2019s overthrow. Trump is the frontrunner for the GOP\u2019s presidential nomination, and has been endorsed by several House lawmakers. He has denied involvement in congressman Matt Gaetz \u2019s successful effort to remove McCarthy from power, and both lawmakers call themselves Trump allies. 1h ago 17.15 BST More hints of the dynamics of the speaker\u2019s race within the House Republican Conference are emerging. The latest report is from the Messenger , which, citing unnamed sources, reports that Steve Scalise began campaigning to replace Kevin McCarthy even before he had been officially ousted. Scalise, the majority leader, is one of two major candidates who have declared their candidacy, along with judiciary chair Jim Jordan . Both are staunch conservatives, and the Messenger\u2019s report may explain why McCarthy\u2019s aides are reportedly encouraging lawmakers to support Jordan: Kevin McCarthy had just been ousted as speaker of the House. Republicans \u2014 and the entire Congress \u2014 were stunned. Yet McCarthy\u2019s deputy, House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., wasted no time, as he quietly launched a bid to become the next speaker, multiple sources tell The Messenger. Four Republican sources say Scalise started his campaign for speaker on Tuesday evening, moments after the House approved a far-right motion to vacate McCarthy from the speakership, before any other member had formally declared a candidacy. One House Republican who was lobbied by Scalise early Wednesday morning said the Louisiana Republican\u2019s outreach was \u201cwas too early.\u201d \u201cThe body wasn\u2019t even cold,\u201d the lawmaker, who was granted anonymity to speak candidly about the speaker\u2019s race, told The Messenger. \u201cIt was bullsh--.\u201d The race to replace McCarthy has just two declared candidates so far: Scalise, and Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, the chairman of the powerful House Judiciary Committee. There is also Rep. Kevin Hern, R-Okla., who has fielded support from members but has not yet formally announced a bid. 1h ago 16.53 BST Another thing that could prove pivotal to determining control of the House next year: the revolt that ousted Kevin McCarthy from office. His ouster was unprecedented, and the GOP is still digesting its implications for their broader campaign to hold onto the House, and regain the senate and White House next year. One lawmaker, Ohio\u2019s Max Miller , told CNN it set the party back: Rep. Max Miller fears GOP chaos could cost them House \u2014 and said he told that to Trump this week. \u201cHe\u2019s incredibly upset.\u201d Accuses Matt Gaetz of using the \u201cMAGA cloak\u201d to make it seem like Trump backs him. \u201cThat's why he's so good at what he does is because he's a BS artist\u201d pic.twitter.com/Bss7KEPpvg \u2014 Manu Raju (@mkraju) October 5, 2023 2h ago 16.36 BST Speaking of the House, the Cook Political Report just got its hand on Alabama\u2019s new congressional map and, as expected, Democrats appear set to win a new seat in the state: NEW: a federal court just selected Alabama's new congressional map, featuring an additional Black majority district. Under the remedial plan, #AL02 swings from Trump +29 to Biden +12, virtually assuring a Dem pickup. pic.twitter.com/9sXRVGwELB \u2014 Dave Wasserman (@Redistrict) October 5, 2023 The redrawn map came after the supreme court struck down an earlier version that included only one majority Black district, in what the justices determined was a violation of the Voting Rights Act. The state\u2019s Republican lawmakers tried to get around that by enacting a new map that didn\u2019t follow the court\u2019s decision, leading them to again order Alabama to draw new maps . With Republicans controlling the House by only four seats, the decision could prove pivotal to Democrats\u2019 quest to retake the majority in next year\u2019s elections. 2h ago 16.15 BST Former George Santos campaign treasurer pleads guilty to felony An ex-campaign treasurer for George Santos , the Republican congressman who admitted to lying about large portions of his resume and is currently facing federal fraud charges, will plead guilty to an unspecific felony, prosecutors have announced, according to the Associated Press. It is currently unknown to what charge Nancy Marks is admitting guilt, the AP reports. A veteran of Long Island politics, Marks worked with Santos on his two congressional runs. In May, federal prosecutors indicted Santos on 13 charges, including fraud and money laundering. Democrats have called on him to resign, and Santos is currently being investigated by the House ethics committee. 2h ago 15.57 BST Jim Jordan appeared on Fox News earlier today to make his pitch for why he would be a good speaker. Here\u2019s what he had to say: Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) on his candidacy for Speaker of the House in a Fox exclusive: \u201cYou need someone who can unite the conference \u2026 We have to have someone that can bring our team together. I think I\u2019m best equipped to do that.\u201d pic.twitter.com/ZVofF8glaI \u2014 The Recount (@therecount) October 5, 2023 3h ago 15.41 BST Back at the Capitol, Semafor reports that staffers for Kevin McCarthy have been making calls to support Jim Jordan\u2019s bid to replace him as speaker. Jordan is the chair of the judiciary committee a former leader of the far-right House Freedom Caucus, and among the most prominent of the lawmakers who boosted their profile by strenuously defending Donald Trump . The Ohio lawmaker is considered the strongest competitor to Steve Scalise , the House majority leader who is also vying to take over for McCarthy. Following his ouster from the speaker\u2019s chair on Tuesday, McCarthy did not endorse a successor, and Semafor reports it\u2019s unclear if his staffers are making calls to support Jordan at his orders. 3h ago 15.23 BST Trump asks for classified documents trial to be delayed till after 2024 election The Guardian\u2019s Hugo Lowell reports that Donald Trump has requested his trial on charges related to hiding classified government documents at Mar-a-Lago be delayed until after next year\u2019s presidential election: NEW: Trump asks for the Mar-a-Lago classified docs trial to be delayed until at least Nov 2024 \u2014 after the election \u2014 citing discovery complaints and the trial schedule for his lawyer Chris Kise. https://t.co/40Eiq6f527 \u2014 Hugo Lowell (@hugolowell) October 5, 2023 The former president is facing more than three dozen federal charges relating to taking classified materials with him when he departed the White House, then frustrating investigators\u2019 efforts to retrieve them from his south Florida resort. 3h ago 15.03 BST Republicans\u2019 demands have expanded from merely building a border wall. Some lawmakers and candidates, including Donald Trump, have recently publicly mulled invading Mexico, ostensibly to fight drug traffickers. As the Guardian\u2019s Ramon Antonio Vargas reports, on progressive Democrats wants them to knock it off: A progressive US congressman from Texas has asked his legislative colleagues to join him in condemning some American conservatives\u2019 calls to invade Mexico \u2013 ostensibly to do battle with drug cartels there. Joaquin Castro says he intends to file a resolution in the US House as soon as Friday reaffirming the federal government\u2019s \u201ccommitment to respecting the sovereignty of Mexico and condemning calls for military action without Mexico\u2019s consent and congressional authorization\u201d. The San Antonio Democrat and House foreign affairs committee member\u2019s proposed measure \u2013 a copy of which was provided to the Guardian \u2013 comes after a high-profile episode in May saw US senator John Kennedy urge the US to send its military into Mexico to confront drug cartels. In the process, Kennedy insulted Mexicans by saying they \u201cwould be eating cat food out of a can and living in a tent behind an Outback\u201d steakhouse restaurant if it were not for their proximity to the US. The racist remarks earned the Louisiana Republican criticism from Mexico\u2019s top government leaders as well as many of his compatriots. Former president Donald Trump, Florida governor Ron DeSantis and Vivek Ramaswamy \u2013 who are all seeking the Republican party\u2019s 2024 White House nomination \u2013 have similarly pledged to send US military forces into Mexico to wipe out drug lords if given the chance, as the Dallas Morning News reported . The resolution from Castro, who\u2019s served in the House since 2013, seeks to assert that the US and Mexico \u201chave cooperated for several decades on a variety of issues such as trade, investment, counter-narcotics, migration, rule of law and security, including through recent high-level security and economic dialogues\u201d. US representative files resolution decrying rightwing calls for invasion of Mexico Read more 4h ago 14.44 BST Biden waives federal laws to approve border wall construction The Biden administration has issued waivers to federal law in order to build border fencing in south Texas, the Associated Press reports. Building a wall along the US frontier with Mexico was a priority of Donald Trump \u2019s administration and remains so for many Republicans, but Joe Biden has opposed continuing the plan. His administration is however under pressure amid a surge in asylum seekers arriving at the southern border. Here\u2019s more on the wall construction, from the AP: The Joe Biden White House announced it waived 26 federal laws in south Texas to allow border wall construction on Wednesday, marking the administration\u2019s first use of a sweeping executive power employed often during Donald Trump\u2019s presidency. Homeland security department officials posted the announcement on the US federal registry with few details outlining the construction in Starr county, Texas, which is part of a busy border patrol sector seeing \u201chigh illegal entry\u201d. According to government data, about 245,000 illegal entries have been recorded so far this fiscal year in the Rio Grande Valley sector, which contains 21 counties. \u201cThere is presently an acute and immediate need to construct physical barriers and roads in the vicinity of the border of the United States in order to prevent unlawful entries into the United States in the project areas,\u201d the homeland security secretary, Alejandro Mayorkas, stated in the notice. The Clean Air Act, Safe Drinking Water Act and Endangered Species Act were some of the federal laws waived by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to make way for construction that will use funds from a congressional appropriation in 2019 for border wall construction. The waivers avoid time-consuming reviews and lawsuits challenging violation of environmental laws. Starr county\u2019s hilly ranchlands, sitting between Zapata and McAllen, Texas , is home to about 65,000 residents sparsely populating roughly 1,200 sq miles (3,108 sq km) that form part of the Lower Rio Grande Valley National Wildlife Refuge. Although no maps were provided in the announcement, federal customs and border protection officials announced the project in June and began gathering public comments in August when they shared a map of the additional construction that can add up to 20 miles (32km) to the existing border barrier system in the area. The Starr county judge Eloy Vera said it will start south of the Falcon Dam and go past Saline\u00f1o, Texas. \u201cThe other concern that we have is that area is highly erosive. There\u2019s a lot of arroyos,\u201d the county judge said, pointing out the creeks cutting through the ranchland and leading into the river. Biden waives 26 federal laws in south Texas to allow border wall construction Read more 4h ago 14.25 BST From the Guardian\u2019s Martin Pengelly and Joan E Greve , here\u2019s a look at two of the frontrunners who have emerged to replace Kevin McCarthy \u2013 both conservatives, but know for taking different approaches to governing: Jim Jordan of Ohio and Steve Scalise of Louisiana announced Wednesday they would seek to succeed Kevin McCarthy as speaker of the US House of Representatives, after the Californian was brutally removed by his own Republican party on Tuesday. Jordan is chair of the powerful judiciary committee, while Scalise is the majority leader. Both had been named as potential successors to McCarthy, and they confirmed their intentions to run for the top House job a day after the speakership was declared vacant. Pitching his candidacy in a \u201cDear Colleague\u201d letter, Jordan pledged to unify his fractious conference, which has repeatedly stumbled under the weight of a razor-thin majority. \u201cWe are at a critical crossroad in our nation\u2019s history. Now is the time for our Republican conference to come together to keep our promises to Americans,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cNo matter what we do, we must do it together as a conference. I respectfully ask for your support for speaker of the House of Representatives .\u201d But Scalise argued he had the experience needed to unite the conference, after serving as part of the House Republican leadership team for the past decade. \u201cI have a proven track record of bringing together the diverse array of viewpoints within our Conference to build consensus where others thought it impossible,\u201d Scalise said in his own \u201cDear Colleague\u201d letter. \u201cWe have an extremely talented Conference, and we all need to come together and pull in the same direction to get the country back on the right track.\u201d Republicans Jim Jordan and Steve Scalise launch House speakership bids Read more 4h ago 14.10 BST Few expect House to have new speaker by Wednesday - reports In theory, the House will be back to normal by next Wednesday, when lawmakers will vote on a new speaker. In practice, few in the chamber believe the infighting that led to Kevin McCarthy \u2019s overthrow will be resolved by then. Reports concluding this have been trickling out over the past day, and, this morning Axios revealed some of the dynamics behind this dysfunction. \u201cThere are way too many potential blowup points for this leadership vacuum to be easily resolved, thanks to a rump caucus of Republicans who proved they\u2019ll break with the overwhelming majority of their colleagues,\u201d they write. Conservatives are unlikely to vote for any candidate that would give more aid to Ukraine, while moderates want whoever is the new speaker to make it more difficult to remove the chamber\u2019s head. And then there\u2019s the fact that, with 435 members, there are plenty of people in the House who just don\u2019t like each other. We\u2019ll get a sense of these dynamics over the days to come, and especially on Tuesday, when a candidate\u2019s forum for those seeking the speaker\u2019s post will be held. 5h ago 13.47 BST McCarthy's ouster imperils Ukraine aid, threatens government shutdown Good morning, US politics blog readers. Not 48 hours after the House of Representatives was paralyzed by a far-right revolt that ousted Kevin McCarthy from the speaker\u2019s chair, the broader implications are becoming clear. Leaderless, the chamber is in disarray, but lawmakers nonetheless have crucial work to do. One of McCarthy\u2019s last acts was passing a deal to prevent a government shutdown that would have begun this last Sunday, but the bill funds the government only till 17 November. That is more than a month away, but Congress is riven with divisions over government spending, and the House\u2019s present dysfunction robs lawmakers of time to address them. Then there\u2019s the prospects for continued American aid to Ukraine. That, too, must be approved by Congress, and while senators of both parties appear open to continuing to help Kyiv, House conservatives are opposed, with speaker candidate Jim Jordan saying he will not bring further aide to the floor, if elected. Joe Biden , meanwhile, said yesterday he is exploring other ways to assist Ukraine, and will make a major speech on it soon. We\u2019ll be following these stories today. Here\u2019s what else is going on: Biden will at 12pm eastern time receive a briefing on Ukraine from his national security team, which could perhaps lead him to reveal more details about his plan to continue aid. Should Republicans continue holding debates, even though presidential frontrunner Donald Trump is not attending? Some party officials think the answer should be no, Politico reports . Kamala Harris and a host of other politicians will be in San Francisco for senator Dianne Feinstein \u2019s funeral. Harris delivers remarks at 4pm eastern time.

    "description": "This week's value can be found outside of the biggest games on the slate",
    "content": "Week 6 of the season should be an exciting one, with four games pitting ranked opponents against one another. Outside of that, teams like No. 13 and No. 11 are expected to get tough tests against unranked opponents. But a lot of this week's betting value can be found outside of this weekend's top-billed games. A lot of the ranked matchups are either too close to call or filled with too much uncertainty to confidently find a value play. Not that some of the more notable games lack merit. The aforementioned Washington State Cougars are actually underdogs on the road against unranked , which is looking to pick up its first Pac-12 win and stay afloat in the conference race. No. 23 is looking to bounce back on the road against No. 21 in a game that could see plenty of offense. This column needs a bounce back, as well. After a 4-1 start to things, we've had just two hits in the last two weeks. Last week was filled with bad beats: starting quarterback was ruled out right before kickoff against , throwing the Jayhawks covering a 16.5-point spread out the window, while and came within three points short of hitting the over. 1-4 6-9 Here are the value plays that bettors should keep an eye on during Week 6 of the college football season. Friday, 7:30 p.m. | Boone Pickens Stadium -- Stillwater, Oklahoma Oklahoma State has managed to stumble its way through the 19th easiest schedule in the nation and still has two losses on its resume. The Cowboys started the year 2-0, though their season-opening 27-13 win against FCS did little to instill confidence, and have not won a game since. That includes a 33-7 loss to , which may have been a new low in Mike Gundy's tenure. Kansas State's only setback thus far was on the road against a now-ranked Missouri team. Both squads are coming off a bye here, but if Oklahoma State can lose by 26 against the likes of South Alabama, Kansas State should have no problem maintaining a pretty comfortable gap in this one. Saturday, 12 p.m. | Faurot Field at Memorial Stadium -- Columbia, Missouri LSU is the type of team that boasts an offense that few can stop and a defense that might be better off just staying on the bench. The Tigers (from LSU) are fresh off a 55-49 loss to -- the highest-scoring FBS game this season. LSU quarterback passed for 414 yards and four touchdowns. Four LSU receivers had at least 50 yards through the air. Now Daniels and company get to go against a Missouri team that ranks ninth in the SEC in pass defense, allowing over 242 yards through the air per game. Missouri is no slouch offensively. Quarterback , who is getting healthier each week since he hyperextended his knee against Kansas State, and wide receiver Luther Burden are a potent duo. The two have combined for 629 yards and four touchdowns, more than any other quarterback-wide receiver combo in the nation. All this to say, points should come easy in Saturday's game. Saturday, 3 p.m. | Rose Bowl Stadium -- Pasadena, California It's not everyday that the No. 13 team in the nation is considered an underdog, even if that team is playing on the road. But the Cougars enter Saturday's contest +3.5 against UCLA. Instead of hitting a spread with meager payouts -- especially one so thin -- the money line brings a ton of value here. In fact, it almost feels like stealing. UCLA hasn't seen a team like Washington State yet. The Bruins lead the Pac-12 in scoring defense, allowing just 11 points per game and are second in total defense, but they have yet to play an FBS team that ranks better than 61st in offensive efficiency. The Cougars rank 11th nationally in offensive efficiency, sixth nationally in total offense (533.8 yards per game) and fifth nationally in scoring offense (45.8 points per game). UCLA should be able to move the ball if this game evolves into a shootout, as Wazzu's defense is quite porous. But in that scenario, it's smarter to lean on a veteran quarterback like WSU's over UCLA freshman , who hasn't had to play in a game like that at the collegiate level. Saturday, 3:30 p.m. | Memorial Stadium -- Clemson, South Carolina Only one of Clemson's three games against power conference competition this season has reached 50 total points, and it took overtime to get there. On the other hand, Wake Forest and its opponents have combined for at least 50 points in all but one of the Demon Deacons' four games this year. That being said, Wake Forest has yet to play an FBS team with a winning record, and it has yet to try and move the ball against anything close to Clemson's defense. The Tigers are strong as ever on that side of the ball, pacing the ACC in total defense (266.4 yards per game) while allowing 20.8 points per contest. Wake Forest isn't going to score much, which puts the burden on Clemson. Dabo Swinney's squad has only managed at least 40 points on its own against FCS and a 1-3 team. Saturday, 6:30 p.m. ET | Mountain America Stadium -- Tempe, Arizona Before the season started this game might have been at worst a tossup, but it's pretty clear at this point that Colorado is the better team. The Buffaloes have already exceeded expectations, with a 3-2 record against the hardest schedule in college football. They've already beaten better teams than Arizona State, and came within seven points of shocking a squad that some see as a College Football Playoff contender. The Sun Devils, meanwhile, are 1-4. Their lone win was a three-point triumph against FCS in the season opener. To make matters worse, ASU is down to its third-string quarterback for Saturday's game, as starter and his backup are both out with injuries. Colorado's defense has been a concern this season, but it should be able to get enough stops against a shorthanded Arizona State.",

    "description": "The new WNBA Golden State franchise will begin play in 2025",
    "content": "Joe Lacob is no stranger to making bold promises and building winning teams. Now, the man who helped turn the into a dynasty -- with four titles and six Finals appearances since he bought the franchise in 2010 -- is hoping to do the same in the WNBA. On Thursday, the WNBA officially granted Lacob and the Warriors that will begin play in 2025. The yet unnamed team will play at Chase Center and practice at the Warriors' facility in Oakland. If all goes to plan, they'll be hoisting a trophy sooner rather than later. \"First press conference with the Warriors, I said we will win a championship in the first five years,\" Lacob said during a press conference to officially announce the team on Thursday. \"I'm telling you right now, we will win a WNBA championship in the first five years of this franchise.\" Put this in your bookmarks. owner Joseph Lacob vows that once play begins, they will win a championship in the first 5 years of their existence \ud83d\ude4c Lacob's claim may be audacious, but that's the kind of mindset any owner should have. It's also not out of the realm of possibility. The Seattle Storm won a title in their first five years of existence, and the Atlanta Dream got to two Finals in their initial five seasons. For a full historical account, here's a look at the timeline for the most recent expansion franchises. Note: This only includes teams that are still in operation and joined the league since 2000. As you can see, there is a wide range of outcomes for expansion franchises. The one common denominator is you're almost certainly going to be bad in your first season. From there a lot depends on draft luck, developing players, coaching and resources. On the latter, it's clear Lacob and Co. will spare no expense. The team isn't even playing yet and has its own dedicated practice facility, which some current teams can't claim. That kind of commitment doesn't guarantee success, but it goes a long way. \"We're coming in here, number one, to win,\" . \"Number two, we want to see this league and women's basketball grow, and we hope to be a big part of it. We think it's a watershed event for us to come in and commit to it in a big way. We're going to bring all of our resources. We can put this machine to work, and we're going to do that.\"",

    "description": "According to figures published by the journal Nature, 73% of the world's antibiotics are used in the production of domestic animals. They are used primarily for preventive purposes because these animals are kept in confined and unhygienic conditions, but are also administered to promote growth.",
    "content": "October 5, 2023 This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies . Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility: fact-checked peer-reviewed publication trusted source proofread by Christina Benjaminsen, SINTEF According to figures published by the journal Nature , 73% of the world's antibiotics are used in the production of domestic animals. They are used primarily for preventive purposes because these animals are kept in confined and unhygienic conditions, but are also administered to promote growth. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1449240174198-2'); }); The result is that bacteria are becoming increasingly resistant to essential and life-saving antibiotics. So says Gunhild Hageskal, who is a Senior Research Scientist at the Norwegian science institute SINTEF. Together with her colleagues, including Anne T\u00f8ndervik, she is currently working in the field of antibiotic resistance, which is currently regarded as one of the biggest threats to global public health. \"We know that resistant microbes can be transmitted from animals to humans via our food and the environment,\" says Hageskal. \"This interaction is recognized as part of a 'One Health perspective,' acknowledging that all things are interconnected and that the battle to combat resistance must be fought at all levels,\" she says. A reduction in the use of antibiotics alone is no longer sufficient to combat the global increase in resistant microbes. According to The Lancet , preventive approaches must be introduced in order to inhibit transmission, with a particular focus on the livestock sector. And the problem is getting worse. Global prognoses for 2050 indicate that 10 million people will die each year because bacteria are developing antibiotic resistance. In comparison, only 7 million died in the course of three years as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Together with Iceland, Norway can boast at being clearly among the best in the world when it comes to limiting its use of antibiotics in the livestock sector. It is prohibited in the Norwegian sector to use antibiotics to promote growth or prevent disease. However, you don't have to look any further than Denmark to find that it is common practice for pigs and other animals to be administered with antibiotics in their feed. According to the researchers, the situation is worse by far in Asia and South America. As consumers, we should bear this in mind when we buy Argentinian beef, Danish bacon or Spanish ham. Meat is of course incorporated into a variety of processed products, and even if the label says that the country of origin is Norway, this doesn't necessarily mean that the animal was reared in Norway. However, even if Norway's problems are small compared to the rest of the world, we shouldn't be complacent. The world is more globalized than ever, and resistant microbes (bacteria and fungi, Ed.) have no respect for national boundaries. We are currently already seeing an increase in infections that are difficult to treat in Norwegian hospitals. According to SINTEF researchers, 1.3 million people died in 2019 because their treatment failed as the result of antibiotic resistance. An additional 5 million died due to associated problems. We continue to find unwanted microbes in the Norwegian food production sector. This is why disinfection procedures are a very important part of the production process. The use of disinfection is crucial to disease prevention and the control of microbial threats in many fields, such as medicine, agriculture, aquaculture, food production, the drinking water and cleaning sectors, as well as personal hygiene. \"The problem is simply that the use of disinfectants can itself cause bacteria to develop resistance to antibiotics,\" says Anne T\u00f8ndervik, who is also a Senior Research Scientist at SINTEF. This issue is described as a gap in our knowledge as we engage in the battle against antibiotic resistance. When a bacterium is exposed to antibiotics it adopts a number of strategies to protect itself. In basic terms, these strategies are identical to those that it uses to protect itself against other chemicals such as disinfectants. Some bacteria are even resilient enough to ward off the very agents that are designed to destroy them. These can then reproduce, enabling their descendants to inherit their resistance. Resistance may also develop naturally as a result of genetic mutation. \"We have seen indications that disinfectants can promote resistance and possibly also so-called cross-resistance, which enables bacteria to resist the threats of both antibiotics and disinfectants,\" says Hageskal. \"It is well known that disinfectants that contain quaternary ammonium compounds (one of the three most common active substances used for disinfection) are able to promote antibiotic resistance,\" she says. It is this problem that SINTEF is currently addressing as part of the project called DisinfectAMR. Together with its research partners at NTNU, SINTEF is looking into the effectiveness of agents used to disinfect poultry and salmon production lines, and whether these may have unwanted side effects in terms of contributing to antibiotic resistance. In order to compare condition status in Norway with the situation overseas, researchers are working together with the University of Lasi in Romania, where scientists are taking samples from the premises of a local poultry producer. A Ph.D. student is also participating in the project. To date, researchers have been focusing on what are known as slaughterhouse processing lines. These conceal many nooks and crannies that are difficult to keep clean, even when premises are washed down and disinfected on a daily basis. \"This is where biofilms are created. Biofilms form thin, slimy layers of microbes that in some cases can be difficult to spot with the naked eye,\" says T\u00f8ndervik. \"Biofilms are another piece in the puzzle. They represent the natural habitat of bacteria and are well-known for acting as the cradle of resistance development,\" she says. The reason for this is that bacteria enjoy better protection in biofilms and can survive the disinfection process. It is easier for them to exchange so-called genetic elements when many are assembled in the same place. Biofilms are also known to be involved in 80% of all infections in humans. In order to evaluate the problem and investigate the links between antibiotic resistance and the various kinds of disinfectants, the researchers have collected bacteria from a number of surfaces in poultry and salmon processing lines. To date, they have established a \"clan assemblage\" of approximately 1,000 bacterial isolates, which are now being studied in detail in laboratories at SINTEF and NTNU. These bacteria are being identified and tested with a number of different disinfectants currently in use in the same processing lines. \"We're also studying the variety of bacteria in the biofilms in the processing lines\u2014the so-called microbiome\u2014both before and after disinfection in order to see how the disinfection process impacts on bacterial communities across the slaughterhouse,\" explains Hageskal. In the next stage of the project, the genomes in the microbiome will be mapped and analyzed. This will give the researchers a clearer picture of which resistance genes are present. Even if the researchers succeed in destroying a bacterium, the genes that carry the resistance may still be intact and can be transmitted in residual raw materials and wastewater. This is how the snowball keeps on rolling. \"For this reason, it's important to acquire as much knowledge as possible about how we can remove unwanted bacteria from the production process most effectively,\" says Hageskal.

    "content": "Attorneys representing former Michigan State coach Mel Tucker sent a 106-page letter to the university's interim president and board of trustees on Thursday outlining \"new evidence\" in his sexual misconduct case. This as the university begins its hearing, also Thursday, into allegations against Tucker made by rape survivor and activist Brenda Tracy. The letter, by attorney Jennifer Z. Belveal, aims to identify contradictions in Tracy's allegations, which led to Michigan State's investigation and Tucker's subsequent firing. It alleges that Tracy \"manipulated a key witness\" and \"deleted key evidence.\" It also claims Tracy's motivations for filing the complaint were financial and contains partially redacted messages between Tracy and her former assistant, now deceased. \"Money is my only recourse to make him feel like there is a punishment,\" Tracy wrote in one message, according to the letter, \"when they do the money I should make him pay me 10k directly.\" Tucker, who was not present at Thursday's hearing due to a \"serious medical condition,\" was initially suspended without pay on Sept. 10 after Tracy's allegations were made public. Michigan State initiated the firing process eight days later, citing Tucker's moral turpitude clause of his contract. Tucker and his attorneys are in which the coach claims university leadership had ulterior motives; by firing him with cause, Michigan State avoids paying Tucker the nearly $80 million left on his deal. Tucker amassed a 20-14 record during his time with the Spartans. He was hired in 2020 and the following year led Michigan State to its first 11-win season since 2015. Michigan State went 5-7 in 2022 and was off to a 2-0 start at the time of Tucker's suspension. Former defensive backs coach Harlon Barnett is serving as the interim coach for the remainder of the season.",

He was 80 years old. We're told someone went to check on Butkus at his home on Thursday ... and he was found unresponsive. The family later released the following : Dick Butkus, a legendary Bears Hall of Fame middle linebacker and Chicago native who many still consider the most ferocious defensive player in NFL history, has passed away. He was 80. The Butkus Family released the following statement: \"The Butkus Family confirms that football and entertainment legend Dick Butkus died peacefully in his sleep overnight at home in Malibu, Calif. The Butkus family is gathering with Dick's wife Helen. They appreciate your prayers and support.\" \"Dick was the ultimate Bear, and one of the greatest players in NFL history,\" Bears chairman George H. McCaskey said in a statement. \"He was Chicago's son. He exuded what our great city is about and, not coincidently, what George Halas looked for in a player: toughness, smarts, instincts, passion and leadership. He refused to accept anything less than the best from himself, or from his teammates. When we dedicated the George Halas statue at our team headquarters, we asked Dick to speak at the ceremony, because we knew he spoke for Papa Bear. \"Dick had a gruff manner, and maybe that kept some people from approaching him, but he actually had a soft touch. His legacy of philanthropy included a mission of ridding performance enhancing drugs from sports and promoting heart health. His contributions to the game he loved will live forever and we are grateful he was able to be at our home opener this year to be celebrated one last time by his many fans. \"We extend our condolences to Helen, Dick's high school sweetheart and wife of 60 years, and their family.\" They also posted this on Twitter: Dick Butkus was a legend who embodied what it means to be a Chicago Bear. Our hearts go out to his family and friends. As did the NFL: The NFL is mourning the loss of legendary Hall of Famer Dick Butkus. Our thoughts are with his family and the Bears organization. Fans on Twitter/X shared their reaction to Butkus's passing: Very sad. He is on the Mount Rushmore of Bears players. One of the best defensive players ever in football He once held the record for 26 fumble recoveries and is tied for 11th in Bears history at 22 career interceptions. The Bears retired his jersey in 1994. Damn, he was just on here tweeting like a week ago...RIP to a legend. He was. If the Bears don\u2019t win tonight\u2026 \ud83d\ude24 The Bears play Washington tonight for Thursday night football. Kickoff is at 7:15 pm Chicago time. Dick Butkus had one of the greatest commercials ever. He had a lot of very fun commercials. Throwback to this epic Dick Butkus exchange RIP to a great one This was epic. Super Sky Point to the predatory, legendary, and utterly hilarious Dick Butkus. He was, and always will be, the goddamn physical embodiment of the greatness of the city of Chicago. If your kids don\u2019t know, just tell \u2018em if he didn\u2019t know who had the ball he\u2019d tackle the entire\u2026 He was incredible on the field. To really understand the greatness of Dick Butkus, he was the NFL Defensive Player of the Year in 1969 despite the fact that the Bears finished 1-13. RIP to a legend. What an achievement. Dick Butkus presenting that ball to the defender after the TD in 1971 was priceless. RIP Priceless. Prediction: Bears lose by 51 points to honor Dick Butkus. RIP legend. This writer is a Packer fan, so it wouldn't be a post about the Bears without some good natured fun. Somebody give me some pads and a QB to tackle. Our sympathies and prayers are with the Butkus family and the NFL as they mourn the loss of one of the greats. ***",

    "content": "Hall of Fame linebacker Dick Butkus, whose name became synonymous with the Chicago Bears and hard-nosed defense, has died, his family announced Thursday. Butkus was 80. \"The Butkus family confirms that football and entertainment legend Dick Butkus died peacefully in his sleep overnight at home in Malibu, California,\" the family said in a statement. \"The Butkus family is gathering with Dick's wife Helen. They appreciate your prayers and support.\" Additional information was not yet provided. The news came less than two hours before the Bears were slated to face the host Washington Commanders in a \"Thursday Night Football\" matchup. Born in Chicago, Butkus built his memorable football career in his home state, becoming an All-American at Illinois before joining the Bears in 1965. Butkus became a two-time NFL Defensive Player of the Year (1969, 1970) and an eight-time Pro Bowl selection in a nine-year pro career before going on to work as a broadcaster, pitchman and actor. He played 119 games for the Bears, tallying 22 interceptions, 27 fumble recoveries and at least 11 sacks during an era when defensive statistics weren't closely kept. He is a member of both the College Football and Pro Football Halls of Fame. \"Some people were made to be doctors, others to be lawyers,\" Butkus once said. \"I was made to play football.\" --Field Level Media",

It probably had something to do with him declaring that American conservatives needed to be put in reeducation camps and made to do forced labor. \"American conservatism is a mental illness that needs to be eradicated through reeducation camps and forced labor\" Yes Apparently, he, like many others, was upset about conservatives being less than broken up about the murder of a far-left activist on a New York City street. Reportedly, his girlfriend, who watched him get stabbed to death in the chest, refused to give a description of the (black male) suspect caught on video doing it. She literally refused to tell the police the description of her boyfriend\u2019s killer because it would cause \u201cracist stereotypes\u201d. If anyone needs reeducation camps, it\u2019s progressives like her, nevermind the killers. You want people in \"Reeducation camps and forced labor\" and I'm the delusional? Who's going to put me in a camp if you already defunded the police? Reeducation camps and forced labor? Jestin wants to be him so bad, it\u2019s plain to see.

There's a shot of the activist's girlfriend showing off her MARX license plate. The chances of you and your friends making that happen is literally zero. And are you going to be putting these people through reeducation camps and forced labor, or are you just gonna expect LEOs and the military to do it? Congratulations on absolutely vindicating the very people you\u2019re trying to condemn lol What happened to Ryan Carson was horrific and absolutely meaningless. Sorry there are some who aren't as broken up about it. Bloomberg/WaPo op-ed writer is so mad about posts on Ryan Carson\u2019s stabbing that he deleted X from his phone. ..But he\u2019s still on here posting his article. And he\u2019s still going to \u201ccontinue to follow X.\u201d He\u2019s just really mad at There are 2 subreddits, one with 500K subscribers, anther with 1 million, dedicated to celebrating misfortune and deaths of political opponents, mostly conservatives.

    "content": "The football community lost an icon Thursday when Dick Butkus . Butkus was best known for his Hall of Fame career as a linebacker for the Chicago Bears from 1965-73, but his legacy is not limited to professional football. Butkus' legendary career at earned him a place in the Hall of Fame. His name is so synonymous with excellence that the award presented to college football's best linebacker every year bears his name. \"I am saddened to learn of the passing of Dick Butkus, the greatest linebacker in football history,\" Illinois coach Bret Bielema said in a press release. \"As the head coach of his alma mater that he loved, I had the great honor to meet Dick, one of my childhood idols, last September. He was an amazing person, as well as football player, and a loyal Illini. Dick embodied everything that Illinois football has represented in the past and what we look to represent into the future. His deep love for Illinois football will be honored and remembered forever.\" A Chicago native, Butkus attended Illinois in the early-to-mid 1960s, playing center and middle linebacker for the Fighting Illini from 1962-64. His impact for the Illinois program was immediate. Butkus was an All-Big Ten selection his first year. While the team finished 2-7 that fall, far more success for both Butkus and the program as whole was on the horizon. \"Dick Butkus was a giant in a land of giants,\" Illinois athletic director Josh Whitman said in a release. \"In a game built on toughness and tenacity, he stood alone. One of the most imposing figures to ever wear a helmet, away from the field, Dick was self-effacing, humble, and generous. A cultural icon, Dick leaves a legacy on Americana that will never be forgotten.\" The 1963 season saw Illinois compile an 8-1-1 overall record, capturing the Big Ten championship and ending the season with a Rose Bowl victory against for a No. 3 finish in the AP rankings. Butkus was the star of the show for the Illini defense that season, winning Big Ten Player of the Year honors and Unanimous All-American honors. In 1964 Butkus finished third in Heisman voting and was named a Consensus All American as Illinois finished 6-3 and ranked No. 16. \"Our University is better, our game is better, and our country is better, all because we were graced by the presence of one Dick Butkus,\" Whitman said. For his Illinois career, Butkus totaled 347 tackles. His 145 tackles in 1963 stood as a school record until 1976. Butkus also toppled the century-mark in 1964, registering 132 total tackles before he went No. 3 overall in the 1965 to the Chicago Bears. Butkus' No. 50 was retired by the university in 1986 before he was named to the Walter Camp Foundation All-Century team in 1989. Additionally, Butkus is a member of the Illinois Athletics Hall of Fame. By going on to play exclusively for Chicago in the NFL, Butkus was able to spend his entire football playing career within his native Illinois. In his eight-year NFL tenure, Butkus totaled 1,020 tackles, 22 interceptions, and 25 fumble recoveries. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1979.",

This season, however, the Mets were grave disappointments as they went 75-87 and finished in fourth place in the National League East despite the highest payroll in history. Eppler's resignation comes not long after former executive and new lead decision-maker. \"Billy Eppler led this team through a 101-win season and postseason berth last year and he will be missed,\" Mets owner Steve Cohen said in the statement released by the team. \"We accepted Billy's resignation today as he decided it is in everyone's best interest to fully hand over the leadership of Baseball Operations to David Stearns. On behalf of the Mets organization, we wish him all the best.\" \"I wanted David [Stearns] to have a clean slate and that meant me stepping down,\" Eppler said in that same statement. \"I hope for nothing but the best for the entire Mets organization.\" Given Eppler's presence at Stearns' introductory press conference, the decision comes a surprise. That may be explained by the reported investigation by the league noted above. While Stearns and the Mets will likely replace Eppler at some point, it's not an urgent matter given that Stearns is already in place atop baseball operations.

    "description": "\u201cWe\u2019re just on another level right now and it\u2019s really awesome.\u201d",
    "content": "HELENA \u2014 The Flying Bs of Bozeman High, bookended by two Neils, buried their competition Thursday afternoon at the Capital City 7 of 7 Invitational. In a very 2016-esque performance, the Hawks\u2019 boys team averaged a 21.51-second margin of victory in sweeping all seven races for the first time since 2016. \u201cThat was really fun,\u201d senior, and No.1 runner, Nathan Neil said. \u201cEvery single time one of our guys won a race, it just got me more hyped and ready to go\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s really fun to watch those guys achieve because they don\u2019t get all the hype I get, but they\u2019re right there working with me.\u201d Neil, last year\u2019s Class AA state runner-up, cracked the 15-second barrier for just the second time in his career, gapping Manhattan Christian\u2019s Oren Arthun with four-minute, 42.03-second and 5:04 second and third miles to post a 14:59.60. \u201cNot falling asleep in the middle of the race,\u201d Neil said of a sub-15-second key. \u201cWhen you\u2019re out by yourself, a lot of times it\u2019s easy to fall asleep and slow down a little bit. You just gotta keep pushing \u2013 that\u2019s really the key there.\u201d Neil, who posted the only other sub-15-second time in the state of Montana on Sept. 1, bested Arthun by 36.39 seconds, the largest margin of Bozeman\u2019s seven male runners on Thursday. \u201cWhen you see consistency in racing, it\u2019s because there\u2019s consistency in training,\u201d Hawks head coach Casey Jermyn said. \u201cIf you know Nathan, you know he is the most dedicated, the most consistent person\u2026 \u201cHe shows up every day and does his work out, does his long runs, does his recovery runs, and he\u2019s like a machine. When he\u2019s doing that in practice, you see those types of results in races.\u201d Taylor Neil, Nathan\u2019s freshman younger brother, set a personal record with his 16:46.12, while sophomores Miles Halvorsen (No. 5 race, 16:32.43) and Christian Landers (No. 3 race, 16:43.41) got close in victories. Kieran Anderson (16:53.52) and Daniel Johnson (16:36.68) won the No. 6 and No. 4 races for Bozeman, while first-year varsity runner Jeremy Posdon held off Helena High freshman Milo Kauffman in the No. 2 race. \u201cI was happy with that \u2013 I\u2019m really excited about my fitness,\u201d Posdon said. \u201cWe have a race we're going to in Seattle that I\u2019m really excited for, so today was to see how I felt and try to win\u2026 \u201cWe wanted to get the seven-people first place.\u201d Kauffman, whose second place represented the Bengals\u2019 best boys performance, out-paced Posdon with a 4:57.07 first mile. He fell into Posdon\u2019s wake with a four-second slower second mile, but turned in a really solid 5:33 third mile to establish a 10-second personal record (16:12.21) and finish just six and a half seconds behind his Bozeman counterpart. \u201cIt went really good,\u201d Kauffman said. \u201cI just went out, wanted to win, and tried to lead but I couldn\u2019t hold the guy. He just ran a better race.\u201d Running competitively since he was in seventh grade, Kauffman said he hopes to be All-State as a freshman. His previous best run of 16:22.9 ranked 23rd in Class AA entering Thursday. On the girls side, Hardin\u2019s Karis Brightwings-Pease repeated as girls No. 1 champion. The freshman and reigning Class A cross-country state champion PRed with a time of 18:15.77 to anchor a fourth-place finish for Hardin in the team standings. Bozeman\u2019s Natalie Nicholas (18:56.10) won the girls No. 6 race and Gallatin\u2019s Bella Determan (18:41.44) did the same in the No. 5 race. It was Determan who disrupted a streak of four consecutive Missoula Hellgate victories to begin the meet. Hellgate, the defending Class AA girls cross-country champions, won the girls team 7 of 7 title for the second time in four years, edging out Bozeman and Gallatin. Claire Rutherford (fourth, No. 1 race) and Isabel Ross (second, No. 2 race), Gallatin\u2019s standout sophomores from a year ago, anchored the reigning Class AA state third-place finishers on Thursday. \u201cIt was definitely painful \u2013 the hills are tough \u2013 but I think I did a good job of pushing through the pain and not slowing down when I felt like I needed to give up,\u201d Ross said of her race. \u201cI think everyone is on track to peak at state. The coaches\u2019 training plan has really put us in that position and I\u2019m really excited to see what we can do. I think we have a really good chance to do really well.\u201d Hellgate senior Rose Wiltse, who entered Thursday with the fastest girls 5,000-meter time in the state, finished fifth in the girls No. 1 race (19:00.04). Gia Petrini (19:00.12, No. 4 race), Myla Spoon (20:14.51, No. 5 race), Kaitlyn Skinner (20:15.76, No. 6 race) and Audrey Baldwin (20:40.80, No. 7 race) took home first place finishes for the Knights. So, back to that 2016 Bozeman boys team that swept the 7 of 7. It too was anchored by a sub-15-second performance (Chase Equall \u2013 14:55.14) and had some kid named Duncan Hamilton run the No. 3 race. Like those two, Nathan Neil has the talent to run collegiately and has committed to the University of Washington. According to Jermyn, the 2016 and 2023 teams are very equal in terms of depth. This team has aspirations of repeating as state champions, then chasing a regional and national championship, just like seven years prior. Bright and early Friday morning, the Hawks leave for the Nike Hole in the Wall XC Invitational right outside Seattle \u2013 a meet to see where Bozeman, and Neil, stack up nationally. \u201cYeah, definitely,\u201d Neil said of being favorites at the state meet. \u201cThis is a really, really fast year for Montana \u2013 Billings West is a great team, Great Falls High is a great team\u2026 \u201cWe\u2019re just on another level right now and it\u2019s really awesome.\u201d",

    "content": "So a spunky new technology e-zine has entered the foray - 404 Media. It appears 404 Media is a cutting edge publication personed with bright young minds who cover the tech scene with a left-leaning slant. So in other words, it's as fresh as Buzzfeed circa 2008. Oh, except one thing, it's paywalled for subscribers, which makes it as hip and cutting-edge as Substack, we guess. Anyway, this Tweet got a bit of buzz. Why? Well, there's a bit to unpack here. One, the time between a new technology and a tasteless meme is roughly 5.3 seconds in 2023 so we're not sure what the big deal is here. Two, the hipster journalist's efforts to 'problematize' everything is eye-rollingly played out. And three, there's the amusing running to Nintendo to ask if they knew what Bing was doing to their copyrighted characters. We also asked if it knew Bing is generating images of Kirby doing 9/11. It reminds us of the schoolyard gossip to runs to the mean girl and asks if she knows that the popular girl is talking smack about her to the jock who she ... well, you get the picture. i'm sorry, it's just funny how well this image captures the rush into generative AI tools with so little thought about consequences Naw, brah, it's just funny. Period. But at the same time, we also can't stop laughing and the self-important chin scratching concern over how 'little thought about consequences' relates to a Spongebob Squarepants meme done in bad taste. Did we mention that the author was so disturbed by this that she created the memes herself? I generated a bunch of AI images of beloved fictional characters doing 9/11, and I\u2019m not the only one. Let's get back to what you're here for - the ruthless and well-deserved mockery. holy shit I just typed this into a word processor and it straight up allowed me, murder is NOT actually good you guys omg we are NOT ready for the future Props to Mike for getting right to the heart of the matter in hilarious form. It\u2019s weird. There\u2019s definitely a problem. I typed \u201cdumb person writes an article\u201d into Bing and it linked me to this tweet. No, I think AI is actually working in this case. Oh, how clever you are, remembering memes and recycling them. Want a cookie? Others took the ball and ran with it. Bing is literally killing people Of course. If we can't lay this tragedy at the feet of an evil corporation, did it even happen? Other than that, Mario, how was the play? Spit take worthy! Thank you Pete. Did you think about the consequences? Wait 'til he sees this. It'll send him over the edge. Bonus points for the mashup with the Current Thing! Did you also blame Crayola for your application to journalism school? We do. Maybe Kirby is trying to save lives by kamikazing into the planes the terrorists are flying? Did you think of that? Our own Aaron Walker has thoughts. This kind of stuff is silly and will result in silly laws being passed and I want off this rock. Not wrong. You don't think mediocre journalists gunning to be the next Upton Sinclair don't cause stupid laws? Consider the plastic straw hysteria. we should have more sympathy for people who are technologically illiterate and have never built anything, just now grasping the idea that a computer will do whatever you tell it to do thanks to AI making compute accessible, even to journalists. it\u2019s probably very frightening. It's like momma said, 'those who can, do, those who can't, teach and those who fail, problematize.' Journalism is when you buy a knife, stab someone with it, then attack the knife manufacturer for not doing more to stop you And that's all we got to say about that. This is how you create a story on a slow news day. Wait, no! One more. And that's a wrap. ***",

    "description": "Paul has been excellent next to superstar guards during previous stops in his career",
    "content": "The new-look are looking to bounce back from a disappointing season with the offseason addition of , but there are certainly questions about his fit. The 38-year-old future Hall of Famer rose to excellence by having the ball in his hands and operating almost exclusively out of the pick-and-roll. Now he finds himself on a team with two other primary creators in and , in a Steve Kerr system that prioritizes ball and player movement over pick-and-roll -- often to the great despair of Dub Nation. One person not worried about the fit, however, is Curry. Coming off one of the best seasons of his storied career, Curry said on Thursday that he and Paul have played \"a lot\" of pickup this offseason, and the two are already thriving. \"It's mad fun,\" Curry said of playing next to Paul. \"I get the rebound and push, I can throw it ahead in transition knowing he's pretty sure with the ball. He makes the right decision. He's been really good catching and shooting when he's open, moving without the basketball. ... It's pretty seamless, really, to be honest.\" Paul is no stranger to playing with superstar guards, and history suggests that operating alongside Curry won't be a problem. In Paul's first year next to , and , the , and all had significant success when the duos shared the floor. James Harden (2017-18) 118.6 105.5 13.1 Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (2019-20) 117.1 109.7 7.4 Devin Booker (2020-21) 117.1 110.2 6.9 As you can see, the \"there's only one ball\" theory has never been an obstacle for Paul, who has become an elite spot-up shooter. He ranked in the 98th percentile in catch-and-shoot efficiency last season with the Suns, per Synergy Sports, and in the 94th percentile in spot-up situations. The guy knows how to get it done without the ball. The bigger issues, as Curry pointed out on Thursday, will come on the defensive end. With Paul standing at an even six-feet and Curry at 6-2, the duo could be challenged by some of the league's bigger, stronger guard pairings, and potentially hunted by opposing stars in a playoff setting. \"There's challenges in terms of how we match up, making sure we're defensively sound and how we play on that end of the floor and how we adapt with the other three guys that are out there with us, whoever that is,\" Curry said. \" ... You obviously have to rebound, and there's an attention to detail on mechanics and reads that can help us do our work early, so you're not just trying to get rebounds above the rim. Matchup-wise, it depends on the game, what the scouting report is. We'll be able to adapt to that.\" A nine-time All-Defensive selection, the aging Paul will rely on his basketball IQ and relentless tenacity to make up for whatever he's lost athletically. The 35-year-old Curry, meanwhile, has continued to add muscle and improve defensively over the latter half of his career. The two will also have the benefit of defensive stalwarts Green, and/or on the floor with them. Watching how Paul fits into a Warriors team seeking another title will be one of the most intriguing early storylines of the 2023-24 season, which begins on Oct. 24 when Golden State hosts Paul's most recent former team, the Phoenix Suns. (The first preseason game will be Saturday night, when the Warriors host the Los Angeles Lakers.) \"That's the beauty and the challenge of what we have in terms of our roster,\" Curry said. \"Because each five that you put out there is going to have a strength and they're going to have a weakness. You have to be able to adapt as we go through.\"",

    "description": "Trump accused Cohen of \"spreading falsehoods\" and causing \"reputational harm\" for talking about hush-money payments to women during Trump's 2016 campaign.",
    "content": "NEW YORK \u2014 Donald Trump dropped his $500 million lawsuit against Michael Cohen, his former lawyer and fixer who is now a key witness in a criminal case against him, Cohen and a Trump spokesperson said Thursday night. The former president did not waive his right to sue again. Trump accused Cohen of \"spreading falsehoods\" \"with malicious intent\" and causing \"vast reputational harm\" for talking publicly about hush-money payments made to women during Trump's 2016 campaign that are at the heart of criminal charges he faces in New York. Trump also accused Cohen of breaking a confidentiality agreement that he signed as a condition of his employment. The former president and GOP front-runner's decision comes days before he was set to give a deposition in the suit brought in April in Florida. That testimony was originally set for Oct. 3, but Trump rescheduled so he could attend the first three days of a separate New York civil fraud trial. Cohen is likely to testify in that trial next week. A Trump spokesperson said Trump decided \"to temporarily pause\" the suit against Cohen as he mounts another campaign for the White House and fights criminal charges in four separate jurisdictions, but said he would refile at a later date. \"Given that President Trump is required to sit for deposition in a civil matter on Columbus Day, when he is scheduled to be in the Great State of New Hampshire, and while the President is fighting against the meritless claims that have been lodged against him in New York, Washington D.C., Florida, and Georgia, as well as continuing his winning campaign \u2026 President Trump has decided to temporarily pause his meritorious claims against Michael Cohen,\" the spokesperson said in a statement. The spokesperson added that once Trump \"has prevailed in dealing with the witch hunts against him, he will continue to pursue his claims against Michael Cohen, who rightfully deserves to, and will be held accountable for his unlawful words and actions just as the Southern District of New York held him accountable for numerous non-Trump related acts and crimes, making Cohen a very 'proud' felon.\" Cohen celebrated the decision, calling the suit \"nothing more than a retaliatory intimidation tactic.\" \"Mr. Trump's cowardly dismissal spells the end of this latest attempt to deter me from providing truthful testimony against him,\" Cohen said in a statement. \"My legal team and I now look forward to turning our full attention to holding Mr. Trump accountable for his latest abuse of the legal system. More to come.\" The lawsuit, filed in Miami, offered a preview of arguments that are sure to be featured in Trump's defense against charges that he falsified internal business records to disguise payments made during the 2016 presidential campaign to silence claims of extramarital sexual encounters. Trump denied any wrongdoing.",

    "description": "Bears legend Dick Butkus dies at 80",
    "content": "Hall of Fame linebacker Dick Butkus, whose name became synonymous with the Chicago Bears and hard-nosed defense, has died, his family announced Thursday. Butkus was 80. \"The Butkus family confirms that football and entertainment legend Dick Butkus died peacefully in his sleep overnight at home in Malibu, California,\" the family said in a statement. \"The Butkus family is gathering with Dick's wife Helen. They appreciate your prayers and support.\" Additional information was not yet provided. The news came less than two hours before the Bears were slated to face the host Washington Commanders in a \"Thursday Night Football\" matchup. Fans at the Commanders' FedEx Field observed a moment of silence for Butkus before the game. \"Dick was the ultimate Bear, and one of the greatest players in NFL history,\" Bears chairman George McCaskey said in a statement. \"He was Chicago's son. He exuded what our great city is about and, not coincidentally, what George Halas looks for in a player: toughness, smarts, instincts, passion and leadership. \"He refused to accept anything less than the best from himself, or from his teammates. ... His contributions to the game he loved will live forever and we are grateful he was able to be at our home opener this year to be celebrated one last time by his many fans.\" NFL commissioner Roger Goodell said in a statement that Butkus \"helped define the linebacker position\" thanks to his intuition and toughness. Born in Chicago, Butkus built his memorable football career in his home state, becoming an All-American at Illinois before joining the Bears in 1965. Butkus became a two-time NFL Defensive Player of the Year (1969, 1970) and an eight-time Pro Bowl selection in a nine-year pro career before going on to work as a broadcaster, pitchman and actor. One popular tale of Butkus' toughness came from a game against the Green Bay Packers in 1970. Butkus was said to have hit Packers quarterback Bart Starr so ferociously that when Starr arose from the turf, he began walking to the wrong bench. Butkus played 119 games for the Bears, tallying 22 interceptions, 27 fumble recoveries and at least 11 sacks during an era when defensive statistics weren't closely kept. He is a member of both the College Football and Pro Football Halls of Fame and was named to the NFL's 100th anniversary team. The annual award for the top linebacker in college football is named after Butkus. \"Some people were made to be doctors, others to be lawyers,\" Butkus once said. \"I was made to play football.\" --Field Level Media Originally published on , part of the .",

    "content": "After director David Gordon Green revived the Halloween franchise with his trilogy of sequels, Universal tapped him to do the same thing with The Exorcist--make a direct sequel to the original film, and get a modern franchise going. And now we have The Exorcist: Believer , positioned as the first entry in a new trilogy (box office performance pending, presumably). Despite that franchise plan, Believer functions in a fairly standalone way, allowing for the possibility of continuing the story while also concluding things in a way that would work pretty well if they don't make any others. It's hard to talk about it in these vague terms, though--it's time to get spoilery. Warning: This article contains spoilers for the entire plot of The Exorcist: Believer, including the ending. The Exorcist: Believer plot recap Believer begins in Haiti, where Victor and his pregnant wife are on their honeymoon. But an earthquake strikes, and she's injured in a building collapse. The doctors tell Victor they can save the mom or the baby, but not both--and he has to choose. Cut to the present day. Victor has a 13-year-old daughter named Angela, and his wife is dead. Angela, naturally, is a little bit obsessed with her mother since she never knew her, and one day she swipes one of her mom's old earrings and goes into the woods with her friend Katherine to do some light ritualizing. They don't seem too serious about it, but the demons hear them anyway. The girls go missing without a trace, and then reappear a few days later in a barn, many miles away, thinking they'd only been gone a few hours. From there we get the standard demonic escalation. They seem relatively normal, but traumatized, at first, and then they gradually get ruder, cruder, and uglier as the demon's presence becomes more obvious in both Angela and Katherine. Victor calls up Chris McNeil, the mom from the original Exorcist. But she isn't able to do much to help aside from hearing some mean comments about her daughter Regan (the girl who was possessed in the original movie) and getting stabbed in both eyes by Katherine. Both things lay out the stakes and the reality of the possession, and so Victor, Katherine's family of evangelicals and their pastor, and some concerned neighbors (a Catholic woman and a Pentecostal man) prepare for the big, climactic exorcism scene. And in addition to the three varieties of Christian, Victor also recruits a pagan priestess to get in on it. There's no Catholic priest involved at first, though, because the local diocese forbade the neighborhood priest from participating. But he believes the possession is real, and as the exorcism begins, he's sitting outside, in his car, praying. Inside, things are going pretty poorly, and the good guys aren't really making any headway. The priest, sensing that, decides to show up and bring the power of Christ with him. So he pops in and starts issuing his rites on the demon-possessed girls. The movie indicates it's working, with the music rising triumphantly as the priest does the whole exorcism routine. But it's just a ruse--the demon doesn't care about the priest's rite of exorcism at all. And it demonstrates that by telekinetically causing the priest's head to turn all the way backwards until he is dead. What happens at the end of The Exorcist: Believer? From there, we get two major developments. First: The demon reveals that Victor told the doctors in Haiti all those years before to save his wife, not his daughter. But her injuries were too severe, and they ended up having to save Angela by default, against Victor's wishes in the moment. The second big thing: The demon says that Angela's and Katherine's parents get to choose which of the two girls gets to live, and which one has the unholy privilege of going back to Hell with the demon. Victor says nothing--he and Katherine's mom agree they can't make that choice, and decide to fight for both of them. But the demon says that if they don't choose, it will take them both. And after some more fun times with demons, Katherine's father gives into temptation and chooses her. From there, everything wraps up pretty quickly. It turns out the demon had tricked them--the one that was chosen would be the one who died, and the other would get to live. So Katherine's spirit is dragged to Hell, and Angela gets to live, just like what happened with Victor's choice all those years before. As horror movie endings go, that's a pretty good one--it's both viscerally disturbing in the moment, and then once those raw feelings fade, it's just depressing. That's great. But knowing that two sequels are on the way changes the perspective a little bit. It's not hard to imagine that this group will run afoul of more demons by trying to find a way to save Katherine from her damnation. That sequel, scheduled for 2025, is already subtitled \"Deceiver\"--a good title for a movie in which the characters wrestle with the consequences of being tricked in such a horrible way. The possibility that Katherine might return from her fate theoretically lessens the emotional impact of this ending, but we've still got a while before we find out anything about Deceiver. And it's likely that the unenthusiastic response to Believer from critics will inspire some kind of adjustment to whatever plans they may have already had for the story. But as it stands now: Angela is alive and recovering from her ordeal, and Katherine is in Hell. But with two more movies coming, it's hardly safe to assume the state of things will stay the same. Does The Exorcist: Believer have a mid-credits or post-credits scene? No, there aren't any extra scenes or any teases for future Exorcist movies during the credits. So once the credits get started, it's safe to head to the bathroom if you need to.",

    "description": "\u201cThe fight is not over and the work is not done.\"",
    "content": "Key figures of the Indigenous \u201cprogressive\u201d opposition to the Voice to Parliament announced this week they would vote Yes in the upcoming referendum to alter the constitution. The moves reflect growing concerns among Indigenous leaders that a national No vote would fuel racist right-wing action and sentiment in the country and inadvertently align their cause with No campaigners like One Nation\u2019s Pauline Hanson and Leader of the Opposition Peter Dutton. Progressive No activists, including First Nations Senator Lidia Thorpe\u2019s Blak Sovereignty Movement, have opposed the Voice in favour of more concrete action and argued for a Treaty-first approach. Thorpe is now one of the few in the movement who has stuck to this hardline stance. Her sister, co-campaigner on the Blak Sovereignty movement and Warriors of Aboriginal Resistance (War) co-founder Meriki Onus, publicly she would change her vote to Yes this week. Speaking with the Sydney Morning Herald, Onus while she agreed with much of the No position, she was now leaning towards voting Yes. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen an example in Australia where a body similar to the Voice to parliament already functions, and I think that they do really good work and there\u2019s amazing opportunity there. So I would be leaning towards a Yes,\u201d she said. WAR community organiser Tarneen Onus Browne has also changed their stance from No to Yes. They told VICE they feared the \u201cmental anguish\u201d caused by a national No vote would harmfully impact Indigenous peoples, as well as lead to the rise of the far-right in Australia. \u201cAs a Black Queer, we went through the plebiscite and it was horrific. The most harmful consequence would be that our people are just absolutely disempowered,\u201d they said. \u201cIt will be a leg up for the \u2018Racist No\u2019 campaign and confirm that they can run a campaign based on misinformation and disinformation and win a national campaign, and the rise of the right wing in Australia.\u201d The Melbourne-based activist said they initially wanted a No because they feared their \u201csovereignty would be compromised\u201d. \u201cI felt like Blackfulla didn't have a choice, and I knew this was happening to us and there was nothing we could do to change it. I saw an opportunity to send messages of strength about First Nations people because we've seen a lot of deficit in the media,\u201d they said. \u201cI have 'come out' to support my mum and dad and my auntys and uncles who are voting Yes to this and the hundreds of Blackfullas I have spoken to on the phone over the last few months.\u201d With the referendum approaching on October 14, other Indigenous leaders have acquiesced to a Yes vote. On Tuesday, Yorta Yorta rapper Briggs a No vote would \u201cdo nothing\u201d. \u201cI feel like it would set us back and does nothing to mend the already fragile and fragmented dialogue Australia already has with Indigenous people,\u201d he told Guardian Australia. \u201cYes is the only way to maintain this idea that we\u2019re still working towards a more unified country and society.\u201d Chief executive of Uprising of the People, Mililma May, the Sydney Morning Herald she had changed her vote to Yes after considering how a No vote would affect her community. \u201cThe idea of a No vote in the Northern Territory scared me in that it could mean a majority of Australians do not care about Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander voices. And that fundamentally felt wrong to me,\u201d she said. \u201cI realised that sovereignty can\u2019t be impacted by voting Yes. And I think it\u2019s healthy to have a level of mistrust of the government, but in a way that can make the government accountable.\u201d For Onus Browne, while a Yes vote isn\u2019t a \u201csilver bullet\u201d, if the public were to vote Yes, \u201cthen a wave of transformative change for First Nations justice will follow\u201d. \u201cPublic momentum and demand give governments a political mandate to act on bold policy reform. This is far from ideal but it is happening, and a No vote will have devastating effects on Indigenous and non-Indigenous communities alike,\u201d they said. \u201cOn their ballot papers, I ask settlers to write Yes to First Nations strength and leadership. And if it is a Yes, Non-Aboriginal people must resist the complacency and the slumber that often happens after historic moments. \u201cThe fight is not over and the work is not done. I ask that your Yes be a commitment too, continuing to support our campaigns, standing alongside us for our fights for justice, and joining us on the streets at our protests, because Yes isn\u2019t enough.\u201d",

    "content": "The entered Thursday night with a 14-game losing streak, the longest active streak in the league and in team history. However, the graciously allowed the visiting Bears to explode out to a 17-0 lead that became a 27-3 halftime edge . Bears wide receiver looked like the second coming of Jerry Rice with 230 receiving yards and three touchdowns, both career-highs which made him the first Chicago player with 200 or more receiving yards and three or more touchdowns in a game since Harlon Hill all the way back in 1954, 12 years before the start of the Era. Given the Bears offensive onslaught and that the Commanders defense has allowed 30 or more points in four straight games, tied for the longest stretch of Ron Rivera's head-coaching career, one of Washington's new owners has already had enough: Magic Johnson. \"Tonight the Commanders played with no intensity or fire,\" the Basketball Hall of Famer and Commanders limited owner . \"We didn't compete in the first half and got down 27-3 heading into halftime. It was too big of a hole to climb out of and that is why we ended up losing 40-20.\" Plays like the one below where Bears running back took a shotgun handoff up the middle for 16 yards on third-and-seven just before halftime probably contributed to raising Johnson's blood pressure during the game. The two highest total value contract on the Commanders payroll below to defensive tackles: (four years, $90 million) and (four years, $72 million). Seeing his team get run over despite the presence of both of those players likely annoys Johnson and the rest of the Commanders fanbase. Khalil Herbert: \u2705 Picked up the first down \u2705 Dragged the defenders for several extra yards on Prime Video Also available on The Bears outran the Commanders by 149 yards, 178 to 29, as Washington quarterback ended up as the team's leading rusher with 19 yards on four carries. According to , Washington dropped back to pass 55 consecutive times without a design run from midway through the second quarter through the end of the game. That marks the most for a team in a game since 2006, the start of PFF's database. Johnson won't be too pleased if he takes a closer look at Thursday's box score.",

    "description": "The brand's first car was launched in October 1955.",
    "content": "Suzuki, the multinational automobile and motorcycle manufacturer headquartered in Shizuoka, Japan, has reached a remarkable milestone by achieving a cumulative worldwide car sales figure of 80 million units by the end of August 2023. The manufacturer currently produces vehicles, bikes, outboard marine engines, and others in 15 production facilities around 10 countries. It sells its products in 184 nations across the globe. Of those 80 million cars delivered so far, 36 percent were sold in Japan, 10 percent in Europe, 13.5 percent in Asia, 32.6 percent in India, and 7.8 percent in the rest of the world. Suzuki 's journey to 80 million units began with the launch of Japan's first mass-production mini-vehicle, the Suzulight, in October 1955. The introduction of the Fronte 800 in 1965 marked the company\u2019s entry into the compact vehicle segment, further expanding its footprint in the global automobile market. Suzuki's reach extended beyond Japan with the start of overseas sales in 1959. In 1975, the company embarked on its first overseas automobile production venture in Pakistan, which marked the beginning of a series of successful overseas production expansions. Key milestones include the establishment of production bases in India in 1983 and Hungary in 1992. Among Suzuki's lineup of mostly small and compact vehicles, the Alto stands out as one of the brand\u2019s all-time hits. Launched in 1979, the model has accounted for a remarkable 20 percent of the 80 million units sold. \u201cWe are grateful to be favored by such many customers. Alto is our top-selling model, and it has played a very significant role in Suzuki\u2019s mini vehicles as well as in the history of the company itself. We will make further efforts to provide value that expresses our manufacturing core of \u201cSho, Sho, Kei, Tan, Bi (Smaller, Fewer, Lighter, Shorter, Beauty)\u201d by standing once again on the origin of \u201ccustomer-focused value\u201d, a spirit which has been passed on from our founder,\u201d Suzuki\u2019s president Osamu Suzuki comments. As the automaker celebrates its 80 million-unit milestone, it is also looking forward to the next generation of one of its most important modern models. The third-generation Suzuki Swift, introduced in 2016, is poised to make way for a next-generation model and ahead of the official unveiling, a concept car was showcased just a few days ago , hinting at what's to come. Suzuki's Future: While officially labeled a concept, this vehicle appeared to be a close preview of the forthcoming production model. Familiar yet evolved, the concept car introduced notable changes, including repositioned rear door handles, fixed glass in the rear doors, and a prominent character line extending from front to rear. Additionally, the \"Hybrid\" badge on the front fender and side mirror-mounted cameras hint at Suzuki's plans to offer an electrified powertrain for the car.",

    "description": "San Jose Sharks close preseason with a 4-3 loss to the Los Angeles Kings at Delta Center in Salt Lake City. Now it's decision time for Mike Grier and David Quinn",
    "content": "It\u2019s a forward line that might just be together for the San Jose Sharks\u2019 season-opening game next week against the Vegas Golden Knights. William Eklund probably wouldn\u2019t mind that birthday present one bit. Eklund started Thursday\u2019s preseason game against the Los Angeles Kings on a line with center Mikael Granlund and Luke Kunin and assisted on a game-tying goal by Thomas Bordeleau in the third period in the Sharks\u2019 4-3 overtime loss at the Delta Center in Salt Lake City. Eklund has now been impressive in three straight exhibition games and after spending most of last season in the AHL, may have just cemented his spot on the Sharks roster to start the regular season. NHL teams have to get their rosters down to 23 players by Monday and it\u2019s not a stretch to say that Eklund will be among the 13 or 14 forwards the Sharks carry into their season-opener next Thursday at home against the defending Stanley Cup champions. Eklund turns 21 that day. \u201cI thought he played another strong game,\u201d Sharks coach David Quinn said of Eklund. \u201cI really liked his game tonight. As we\u2019ve talked about, he\u2019s been trending in the right direction.\u201d Eklund just adds a certain dynamic presence and pizzazz that\u2019s lacking in other parts of the Sharks\u2019 lineup. There\u2019s also a work ethic and a motor that hasn\u2019t stopped for three straight games as he finished the preseason with one goal and two assists. He also killed penalties and was part of the Sharks\u2019 second power-play unit. Bordeleau\u2019s goal came at the 14:15 mark of the third period and was his second in as many preseason games. On the play, Bordeleau chased the puck behind the Kings\u2019 net before Eklund came to support. As Bordeleau went to the front of the net, Eklund found him with a nifty pass that the Michigan product deposited past Los Angeles goalie Pheonix Copley. Did the game clarify things in terms of who will make the team out of training camp, or complicate matters? \u201cI want it to be as complicated as it can be, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d Quinn said. \u201cBut it was going to be complicated regardless of tonight. We knew we were going to have hard decisions and we\u2019ll take the time to make those hard decisions here over the next few days.\u201d To help generate offense, the Sharks are having to get creative in certain areas now that they\u2019re without the services of Erik Karlsson. One of those adjustments, at least for the time being, is having five forwards compromise the first power play unit. The Sharks began to experiment with the unorthodox look in practice this week, gave it a go Thursday in their final game of the preseason, and saw some immediate results. Alexander Barabanov, stationed around the slot area, redirected a pass along the ice from Granlund past Copley at the 17:39 mark of the first period. The Sharks went 1-for-5 with the man advantage. On the first unit were Granlund, Barabanov, Mike Hoffman, Tomas Hertl, and Anthony Duclair. The second unit had forwards Eklund, Bordeleau, Filip Zadina, and Kevin Labanc, and also defenseman Matt Benning. There are plusses and minuses with the five-forward configuration. A positive is that it allows for some more skilled playmakers who are used to having the puck on their stick a chance to get creative. The negatives are that it can result in some dangerous moments for players when they don\u2019t have the puck. They\u2019re not necessarily used to skating backward or defending the net in their own end. Granlund played the role of the power play quarterback to some mixed results. \u201cFor the first time, I thought when we were in the zone, we did a lot of good things,\u201d Quinn said. \u201cWe\u2019ve just got to clean up the other aspects when we don\u2019t have the puck. We\u2019re going to have to play in the neutral zone and we\u2019re going to have to play in the D-zone from time to time and that\u2019s where it really got a little hairy. So, like we talked about when we did this, we\u2019re going t have to be patient, and we\u2019ll clean that up.\u201d Mario Ferraro went after Adrian Kempe in the second period after the Kings forward knocked down Zadina with a late shoulder-to-shoulder hit. But that wasn\u2019t the last scrum of the night. Benning, Zadina, and Kyle Burroughs got into it with Pierre-Luc Dubois, Kevin Fiala, and Mikey Anderson with 49 seconds left in the third period, bringing a rise out of the Delta Center crowd. Related Articles Quinn was asked if he was concerned that Burroughs may have come off the bench outside of what\u2019s allowed by NHL rules. Quinn, though, said Burroughs came on the ice during the course of a normal line change. Six misconduct penalties and four double-minors for roughing were handed out. The fact that the Sharks once again were all in there as a group pleased Quinn. \u201c(Burroughs) didn\u2019t come off the bench for that purpose. I know there was a line change,\u201d Quinn said. \u201cAnytime there\u2019s trouble, five guys have to go to defend each other. It\u2019s not about being the Broad Street bullies. It\u2019s about standing up for your teammate and giving pushback.\u201d",

    "description": "Plus: Here's how we stopped the complaints about our wedding.",
    "content": ": I have two children, ages 5 and 10. I have been a single mother for the past four years after a decade of abuse from their father and a resulting restraining order. The court awarded me sole custody of the children. Unfortunately, both children have their father\u2019s last name. I\u2019m ready to move forward with changing their last names to my surname because I am their mother and sole caregiver. The 5-year-old is too young to remember his father and is as excited as a 5-year-old can be about the change, but the 10-year-old has mixed feelings. I think it\u2019s better to do this change sooner rather than later, though I am cautious of the identity conflict a name change can bring. : You state that you want to move forward with this name change because you are your children\u2019s mother and sole caregiver, but your decision here should be more about them and less about you. I agree that your 10-year-old\u2019s feelings should very much be taken into account as you make this decision. Discuss this privately and maintain an attitude of patient listening. This child has already lost a lot, and holding onto the name might be a way of trying to stem the tide of these losses to maintain a sense of normalcy. Keep in mind that children of abusive parents often find ways to continue to love and long for them. Your 10-year-old may worry that losing the father\u2019s name means finally and forever losing the father. Do not drag their father as you discuss this, but emphasize that you would like all three of you to share the same surname. You might ask both children if they would like to use their father\u2019s surname as a middle name. Related Articles If your older child absolutely does not want to change the surname, do not apply pressure, and hold off on the name change for the younger child. Due to the circumstances here, these two children having different surnames from one another would set them apart in both large and subtle ways. : My mother and father are in their early 70s. I\u2019m very close with both of them. There have been changes to their health over time, with wearing hearing aids, walking more slowly, etc., and I\u2019ve noticed that my mother is getting a little more forgetful lately. The changes aren\u2019t earth-shattering, usually just repeating a recent question or forgetting an answer she\u2019s just received. What\u2019s the \u201cright\u201d way to deal with this when it happens? Do I say, \u201cYou just asked that\u201d Or, \u201cI just told you that?\u201d Or is the proper thing to do to just ignore the fact that it\u2019s repetitive and simply just answer the question again? I don\u2019t want to remind her that she\u2019s getting older. : Your mother knows she\u2019s getting older. She feels the passage of time in large and small ways \u2013 every day. And I have news for you: Getting older is not a bad or shameful topic that must be avoided. Getting older, quite simply, is the privilege of continuing to live in the world. The way to respond to your mother\u2019s forgetfulness is with the utmost patience, followed by a trip to the doctor. Losing one\u2019s memory is a deep and essential fear, and this fear can prevent people from seeking an early diagnosis or treatment for cognitive changes that might be treatable. Your mother\u2019s forgetfulness might be the result of a change of medication, a need for medication, or another treatable or benign cause. : This is in response to who was complaining about destination weddings. My husband and I married in Hawaii many years ago with only our children in attendance. Our families were upset they weren\u2019t invited, but we didn\u2019t want to burden everyone by inviting them to a wedding across the Pacific. So, over several months after our ceremony, we threw smaller wedding parties across the country. We called it our \u201cwedding tour\u201d and the tagline was \u201cbringing the party to you!\u201d It was easier for us and the kids to travel to several locations than it was to try and gather a couple hundred people all in one place. We showed the video of our ceremony, wore our wedding attire, had great food and music, and specified no gifts. The complaints about missing our wedding stopped. : This is great. Related Articles",

    "content": "Suki Waterhouse's boyfriend Robert Pattinson was \"so accepting\" when they moved in together. The couple have been dating since 2018 but they decided to take their relationship to the next level six months ago by setting up home together with the model/actress moving out of her solo apartment and into 'The Batman' star's home - and she says he was incredibly patient after she brought \"mess and chaos\" with her. Speaking on Apple\u2019s 'Driven Minds: A Type 7' podcast, she explained: \"I\u2019ve been having such a crushing weight of anxiety because I've moved. I wasn't there for the move, so everything just got boxed up and sent ... [It was a challenge because] because I've moved in with my boyfriend now, and I always used to live alone. \"It doesn't feel like that much of a crazy thing. And I'm very lucky because he is so accepting of the mess and the chaos. He never says anything about it. He kind of thinks it\u2019s like, charming. So I'm very lucky for that.\" Suki, 31, went on to add the relationship came along at the right time for her after previous bad experiences with men left her vowing to stay single. She said: \"I've been ghosted and broken up with after dating someone for a year, that was pretty bad. But it turned out to be brilliant because I took it like a bout of celibacy. \"[I dated people who were] just cheating on you all the time. It's really f***** up.\" However, she added of her romance with the 'Harry Potter' star: \"Maybe for me, it was about actually feeling ready in a way that I haven't before, that I actually had something to give. I've sat with myself - have been in a couple of different kinds of relationships. \"I actually have something to share now. I have, like, a life that I'm proud of that I want to share with someone and I'm stable and I have my s*** together.\"",

    "content": "Victoria Beckham's wedding dress flew across the Atlantic on Concorde four times. The Spice Girls star married former footballer David Beckham in a lavish ceremony at Luttrellstown Castle in Ireland in July 1999 and she wore a Champagne-coloured gown with an intricate corset which was a collaboration between Vera Wang and UK-based costumier Mister Pearl - and it meant the bodice had to whizz back and forth between New York and London many times. Vera told PEOPLE: \"I call it the transatlantic dress. That bodice flew back and forth four times on the Concorde. The actual under bodice was made by a very famous couture corsetiere named Mister Pearl, who works only out of London.\" She added of the corset-maker's styles: \"He makes corsets that have to be pulled [in] with these metal things, which is how corsets were done in the old days. It takes about 45 minutes to lace up, and it can take your waist down to literally 18 inches [like] Scarlett O'Hara. \"I could not live with that because I need to be comfortable, as I always say. But Victoria did.\" Vera added that she visited Victoria in London for one of the fittings, while the pop star also came to New York twice. However, the dress project had to be put on hold after Victoria discovered she was pregnant with her first child, son Brooklyn, and the wedding had to be delayed. Vera added: \"We delayed the wedding for two years. Then we resumed, or maybe a year and a half. So that is [what] I call the transatlantic wedding with Victoria and David.\" Victoria wore the custom gown for the ceremony and later changed into a bright purple dress - matching the groom's suit and baby Brooklyn's outfit. Speaking in his new Netflix documentary 'Beckham', David admitted he let Victoria make all the decisions when it came to organising their big day. He said: \"I tried to think back to when I decided to wear a purple suit. I don't know when that happened. I think I just took Victoria's lead on it. But what \u2026 what were we thinking?\" However, Victoria has no regrets over the glitzy ceremony, saying: \"It was fun! ... We weren't worried about what people were going to say. I mean Christ, how lovely to be that way when you just don't really care you just want to express yourselves.\"",

    "content": "Jamie Spears is \"severely ill\" in hospital. The showbiz patriarch - who was co-conservator over daughter Britney Spears' affairs for 13 years until September 2021 - has reportedly spent \"weeks\" in a medical facility receiving treatment for an infection. A source told the New York Post newspaper's Page Six column: \u201cJamie has been suffering with a bad infection that has required surgery. \"He has been hospitalized for weeks in a special infectious disease facility.\u201d A second insider told the outlet that Jamie is \"severely ill\", but suggestions he had been to rehab over the summer are untrue. In August, TMZ reported the 72 year old had been hospitalised \"several months\" earlier when doctors were concerned he had a problem with his kidney, but it turned out to be a \"terrible infection\" in his knee, 16 years after having the joint replaced. Insiders told the site at the time Jamie was preparing for more surgery, where doctors would try to clear the infection from the knee. He is said to be \"extremely thin\" after losing over 25lbs due to his medical issues. It was also claimed that Jamie's health problems had made Britney think about reconciling with her father, who she has been estranged from since her conservatorship - which she was highly critical of - ended. The 41-year-old pop star is currently in touch with just one member of her family \u2013 her older brother, Bryan Spears. The \u2018Baby One More Time\u2019 singer has stayed close to her older sibling Bryan throughout her long-running battle to free herself from her family\u2019s conservatorship over her life and $60 million, which was legally ended in April, and he temporarily moved in with her in the Los Angeles mansion she shared with her estranged husband Sam Asghari, 29. A source told Page Six: \u201cHe\u2019s been staying over and helping her alongside a therapist.\u201d The insider added Bryan\u2019s presence \u201ca great thing for all of\u201d Britney\u2019s family. Britney briefly reunited with her mother Lynne Spears, 68, in May, but sources told the outlet there is \u201cstill a lot of hurt there\u201d and they \u201chaven\u2019t quite reconciled\u201d.",

    "content": "Travis Kelce's mom feels she is in an \"alternate universe\" hanging out with Taylor Swift. The NFL star is believed to have been romancing the 'Bad Blood' hitmaker for the last few months and the 33-year-old pop star has been spending time with his mother Donna Kelce watching his Kansas City Chiefs games, and the matriarch admitted it has been a surreal experience getting so much public attention. Appearing on the 'Got It From My Momma' podcast, Donna said: \u201cI feel like I\u2019m in an alternate universe, because it\u2019s something I\u2019ve never been involved with before.\" Donna admitted the last few weeks have been a \"whirlwind\" and she is surprised the speculation surrounding Travis and Taylor's rumoured relationship has yet to die down. She said: \u201cI thought it would be over at that point, but it seems to just continue, and every week just seems to trump the week before. \u201cSo it\u2019s really kind of wild, a wild ride.\u201d But Donna thinks it is \"pretty cool\" that some young girls have developed an interest in football as a result of Taylor's appearances in the crowd and admitted the NFL have been cashing in on the attention. She said: \u201cAll I can tell you is that the NFL is laughing all the way to the bank. You know what I\u2019m saying? Good for them. They\u2019re getting the ramifications of everything. \u201cI can tell you this, that they\u2019ve told me personally that the Kelce family has done more good PR for football than they could have paid a $1 million to a PR firm.\u201d Donna's comments came after Travis, 33, and his brother Jason, 35, joked they had been \"put on the map\" because of the 'Lover' singer. The brothers announced on Wednesday (04.10.23) their \u2018New Heights\u2019 podcast has reached No1 across various platforms thanks to what\u2019s been called the \u201cTaylor effect\u201d. Philadelphia Eagles star Jason said: \u201cWe are officially on the map. Both Travis and I have officially been put on the map.\u201d Travis replied: \u201cJust when you think you been skatin\u2019 away from it.\u201d Crediting Taylor for the uplift in their numbers, Jason joked: \u201cNothing out of the ordinary from week tree, so can\u2019t really explain why the boost in viewership, but we appreciate you guys tuning in.\u201d",

    "description": "Mickel Cherry faces one count of capital murder and one count each of first-degree murder and rape in the death of Zoey Felix.",
    "content": "A 25-year-old man was charged Thursday in the rape and killing of a 5-year-old Kansas girl who died despite firefighters' efforts to save her life in a gas station parking lot. Mickel Cherry faces one count of capital murder - which would allow prosecutors to seek the death penalty - and one count each of first-degree murder and rape in the on Monday. He was jailed in Topeka on a $2 million bond, and his next court appearance has not yet been determined. Shawnee County District Attorney Michael Kagay told reporters that a decision about seeking a death sentence won't be made until after a preliminary hearing to determine whether Cherry stands trial. That is standard in capital cases. Mark Manna, of the Kansas Death Penalty Defense Unit, said his office would represent Cherry, but that he had no further comment. Cherry's family didn't respond to messages. Authorities have released no details about the cause of Zoey's death, but former neighbors of the girl and her family believe she, her father and Cherry had lived the past few weeks in a grove of trees on a wooded lot near the gas station, just blocks from the home where her mother lived. They believed she was carried from the wooded lot to the gas station, but police have not confirmed any of those details. Kagay said in a news release that Topeka police rushed to a gas station where fire crews were attempting to save Zoey's life. She was later pronounced dead. A medical examination at the hospital revealed injuries consistent with sexual assault. \"I think the investigation into the murder and rape of this 5-year-old girl is fairly complete,\" Kagay told reporters during a brief news conference. Asked about potentially charging other people, Kagay said, \"I'm willing to consider any actionable investigations brought to me,\" but when he was asked whether he is aware of any other investigations, he said, \"I'm not.\" Timothy Phelps, deputy director of the Shawnee County Department of Corrections, confirmed that Cherry used to live at the same address as Zoey, but at the time of his arrest, Cherry was homeless. Cherry has no criminal record in Kansas, but he does have a misdemeanor criminal trespass conviction in Amarillo, Texas. Neighbors said they had raised concerns that Zoey's family home had no electricity and that they called the police and child welfare. \"She just had a good spirit to her. Honestly, very outgoing, smart. She was curious about everything. She'd ask you a 1,001 questions, and she demanded answers for those too,\" said Shaniqua Bradley, a neighbor. Neighbor Desiree Myles that Zoey was a \"loving girl.\" \"Love the children, all the kids play with her,\" she told the station. \"They all looked out for everybody, looked out for Zoey. She was a Curious George with nowhere to go. Nowhere to go.\" Topeka police confirmed Thursday that they made three visits to the home in September: one on Sept. 5 for a welfare check following a report that the home had no electricity; and two domestic disturbance calls in the afternoon and evening of Sept. 19, a little more than an hour apart. Police did not provide details about those two calls. City spokeswoman Gretchen Spiker said in an email that during the first call officers confirmed there was no electricity and that they were told the child wasn't staying there. Police met with the child, saw she was in \"good spirits\" but still made a report to child welfare and property officials, Spiker said. Kansas Department of Children and Families leaders for their lack of intervention following reports from police, WIBW reported. The city moved to condemn the house but backed off when the utilities were turned back on. Neighbors said that everyone but the mother had moved out by then. One tent and a tarp were set up in the woods a few blocks away from the home, in an area about a football field away from the pumps at a Dillons grocery store where fire crews tried to resuscitate Zoey. Her dad worked at the gas station; a coworker said Wednesday that he was taking time off and the company hasn't responded to an email from The Associated Press. A makeshift memorial of flowers, balloons and toys sat nearby. A held a candlelight vigil on Wednesday night to support survivors of sexual assault, WIBW reported.",

    "content": "The round bottom of a proper wok is the key to a decent stir fry, but it also makes it hard to use on traditional Western stoves. That\u2019s why many woks end up in a dark kitchen cabinet, unused and unloved. But wait; it turns out that the round bottom of a wok is \u2014 radio waves, specifically the 21-cm neutral hydrogen emissions coming from the heart of our galaxy. Turning a wok into an entry-level radio telescope doesn\u2019t appear to be all that hard, at least judging by what [Leo W.H. Fung] detail in (PDF) on \u201cWTH\u201d or \u201cWok the Hydrogen.\u201d Aside from the wok, which serves as the main reflector, you\u2019ll need a bit of coaxial cable and some stiff copper wire to fashion a small dipole antenna and balun, plus some plastic tubing to support it at the focal point of the reflector. Measuring the wok\u2019s shape and size, which in turn determines its focal point, is probably the hardest part of the build; luckily, the paper includes tips on doing just that. The authors address the controversy of parabolic versus spherical reflectors and arrive at the conclusion that for a radio telescope fashioned from a wok, it just doesn\u2019t matter. As for the signal processing chain, WTH holds few surprises. A Nooelec Sawbird+ H1 acts as preamp and filter for the 1420-MHz hydrogen line signal, which feeds into an RTL-SDR dongle. Careful attention is paid to proper grounding and shielding to keep the noise floor as low as possible. Mounting the antenna is a decidedly ad hoc affair, and aiming is as simple as eyeballing various stars near the center of the galactic plane \u2014 no need to complicate things. Performance is pretty good: WTH measured the recession velocity of neutral hydrogen to within 20 km/s, which isn\u2019t bad for something cobbled together from scrap. We\u2019ve seen plenty of before, but WTH probably wins the \u201cget on the air tonight\u201d award. Thanks to [Heinz-Bernd Eggenstein] for the tip.",

    "content": "Apple rolled out iOS 17.0.3 earlier this week, a release that brings over fixes for the overheating problems that some iPhone 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max users reported since the handsets were released. The software patch doesn\u2019t reduce the performance of the powerful A17 Pro, just like said. We already saw that prove that. Sign up for the most interesting tech & entertainment news out there. By signing up, I agree to the and have reviewed the But does the software fix actually solve the overheating issue? Thermal testing performed before and after the iOS 17.0.3 shows the iPhone 15 Pros aren\u2019t getting hot after the fix. That\u2019s exactly the kind of news we\u2019ve been expecting. iPhone 15 Pro users who ran into overheating issues described various scenarios where the handset would overheat. One concerns the A17 Pro chip running high-end games. The new Pros also overheated while the battery was charging. Or while owners used them as the phones were connected to a charger. Like other reviewers, ran into an overheating issue involving fast charging. The blog used a thermal camera to measure the temperature. It recorded a 107.1\u00baF temperature when the handset charged with a 35W charging brick. The iPhone 15 officially supports 20W fast charging, but unofficially it can approach 30W speeds. You can recharge the iPhone with any USB-C charger that exceeds 20W power to take advantage of even faster charging. also found the handset to overheat while jumping between camera apps while shooting content outdoors on an 82\u00baF day. Apple explained that an iOS 17 bug and issues with certain third-party apps could lead to overheating. The company said the titanium frame and the USB-C port were not responsible for the extra heat. After applying the iOS 17.0.3 update, retested the iPhone 15 Pro models. They used the same parameters and equipment, as well as the same location as earlier tests. This time, the did not exceed 93.8\u00baF while charging with the same 35W charger. also notes that other iPhone and Android phones reach temperatures between 85\u00baF and 95\u00baF when fast charging. The Galaxy Fold 5 was the hottest, with a temperature of 98.7\u00baF. This is just one test involving a thermal camera, but it seems the iOS 17.0.3 patch fixed the iPhone 15 Pro overheating issues. Like before, I\u2019ll warn you that you might experience overheating during intensive gaming sessions. But that\u2019s normal behavior for any smartphone. What\u2019s important here is for the iPhone to continue to be comfortable to use even during long gaming sessions.",

    "description": "More than a third of credit cards now carry APRs of nearly 30%. But to get a lower rate, often all you have to do is ask.",
    "content": "Credit card interest rates have soared to levels usually reserved for people with severely damaged credit. Indeed, more than one in three cards carry annual percentage rates (APRs) of 29.99% or higher, according to an analysis by LendingTree. The average interest rate on a new credit card offer is up to 24.45% \u2014 the highest level since the online lending marketplace began tracking interest rates across 200 cards. The upshot: Not paying your credit card balance each month adds up fast. \"There are very few things in life that are more expensive than having crummy credit,\" LendingTree credit analyst Matt Schulz told CBS MoneyWatch. \"It will cost you thousands of dollars over the course of your life in the form of higher interest rates, more fees on mortgage and car loans, and it can push your insurance premiums higher.\" How to return gifts purchased using buy now, pay later plans 3 ways to cut your credit card debt A card's APR determines how much interest the cardholder will be charged if they don't pay off their balance in full at the end of each month. The good news is that if you pay your balance in full each month, these rates don't go into effect. \"But that's not the reality for a whole lot of cardholders in this country,\" Schulz said. \"However, if you have decent credit, there are options you have to potentially improve your interest rates.\" Can I get a lower rate? For folks struggling with debt, consider a card that offers 0% interest on balance transfers for an introductory period. Also reach out to your credit card issuer and ask for a lower interest rate. A LendingTree survey from earlier this year found that 76% of people who asked for a lower rate got one. The average reduction was roughly six percentage points. Are medical credit cards worth it? 03:14 \"It can be scary to pick up the phone and negotiate with a giant bank, but your chances of success are better than you realize,\" Schulz said. And as always, Improve your credit score by paying your bills on time, keeping your balance as low as possible and not applying for too much credit too often, Schulz said.

    "description": "The U.N. human rights office says \"indications are that it was a Russian missile\" that struck Ukrainians gathered to mourn a fallen soldier.",
    "content": "Families in the small northeast Ukrainian village of Hroza were trying to process horror and loss Friday morning after a Russian rocket strike hit a grocery store and caf\u00e9 , killing at least 51 of the town's remaining 300 or so inhabitants. Thousands of people had already fled the Kharkiv region, where Hroza is located, close to the Russian border, since Russian President Vladimir Putin launched his full-scale assault on Ukraine in February 2022. Dozens of people, including children, had gathered Thursday afternoon for a wake to remember a fallen soldier's life, when their own lives were suddenly cut short by the rocket strike. \"We only found bits and pieces of some bodies,\" said Kharkiv's chief police investigator Serhii Bolvinov. A teddy bear and flowers are seen placed on rubble as Ukrainian emergency personnel clear debris at the site of a Russian strike that hit a shop and caf\u00e9 in the village of Groza, in Ukraine's Kharkiv region, Oct. 6, 2023. GENYA SAVILOV/AFP/Getty Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned the \"demonstrably brutal Russian crime\" and vowed that his own forces would \"respond to the terrorists\" powerful.\" There was another missile attack Friday in the city of Kharkiv, only about 50 miles northwest of Hroza, which killed a 10-year-old boy and his grandmother, Ukraine's Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko said on the Telegram messaging app. Associated Press journalists said they saw emergency crews pulling the boy's body, wearing Spider-Man pajamas, from a building destroyed in the early morning strike. \"Indications are that it was a Russian missile.\" Elizabeth Throssell, spokeswoman for the United Nations human rights office, told journalists Friday in Geneva that while it was \"very difficult to establish with absolute certainty what happened\" in Hroza, \"given the location, given the fact that the caf\u00e9 was struck, the indications are that it was a Russian missile.\" The office of Volker Turk, the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), deployed a field team on Friday \"to speak to survivors and gather more information\" on the attack, with a spokesperson for his office saying he was \"profoundly shocked and condemns these killings.\" The missile strike was the bloodiest single attack in 16 months and it came as a poll showed U.S. public support for sending more aid to Ukraine falling \u2014 down 5% since the summer to 41%. With additional U.S. funding for Ukraine currently frozen amid the ongoing federal budget battle in Washington, Ukrainian congresswoman Oleksandra Ustinova told CBS News she was \"100% worried\" about the future of American support for her country, as it battles to fend off Russia's 20-month-long, full-scale invasion. \"The most needed types of weapons right now for us is the air defense missiles,\" she told CBS News. \"If we don't have any more of those coming, we would have hundreds and thousands of civilians dead this winter.\" Any additional defenses that could have bolstered the chances of survival in the village of Hroza will come too late. Russia considers bailing on nuclear test ban treaty The speaker of Russia's lower house of parliament, meanwhile, has echoed Putin's own remarks, saying the country's lawmakers would \"definitely discuss the issue of revoking ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty\" during their next session. \"This is in line with the national interests of our state,\" said State Duma speaker Vyacheslav Volodin, calling it \"a mirror response to the United States, which has not yet ratified the treaty.\" The U.S. did sign onto the treaty banning nuclear weapons tests in 1996, but Congress has never ratified it. Putin said Thursday that, \"theoretically, it is possible to revoke ratification\" of the treaty, which Russia's government ratified in 2000.

    "description": "Kaleb Elarms-Orr is second in the Pac-12 in tackles in his first season as a starter with the Cal Bears after the Moreau Catholic High product played sparingly as a freshman in 2022.",
    "content": "BERKELEY \u2014 Even before there was any tangible evidence suggesting it might happen, Cal inside linebacker Kaleb Elarms-Orr has always had confidence he will someday play in the NFL. He believed it at Moreau Catholic High School in Hayward, where he was a three-star prospect at a different position, projected to play on the edge or outside linebacker. He believed it his freshman season at Cal, even while rehabbing a torn ACL he suffered during a spring 2021 senior season at Moreau. And he kept the faith last fall as an anonymous special teams player. \u201cI always believed in myself. Always believed that I was going to do good things,\u201d Elarms-Orr said. \u201cI knew I had tools to be somewhat good. I\u2019ve just got to keep working hard. \u201cNot to be cocky or overly confident, but I\u2019m confident in what I do. I\u2019ve always believed I could make the NFL, it\u2019s just a matter of time.\u201d He\u2019s not there yet, but from zero tackles in 10 games as a third- or fourth-stringer a year ago, the 6-foot-2, 230-pound redshirt sophomore is No. 2 in the Pac-12, averaging 9.4 tackles through five games. He comes off a career-high 15 tackles vs. Arizona State and had 13 against Auburn several weeks back. Elarms-Orr and the Bears (3-2, 1-1 Pac-12) will get a stiff test Saturday night at Memorial Stadium against No. 15 Oregon State (4-1, 1-1), which boasts a top running back in 2022 Pac-12 Freshman of the Year Damien Martinez and a veteran offensive line. \u201cThat\u2019s really the engine of the whole operation,\u201d Cal defensive coordinator and inside linebackers coach Peter Sirmon said the Beavers\u2019 offensive line. \u201cThere\u2019s no dents in the armor.\u201d \u201cTheir line\u2019s good,\u201d Elarms-Orr confirmed. \u201cYou can tell they\u2019re very well-coached. They\u2019re going to work hard and be fast and be physical. We\u2019ve got to be the same as a defense.\u201d Elarms-Orr is most often answering the call so far in his first full season as a position player for the Bears. \u201cI know he\u2019s gaining confidence because he is producing,\u201d Cal coach Justin Wilcox said. \u201cI hope, like we do, he sees he\u2019s not close to his ceiling and if he reaches it then he could be a really good player. \u201cHe\u2019s still young and he\u2019s still learning but it\u2019s great to be learning when you\u2019re having that much production.\u201d Elarms-Orr says he\u2019s taking it game by game, trying not to focus on stats but merely doing what he can to help the Bears win. He said it\u2019s a been a huge benefit having Jackson Sirmon, a fifth-year senior and All-Pac-12 player, lining up next to him inside. \u201cI\u2019m learning from my mistakes every game \u2014 what to do and what not to do,\u201d he said. He made one in the first quarter during Cal\u2019s 24-21 win over ASU last week, misreading a play that allowed wide receiver Melquan Stovall to gain 34 yards after a short pass completion. Elarms-Orr declined to lean on inexperience as an excuse. \u201cI could have been better at handling the route \u2014 that\u2019s not on anybody else but me. I\u2019m going to definitely learn from that.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve got to clean that up. I think we can. He has the ability to do these things,\u201d said Wilcox, describing Elarms-Orr as explosive, tough and fast. Peter Sirmon says the dramatic improvement is the result of Elarms-Orr dedicating himself to learning the position last offseason. That involved hours watching tape to better understand what he was seeing. \u201cWhat he did in the winter and what we saw in the spring kind of catapulted him into what he\u2019s doing now,\u201d Sirmon said. \u201cI\u2019m not actually that surprised by his production. He has very, very good tools. \u201cAs he develops, the thing he can\u2019t rush is just getting more experience.\u201d Elarms-Orr concedes he\u2019s something of a perfectionist, which can be a double-edged sword as he continues to ascend. \u201cI feel like I can improve everything,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m just very hungry. I\u2019m striving to be the best.\u201d",

    "description": "Autumn brings pears. We\u2019ve been missing them. For a stellar dessert, poach them and let them steep in a bright yellow saffron-ginger syrup.",
    "content": ", Most of the time, I take a very casual approach to having guests for dinner. I don\u2019t mind doing a little cooking while people hang out in the kitchen; in fact, I enjoy it. But sometimes, it\u2019s more relaxing to have the entire menu ready, especially if some of it can be cooked a day in advance. This is one of those menus. It takes a little work to put together, but comes with great reward: There\u2019s barely any last-minute fussing. In Morocco \u2014 and similarly throughout the Middle East \u2014 the most delicious salads are made with seasoned, cooked vegetables, not leafy greens. For a first course, I made a smoky eggplant salad with cilantro, infused with cumin, hot pepper and a generous amount of olive oil. It\u2019s a winning combination. Seriously blackening the eggplants \u2014 preferably very firm ones, with fewer seeds \u2014 under the broiler achieves the perfect smoky flavor. Once they collapse from the intense heat, you scrape away the charred skin, then shred and dress the steamed flesh. The salad will keep, refrigerated, for several days. Serve at room temperature with radishes, olives and a crusty loaf or toast. For an impressive make-ahead main course, I wanted a savory vegetable pie, modeled after the classic Moroccan b\u2019stilla, usually made with squab, pigeon or chicken. It isn\u2019t traditional, of course, but this vegetarian version is quite delicious, flaky, buttery and fragrant with spices. The filling here is made with a highly seasoned pairing of butternut squash and plenty of caramelized onion, currants, fried almonds and ras el hanout, a Moroccan mix of warm spices. A diced preserved lemon adds perfume and sharpness, but you can also use a regular lemon. Traditional b\u2019stilla has a layer of scrambled egg, replaced here with a mixture of thick yogurt and feta. As with the original, everything is encased in golden, crisp buttered phyllo, sprinkled with powdered sugar and cinnamon and served piping hot. As a bonus, the pie may be assembled and refrigerated unbaked, for up to two days. Autumn brings pears. We\u2019ve been missing them. For a stellar dessert, poach them and let them steep in a bright yellow saffron-ginger syrup. Saffron, though burdened with a reputation of being \u201cthe most expensive spice in the world,\u201d is a spice you need in your cupboard. A little goes a long way: A quarter teaspoon will not break the bank, and you can often find small containers of saffron threads more affordably at an Indian or Middle Eastern grocery. You can poach your pears several days ahead of serving and store them in their syrup; they\u2019ll only improve in flavor. Served chilled with a dab of creme fraiche or a scoop of vanilla ice cream, this dessert is sheer luxury. Autumn light, autumn air, autumn gathering. Breathe it in. By David Tanis 6 servings 30 minutes, plus at least 15 minutes\u2019 cooling 1. Heat a broiler or grill to high. Using the tip of a sharp knife, poke the eggplant skin in a few places to prevent them from bursting. Broil or grill the whole eggplants, occasionally turning with tongs, until the skins blacken all over and start to collapse \u2013 they should be very soft when probed with a fork, about 10 to 15 minutes. 2. Carefully cut hot eggplants in half vertically, and leave to cool cut side up on a baking sheet or cutting board for at least 15 minutes. 3. In a small bowl, using a fork, whisk together olive oil, lemon juice, garlic and cumin. Season with salt and pepper. 4. Remove and discard the charred eggplant skin, scraping with a small knife. Cut off and discard stem end of eggplant. Tear or slice eggplant into 1 1/2-by-1/2-inch strips. Discard any large seed pockets. Place strips in a bowl. 5. Season eggplant with salt and pepper. Add dressing, cilantro and minced pepper. Toss gently and let sit for at least 10 minutes. Transfer to a serving platter, sprinkle with a pinch of red-pepper flakes and garnish with sprigs of cilantro. Serve at cool room temperature. Accompany with radishes and olives, if desired, and top with cilantro sprigs. By David Tanis 6 to 8 servings 2 hours, plus 15 minutes\u2019 resting 1. Heat 3 tablespoons olive oil in a skillet over medium-high. Add almonds and fry gently for about 2 minutes, until fragrant and beginning to brown. Set aside to cool, then rough chop in a food processor (or hand chop) and season with salt. Set aside. 2. In a Dutch oven or heavy skillet, warm remaining 1/4 cup olive oil over medium-high heat. Add onion and cook, stirring, until lightly browned and softened, about 10 minutes. 3. Add squash, season well with salt and pepper, and stir to coat. Add 1/2 cup water, cover pot and cook until squash is tender, about 10 minutes. 4. Add currants, chopped lemon, cumin, turmeric, ras el hanout and cayenne, and mix gently to incorporate. Transfer mixture to a baking sheet and spread out to allow to cool to room temperature. Taste and adjust seasoning. It should be highly seasoned. (The filling can be made up to 2 days in advance, covered and refrigerated. Allow to come to room temperature before continuing.) 5. Heat the oven to 375 degrees. 6. Build the pie: Using a pastry brush, butter a 9-inch springform pan. Lay a sheet of phyllo across the pan and press down so it covers the bottom and the edges overhang. Paint or drizzle more butter over the sheet, including the overhang. Layer another sheet over, slightly rotated, and press down. Continue until you have a total of 6 sheets, rotating slightly and buttering each layer, leaving the edges overhanging. 7. Spread bottom of pan with the reserved chopped almonds, then spoon in squash mixture and spread to an even thickness. Beat the eggs into the yogurt, then pour over squash mixture and top with feta. 8. Cover with 4 more sheets of phyllo dough, buttering between layers. Gather overhanging sheets, a few layers at a time, folding them to the center and pressing down to smooth (it\u2019s OK if the top sheets crack a little). Lightly butter the top. Pie may now be refrigerated for up to 2 days, or proceed with baking. 9. Place the pan on a foil-lined baking sheet. Bake for 45 minutes to 1 hour, until crisp and golden. Let rest at least 15 minutes. 10. To serve, unmold and dust top generously with powdered sugar. Sprinkle with pinches of cinnamon. By David Tanis 6 servings 45 minutes, plus overnight cooling 1. Peel the pears, leaving stems intact. 2. Put wine, sugar, saffron and ginger in a stainless-steel saucepan or skillet just large enough to hold the pears in a single layer over high heat. Stir and bring to a boil. 3. Add pears and reduce to a simmer. Cover and cook gently for about 20 minutes (turning occasionally if the pears aren\u2019t fully submerged), until pears are just tender when poked with a skewer or a small, sharp knife. If time permits, allow pears to cool in their syrup in the refrigerator, preferably overnight or for up to several days. 4. Remove pears from syrup. Simmer syrup down to a thick glaze over brisk heat, about 15 minutes. Let cool slightly (about 10 minutes) and pour over pears to serve. Pair with creme fraiche or vanilla ice cream.",

The likes of Bella Heathcote ( Bloom ), Bryan Brown ( Bloom ), Erik Thomson ( Black Snow ), Ben O\u2019Toole ( Hacksaw Ridge ), Lincoln Younes ( After the Verdict ), Alexander England ( Black Snow ) appear alongside Penn, Gurry and Fox in the show. \u201cWhen you grow up down under in Australia, dreaming of someday telling stories on screen, Cannes, holds a magical, almost mythical place in your creative heart, like Valhalla or heaven,\u201d said Gurry. \u201cTo be invited to Mipcom to speak about this project is truly an unimaginable honour and a thrill beyond words. Europe\u2019s history of storytelling is baked into every stone in its streets and every brick on its ancient monuments, you can hear the whispers of great story tellers from literally thousands of years ago\u2026 I cannot wait to add a few whispers to that rich history.\u201d \u201cFremantle is delighted to showcase C*A*U*G*H*T at MIPCOM and welcome these incredible international talents onto the iconic global stage where in a world first will together discuss this remarkably bold, ambitious, and highly entertaining series. Matthew, Sean, and Kick in Cannes presenting C*A*U*G*H*T is a must-see event,\u201d said Jens Richter, CEO Commercial and International at Fremantle, commented: Billed as \u201cthe mother of all entertainment content markets,\u201d the 39 th edition of MIPCOM CANNES (16-October 2023) will gather more than 10,000 senior international television producers, buyers, commissioners and creatives from the industry\u2019s major studios and platforms worldwide. More than 250 exhibiting studios and distributors from 45 countries are confirmed for the annual International Co-Production and Entertainment Content Market. In Cannes, Fremantle will also be launching Alice & Jack , the Channel 4 and Masterpiece drama starring Andrea Riseborough and Domhnall Gleeson, and will hold a special presentation on Neighbours , following its dramatic demise and rise this year. Exec producer Jason Herbison and stars Annie Jones and Tim Kano will discuss the power of IP to streamers, and how fans helped saved the hit series. Amazon\u2019s Freevee revived the show and rebooted it earlier this year after Channel 5\u2019s decision to ditch its investment in the long-running Australian soap led to a cancellation. The 39th Mipcom runs from October 16-19, with more than 250 exhibiting studios and distributors from 45 countries expected to attend.",

    "description": "An experienced trail runner who is familiar with the park, Chad Pallansch set out Sept. 27 on what was intended to be a one-day, 28-mile loop.",
    "content": "A rugged section of Rocky Mountain National Park has been closed during the search for a trail runner missing for more than a week. The area of about 5 square miles was made off limits to the public starting at 6 p.m. Thursday, Oct. 5, to minimize scent distractions for dogs being used in the search for Chad Pallansch, said officials at the Colorado park. An experienced trail runner who is familiar with the park, Pallansch, 49, set out Sept. 27 on what was intended to be a one-day, 28-mile loop out of Grand Lake. The last contact from him was a text message he sent around noon indicating he was almost to the 13,310-foot summit of Mount Alice \u2014 his intended high point, and about 10 miles into the loop. Though much of his route was in remote and even trailless high country, had he made it 17 miles he would have been close to Bear Lake, a popular day trip destination. Pallansch was reported overdue on Sept. 28, and park rangers found his vehicle parked at a trailhead near Grand Lake. The closure area, just west of Longs Peak, includes Mount Alice, McHenrys Peak and the upper end of the North Inlet drainage. Wintry weather, including snow and strong winds, has hindered the search this week, park officials reported. On Tuesday, Trail Ridge Road \u2014 the park\u2019s highway over the Continental Divide \u2014 was closed because of snow and ice. Pallansch is believed to have been dressed for temperatures in the 40s. He carried a navigation device but without emergency communication capability. Pallansch lives in Fort Collins, a 90-mile drive from Grand Lake. His social media profiles say he works as a software engineer at Hewlett-Packard.",

    "description": "Jackman is writing this book now 'because he\u2019s finally (being) honest with himself and (his) divorce' from Deborra-Lee Furness, a source says in a new report.",
    "content": "Hugh Jackman reportedly has some \u201cbombshell\u201d secrets about his life that he plans to share in a new memoir he\u2019s been working on since he and his wife Deborra-Lee Furness announced their split after 27 years of marriage. Thursday that the Australian actor, 54, is in the early stages of writing a tell-all book, a process that has been \u201chealing\u201d for him as the book promises to deliver some \u201cbombshell\u201d revelations. \u201cThe content will be Hugh speaking about his life,\u201d a source told Us Weekly. \u201cHe\u2019ll be opening up about his life like never before.\u201d Fans, of course, will wonder what these \u201cbombshell\u201d revelations involve. Could the \u201cX-Men\u201d actor open up about the reasons that he and Furness, 67, split? Yes, according to Us Weekly, whose source said: \u201cHugh\u2019s choosing to (write this book) now because he\u2019s finally (being) honest with himself (and his) divorce\u201d and \u201cthis book is the first step.\u201d In April, Jackman and Furness celebrated their anniversary and Jackman had posted a gushing tribute to his wife on Instagram, \u201cI love you Deb. Today is our 27th wedding anniversary. 27 years! I love you so much,\u201d the actor wrote in his caption. But five months later, news broke about their divorce, and about how Jackman and Furness\u2019 marriage had been a \u201csham\u201d all along. Over the years, the couple have responded to persistent speculation that Jackman is secretly gay. They often have used humor to push back against such \u201cmean-spirited\u201d gossip, as Furness has called it. Page Six reported that the divorce was \u201ca long time coming,\u201d while Jackman and Furness essentially said they had been growing apart. That\u2019s often the case with longtime couples, with \u2014 divorce after the age of 50 \u2014 a growing trend in the United States. \u201cWe have been blessed to share almost three decades together as husband and wife in a wonderful, loving marriage,\u201d the couple said in a statement said. \u201cOur journey now is shifting and we have decided to separate to pursue our individual growth.\u201d The Australian couple, who have long lived in New York City, are divorcing as their youngest child turns 18, which also is common in so-called gray divorces, Together, they share a son, Oscar, 23, and daughter, Ava, 18. Us Weekly furthermore hinted that Jackman\u2019s revelations could have to do with his \u201cunresolved childhood trauma.\u201d In December 2022, the Tony winner confessed to being in therapy to help him cope with his mother, Grace McNeil, leaving him when he was just 8 years old, Jackman was born in Sydney to English parents who had immigrated to Australia in 1967. When Jackman was 8, his parents divorced and his mother returned to England with his two sisters, while he stayed in Australia with his father and two brothers. \u201cI just started (therapy) recently,\u201d Jackman told Who magazine. \u201cIt helped me a lot. We all need a village.\u201d Jackman previously said that it had taken him years to come to terms with the idea that McNeil wouldn\u2019t be coming back for him. \u201cIt was traumatic,\u201d he told Who magazine in 2018, Today said. \u201cI thought she was probably going to come back. And then it sort of dragged on and on.\u201d Despite any feelings of abandonment experienced, Jackman also has said that his relationship with her is \u201cvery good.\u201d That\u2019s what he told \u201c60 Minutes Australia\u201d in 2012, when he said, \u201cI\u2019m not someone who\u2019s wallowed a lot in my family past. I don\u2019t feel like a victim \u2026 I feel very blessed actually in many ways.\u201d",

    "content": "SAN FRANCISCO (KGO) -- While Fleet Week has been going on for several days in San Francisco, some of the most anticipated events kick off on Friday. If you were in the city Thursday, you probably heard the loud sounds of the United States Navy Blue Angels. The group, made up of Navy and Marine Corps pilots, were practicing before three upcoming shows on Friday, Saturday and Sunday. But before they hit the skies, a Parade of Ships will take over the Bay. San Francisco Fleet Week 2023 schedule of events A fleet of ships will come under the Golden Gate Bridge and into the Bay starting at 11 a.m. on Friday. SF Fleet Week hosts the largest Parade of Ships on the West Coast, according to its website. San Francisco Fire Department boats will lead an escort of the Fleet while shooting jets of water into the air. You'll be able to see the Parade of Ships from anywhere from the Golden Gate Bridge to the Bay Bridge and along the San Francisco waterfront. A reviewing stand will be at the Marina Green. The parade is set to last an hour until 12 p.m. VIDEO: Meet 2 of the Blue Angel pilots flying over San Francisco during Fleet Week Fat Albert of the Blue Angels flies at 3 p.m. each day and when you see him, just know Blue Angels Super Hornet planes 1 through 6 are close behind. \"They go up and you can't hear them and you can't hear them until they get right above you, and then just as fast as they come they're gone,\" said Andrew Beard who works on a fishing boat named Lovely Martha. In terms of where to watch come actual show time, land is the cheapest option and Alcatraz tour tickets could put you on the island for $53. VIDEO: Here's what the 'super cool' Navy ship tours at San Francisco Fleet Week have to offer On Thursday for the Blue Angels' practice, some watched the Angels practice session from Alcatraz, others took to the docks of Fisherman's Wharf, and many watched in the shadows of the Golden Gate Bridge at the Marina Green. Many have opted to cruise with Captain Mike Rescino on his boat, the Lovely Martha for around $80 a person. \"There's still a couple boats with availability, but we've actually been sold out for this trip since March,\" said Rescino. If you do plan on coming to San Francisco for Fleet Week, you'll want to get to the city early because parking can be a challenge, especially in the Marina Green where there is only neighborhood parking.

    "content": "By Maria Loreto - New York October 06, 2023 12:35 PM EDT Gerard Pique can\u2019t escape Shakira . The Spanish soccer player appeared in an interview with El Escorpion Dorado , with the two driving around in a car and discussing Pique\u2019s career and accomplishments. As they drove, they decided to play some music, which invariably resulted in some Shakira hints. RELATED: Shakira is helped by handsome surf instructor after falling off surfboard: See pics Shakira and Piqu\u00e9 will reportedly sell their Barcelona properties View this post on Instagram A post shared by Escorpio\u0301n Dorado (@goldenescorpion) El Escorpion Dorado began the exchange by asking Pique about a song or an artist to play in the car. Pique requested Peso Pluma , saying that he\u2019s become incredibly popular. \u201cPlay the one of Peso Pluma and Bizarrap ,\u201d requested Pique. \u201cDo you want another Bizarrap song or should we just leave it at that?\u201d asked el Escorpion Dorado, laughing. \u201cLet\u2019s just leave it at that,\u201d said Pique. The interview went viral, with many viewers criticizing the host since he didn\u2019t pressure Pique for more. El Escorpion spoke about viewer reception on an interview, explaining that he and Pique were having good rapport, and he didn\u2019t want to get involved in a topic that\u2019s been so heavily discussed. \u201cWell, you don\u2019t ask about what\u2019s obvious. It\u2019s a topic that has been discussed a lot. The only person that has talked about it is Shakira. Pique hasn\u2019t said much. On my behalf, when there\u2019s kids involved I try to steer clear. Still, there were a couple of winks to Shakira over the course of the interview,\u201d he said. \u00a9Escorpion Dorado A look at the comments section of Escorpion Dorado\u2019s post Shakira at the Billboard Latin Music Awards For her part, Shakira is busier than ever. This past week, she\u2019s been readying the Billboard Latin Music Awards, which took place yesterday evening. In a panel conducted earlier this week, Shakira discussed her productivity and shared that making music has long been a form of therapy for her, and something that she turns to when she needs it most. \u201cIn composition, writing has always played a therapeutic role. I write the most when I\u2019m at my worst. Life gives me a blow, and from this, I have learned a lot and I feel stronger,\u201d she said in the panel, per Harper\u2019s Bazaar . \u201cMy music has been my main survival tool.\u201d Related Video: Taylor Swift's new romance with athlete Travis Kelce Loading the player...

    "description": "Amazon's Prime Day is bringing massive deals to wearables. If you're looking to buy a smartwatch or fitness tracker, look here for the best offers.",
    "content": "Smartwatches and fitness trackers are ubiquitous in 2023, and they can provide utility or even save your life. But they are expensive, with the best smartwatches costing hundreds of dollars or more. That's in addition to what you've already paid for a smartphone, so wearables can be a hard sell if you're not sure how useful they will be. For that reason, the best time to buy a smartwatch or fitness tracker is when there are great deals you can take advantage of. Amazon is holding a sales event called Prime Big Deal Days, and it's a preview of what's to come during and . While we don't know a lot about it just yet, we do know it'll be a great time to buy a new wearable. Early Prime Big Deal Days wearable deals Google just announced the new Pixel Watch 2, but the last-gen model is seeing massive discounts. You can get it for just $280 now at either Amazon or Best Buy. There's even a chance that it experiences an even bigger discount when Prime Big Deal Days officially start. Samsung's Galaxy Watch 5 Pro isn't the newest smartwatch the company has to offer, but it's still great in 2023. You can get it at a sweet $50 discount ahead of the Prime Big Deal Days sales event. Apple just debuted the Apple Watch Series 9 last month, but you can already get it at a discount. This is the lowest price we've seen on Amazon for the Series 9 yet. If you're looking to upgrade to a new Apple Watch, now is the time. What we're expecting from Prime Big Deal Days All the major smartwatch brands have released new models since the last Prime Day. There's the , , and the , among others. That means that we should see some significant discounts to last-generation models of those product lines. If you don't need the newest features, grabbing an older model could save you hundreds on Prime Big Deal Days. Since many of the new releases are only minor refinements of their prior generations, Prime Big Deal Days is a great time to upgrade to a last-gen wearable at a sweet discount. What we know about Amazon's upcoming sales event Amazon announced last month that it will be holding a new sales event named Prime Big Deal Days, which will span from October 10 through October 11. This isn't the first time that Amazon has offered a sales event in October. Last year, it gave Amazon Prime members \"early access\" to discounts coming for Black Friday and Cyber Monday with the Prime Early Access Sale. While the Prime Early Access Sale isn't returning this year, we expect the Prime Big Deal Days sale to follow a similar format to last year's event. That means thousands of products in many categories should experience significant discounts during Prime Big Deal Days. When and where will Prime Big Deal Days be held? Prime Big Deal Days will take between October 10 and October 11, but you can get early access to deals starting now. Amazon said that buyers in 19 different countries can participate in the sale: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, the U.S., and the UK. Do you need to be a Prime member to save on Prime Big Deal Days? Prime Big Deal Days will be exclusive to Prime members, like Amazon's other sales events, including Amazon Prime Day. You can participate without paying for a membership by starting a 30-day free trial before Prime Big Deal Days begin. This offer is only available to new subscribers, so if you've already subscribed to Amazon Prime before, you'll need to pay an annual fee of $139 or a monthly fee of $15. If you start your free trial now, you'll get access to Prime Big Deal Days for free. Prime Big Deal Days vs. Prime Day: What\u2019s the difference? Prime Big Deal Days is a preview of sales to come during Black Friday and Cyber Monday, so it's a secondary sales event for Amazon. The company typically offers more discounts and deals during its main Amazon Prime Day sale in July, which lasts 48 hours. However, even though there won't be as many deals this time around, the discounts are just as massive. You won't want to miss it, because wearables often see their lowest prices ever during Amazon sales events. Will there be a second Prime Day in 2023? Although the retailer has confirmed that Prime Big Deal Days will take place in October, it isn't officially a second Prime Day. Instead, Amazon's fall sales events are typically previews of what's to come during Black Friday and Cyber Monday festivities. The company's Prime Day was held from July 12 to July 13, 2023. However, if you're looking for a second Prime Day, your best bet will be to take advantage of Prime Big Deal Days. FAQ This largely depends on what you plan to use your smartwatch or fitness tracker for. If you're just trying to track your steps and receive notifications on your wrist, you probably don't need to spend more than a few hundred dollars for that functionality. However, if you need a wearable to step up your training or get in shape, you might want to spend more for these advanced features. Unless you are an athlete who knows exactly how a wearable will improve your workouts, you shouldn't spend more than $400-$600 on your new device. If you're an iPhone user, the best experience will be had when purchasing an Apple Watch. Garmin wearables will work with iOS, but the integration isn't as good as using an Apple Watch. However, Android users have a lot more options. The Google Pixel Watch will work great with any Android phone, and the Samsung Galaxy Watch has integration with Samsung smartphones.",

    "description": "Eggs and potatoes form a classic combo in many breakfast dishes. You've probably never tried cooking your eggs in a baked potato, but you totally should.",
    "content": "There aren't many foods out there quite as versatile as . From cheese and sour cream to chili and salsa, they're a prime vessel for toppings of all types; their starchy, mild flavor allows them to serve as a neutral base for countless concoctions. Eggs are a similar sort of food \u2014 a platform for ingredients of many kinds. Various omelet styles abound, as well as everything you could possibly put into a scramble, fold into a quiche, or add to a frittata. If you've never combined the power of baked potatoes and eggs, you're missing out on something delicious. Eggs and potatoes go together beautifully \u2014 there's a reason why there are so many varieties of breakfast potatoes. And, the shape of a scooped-out baked potato half is the perfect cradle for cooking a nice, oven-baked runny egg. The drippy, fatty egg yolk serves as a decadent topping for a fluffy baked potato interior. Eggs naturally go well with many of the traditional baked potato toppings, such as cheese and bacon. It's a pairing that just makes sense. Eggs are particularly good when paired with twice-baked potatoes as opposed to their singular-baked counterparts. are the upscaled, slightly more decadent version of a baked potato and they involve an extra step or two to really pack in the flavor. Rather than simply baking the potato in the oven, fluffing up the insides, topping it with your preferred ingredients, and calling it a day, twice-baked potatoes require you to scoop out the interior of the potato fully. That fluff then gets mixed with a variety of ingredients \u2014 typically ingredients you might find in a mashed potato recipe \u2014 until it's a paste. It's then filled back into the potato skin and baked a second time until the cheese gets melty and everything melds in the heat of the oven. When the potato goes back into the oven, you can press a little divot into the paste and crack an egg into it. The egg will set during the short extra time in the oven. This dish is sometimes called an \"Idaho Sunrise,\" and if you'd prefer to get a little different, frying or poaching an egg separately and topping the potato with it after the fact always works. If you're on a creative kick with your morning eggs, baked potatoes are only the beginning of the list of unique ways you can cook an egg in an edible vessel. , or egg cooked in bread with a circular cutout, is a classic. Avocado egg boats are a popular and fun way to eat eggs without the carbs of potatoes or bread. Pitted avocados come with a natural, egg-shaped hole in the center that can cradle a cracked egg for a short stint in the oven. You can enjoy this as a creamy and rich breakfast treat with a little sprinkling of seasoning and herbs on top. Prefer something a little lower in calorie count? Bell pepper halves also work perfectly as egg cups, and they're as colorful as they are delicious. Add a touch of cheese if you're looking for a pop of additional flavor.",

Speaking to Variety , Gilligan said this idea is \"doubtful as hell.\" Gilligan said he enjoyed working with RJ Mitte, who played Walt Jr., but making him follow in the footsteps of his father would be \"depressing as hell.\" \"That would be the wrong lesson from the show, if there are any lessons at all to be gleaned from it,\" Gilligan said. Also in the interview, Gilligan said he finds himself from time to time thinking about Breaking Bad's characters and what they're doing in the world now that the show has ended. He said Walt. Jr. and Skyler (Anna Gunn) are great people playing great roles and he wants to believe they found some happy ending after the events of Breaking Bad. \"When Breaking Bad ends, it's not a very happy ending for those characters at all, but it is presented that their lives go on. I'd like to believe things get better for them,\" he said. \"I'd hate the thought of Walt Jr. following in Walt's footsteps in the crime business.\" Gilligan said he expects someone to pitch a show about Walt Jr. in the next 10-15 years, with the story of Walt Jr. becoming the next Albuquerque crime boss and \"succeeding where his father failed.\" But Gilligan wants nothing to do with this. \"I could pretty much guarantee right now that I have no interest in seeing that happen. That'd be a sad tribute to the show,\" he said. \"It's fun thinking about what would happen to the characters, but it doesn't rise to the level of, 'Gee, I'd like to tell more about the story.' But who knows, in a few years maybe.\" Gilligan is finished with the Breaking Bad universe for now, following his work on that show, Better Call Saul, and the Netflix movie El Camino. Now, he's making a sci-fi series for Apple TV+ starring Rhea Seehorn.",

    "content": "Flexible working used to be taboo in many American workplaces \u2013 a modular, bespoke arrangement that was viewed by many as simply working less, rather than working better or more flexibly. More often than not, it was considered a perk or purely the realm of women and mothers. Nobody ever got to CEO by asking HR for more flexibility, right? And yet, one pandemic later, flexibility is not such an F-word after all. According to the most recent , not only do U.S. workers want the option of flexible working, they\u2019re not afraid to ask for more of it. And in the post-Covid landscape, when people have the chance to work flexibly, 87% of them take it. Prior McKinsey research had already shown that for those that left their jobs at the start of the pandemic, However, not everyone on the workforce spectrum is as enthusiastic about flexible working. Employers are apparently getting less and less tolerant of elastic working practices, the further we get from the Covid era. A survey of more than 1,806 US workers conducted by Monster in January 2023 showed that while half of employers believe giving their people flexible schedules has worked well, a third of firms who had planned to adopt a virtual or hybrid model had from a year ago. Experts believe this is a mistake. The work-life balance benefits that come with flexible working are undisputed, while it has been proven again and again that . Still, employee resistance abounds and key talent who find that their flexibility needs are no longer being met are either moving on, or practicing the not-so-subtle art of coffee badging: showing up at the office just long enough to grab a coffee and have a minimum of interactions before heading home again. If you intend to negotiate flexible working in a current or new contract, there are a few key things worth doing. First, schedule face-to-face time with management to discuss it. Come armed with a proposal that outlines exactly how you plan to communicate with the office, how you will still reach all of your required targets, and be honest about your needs and the reason behind them. \u2019 \u2013 being clear about defining your tasks and how you\u2019ll be assessed under a flexible model. Finally, if you score your ideal flexibility scenario, share as much information as you can with co-workers about what your new working week looks like and keep communication lines open. But don\u2019t let any old-fashioned stigmas get you down \u2013 just because you have flexible hours does not mean you\u2019re any less dedicated than your colleagues.

    "content": "By Shirley G\u00f3mez - New York October 06, 2023 12:02 PM EDT Jamie Spears , the estranged father of pop icon Britney Spears , is battling a severe health issue in the hospital. According to exclusive information obtained by Page Six , Jamie has been struggling with a severe infection that has necessitated surgical intervention, leading to his hospitalization in a specialized infectious disease facility. With his health condition described as \u201cseverely ill\u201d by sources close to the family, concerns for Jamie\u2019s well-being are rising. In recent months, there has been growing concern over Jamie Spears\u2018 health. TMZ first reported in August that he had been hospitalized \u201cseveral months ago\u201d due to complications from a knee replacement surgery he had undergone in the mid-2000s. \u00a9GettyImages While the details surrounding the nature of these complications remain undisclosed, the recent revelation of a severe infection requiring surgery suggests that Jamie\u2019s health issues have taken a more serious turn. Celebrity health Sharon and Kelly Osbourne open up about weight loss and Ozempic Alex Rodriguez thanks girlfriend Jaclyn Cordeiro for \u2018life-changing\u2019 30+ pound weight loss Sophia Loren sustained significant injuries after falling in her home Amidst Jamie Spears\u2018 ongoing health battle, there have been rumors circulating, particularly a report by the Daily Mail claiming that he had entered rehab for his struggles with alcohol over the summer. However, an insider source has refuted this claim, stating that the rehab reports are false. Jamie\u2019s lawyer has not commented on his health condition or addressed the rumors surrounding his rehabilitation. In 2021, Jamie Spears was suspended as the conservator of Britney\u2019s estate , immediately removing him from the conservatorship altogether. At the request of Britney and her legal team, Judge Brenda Penny agreed it was time to remove the controversial patriarch in front of a packed hearing in Los Angeles Superior Court.

The This has up to 24-hour wear and even extends your lashes to +36% length and 10X the volume! There\u2019s a hybrid fiber technology involved, which mixes different fibers and sizes up to 3mm to bring your lashes to their best potential, along with an extended helix brush to ensure the mascara reaches root to tip. Whenever you apply, you\u2019ll be asked if you\u2019re wearing falsies, since the mascara extends and voluminizes your lashes so well. It\u2019s clump-resistant and you won\u2019t have to worry about smudges, flakes, and smears \u2014 it\u2019s that good! Derrek also shared some tips while using as well. \u201cWipe excess mascara off the wand with a tissue, and then sweep the wand through the bottom lashes first; if you do them last, you\u2019ll smudge. Let it dry, and then apply a second coat,\u201d he said. Many reviewers are raving about the mascara as well. \u201cI am thrilled to have found this mascara. It does everything it is supposed to do\u2013great length and color, no clumping\u2013 for a fraction of the price of other mascaras. I did not experience any smudging or flaking after a hot day.

Manchester United 0-1 Arsenal (Blackstenius, 14) All her own work once Russo and Catley had sent the Swedish striker away. She cuts in, checks and scores. Jonas really enjoyed that one on the sidelines. 4m ago 14.43 EDT 12 min: An unfortunate slip means Arsenal concede a corner, Geyse pushing up, and D\u2019Angelo unable to keep it in. United win another as Toone pings in her effort. 5m ago 14.42 EDT 11 min: This is a tight affair. United\u2019s defence is organised, Arsenal pushing hard but not yet finding the final pass. 8m ago 14.40 EDT 8 min: United are looking to the long ball to pick off the Arsenal press, with the likes of Katie Zelem good passers of the ball. Up the other end, there\u2019s an echoey boo as Russo gets on the ball. She\u2019s been quiet so far. 11m ago 14.37 EDT 6 min: Two Spaniards in United\u2019s Garcia and Arsenal\u2019s get in a tangle but it\u2019s all smiles once the ball goes dead. 12m ago 14.36 EDT 5 min: Early Arsenal chance, Maritz pumping the ball into the middle but their forwards miss their cue. The first United chance follows quickly, Toone sending Garcia away, only for the cross to nestle in D\u2019Angelo\u2019s hands. 14m ago 14.34 EDT 3 min: Quite a long time taken over an Arsenal throw, which may be a result of the unfamiliarity of their team. Same back three as last week, so some continuity. 16m ago 14.32 EDT 1 min: And away we go. United begin calmly amid the raucous scenes, Arsenal looking to press high. 18m ago 14.29 EDT Pretty rowdy at Leigh Sports Village, the home fans fancy another win over Arsenal. 21m ago 14.26 EDT Charles Antaki gets in contact on Arsenal . He\u2019s worried: \u201cI think Arsenal fans know that lose this one, and the terrible start to the season (out of the Champions League before it properly starts; loss at home in the WSL in the first game) continues, and the clouds not only gather, but clump together, take a deep breath, and rain all over pretty well the entire season\u2019s parade. No wonder Eidevall has made six changes. But the worry is that apart from Kim Little, there\u2019s no top-level, consistent quality in the side, and the Miedema/Williamson/Mead cavalry is still somewhere over a far distant hill\u2026\u201d 25m ago 14.22 EDT The big news is that Jonas Eidevall has made six changes from last week, that\u2019s a lot and in the prelims he\u2019s said that \u201cno place is guaranteed\u201d. The big absence is Katie McCabe. Marc Skinner, meanwhile, has made no changes from last week while Sabrina D\u2019Angelo, Noelle Maritz, Victoria Pelova, Laia Codina, Amanda Ilestedt and Stina Blackstenius are IN. And Maneula Zinsberger, Lotte Wubben-Moy, Close Lacasse, Katie McCabe, Frida Maanum and Caitlin Foord are OUT. That includes a change of goalie \u2013 D\u2019Angelo for Zinsberger. These teams met twice last season, and Manchester United won both matches, Russo scoring the winner in their home match. 1h ago 13.33 EDT Here's the teams Russo starts against her old team\u2026. \ud83d\udea8 Presenting our first home #WSL line-up of 2023/24! \ud83d\udd34 Let's go, Reds! \ud83d\udcaa #MUWomen \u2014 Manchester United Women (@ManUtdWomen) October 6, 2023 Manchester United: Earps, Blundell, Le Tissier, Turner, George, Ladd, Zelem, Garcia, Toone, Galton, Geyse.

While the visitors will turn out in a new, Stella McCartney-designed bespoke away shirt for Friday\u2019s match, United have their own visual cue to represent their off-field progress. A mural of Mary Earps, created by the club with Sky Sports and daubed with the words \u201cWelcome to Manchester\u201d, sends a defiant message after the England keeper stayed at United this summer, amid persistent interest from Arsenal. Jonas Eidevall earns Arsenal contract but needs WSL wins quickly Read more 1h ago 13.30 EDT Preamble It\u2019s a big night for Alessia Russo, the Lioness who left Manchester United to join Arsenal. The pressure\u2019s immediately on for Arsenal, after losing last week to Liverpool, a blow to follow their premature Champions League exit. This was supposed to be the season that they put down a big title challenge and, judging from recent WSL seasons, the margin for error is not large so an away win is high on Jonas Eidevall\u2019s wishlist. For Manchester United\u2019s Marc Skinner, an away win at Aston Villa was a handy start over a decent side, with Rachel Williams scoring in injury time to win it. Lucia Garcia\u2019s goal was a good sign for a team hoping to replace Russo from within. Kick-off at 7.30pm, join me.

    "content": "ANTIOCH \u2014 A motorcyclist stopped for a red light was fatally injured Thursday when police said he was hit from behind by a speeding vehicle. He was identified by the coroner\u2019s office on Friday as William Marlik Jr., 63, of Bay Point. The fatal collision happened about 2:08 p.m. Thursday at the intersection of Deer Valley Road and Prewett Ranch Drive. Authorities said Marlik was stopped at a red signal light when he was struck by a speeding vehicle, causing him to be ejected. Police did not say which street Marlik actually was on or what kind of vehicle hit him. He was taken to a hospital, where he later died. The force of the crash caused both the motorcycle and the other vehicle to collide with two other vehicles at the intersection, police said. Authorities said police officers were nearby on an unrelated matter and immediately rushed to the scene and began rendering first aid to all involved. Police did not say exactly how many people that was or what the extent of their injuries were. The driver of the vehicle that caused the collision remained on scene and was cooperating with traffic investigators. Police said speed and inattention appear to be the cause of the collision, but they did not announce an arrest in the incident. Anyone with information about the collision is asked to call the police non-emergency number at or email traffic investigator Frederick Blumberg at .

If there\u2019s \u201ca vaxx\u201d war between the two NFL stars, Rodgers started it during his regular Tuesday appearance on the \u201cThe Pat McAfee Show.\u201d Rodgers made his \u201cMr. Pfizer\u201d wisecrack two days after his New York Jets lost to Kelce\u2019s Chiefs 23-20 on Sunday. Rodgers, a four-time MVP, didn\u2019t play because he suffered an achilles tendon injury in the first game of the season. When McAfee asked Rodgers to assess the Jets\u2019 play, the Chico-reared quarterback commended the Jets\u2019 defense, suggesting that his teammates managed to keep Kelce from scoring any touchdowns. \u201cMr. Pfizer, we kinda shut him down,\u201d Rodgers said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t have a crazy impact game. Obviously he had some yards and stuff. It felt like for the most part we played.\u201d The \u201cMr. Pfizer\u201d comment prompted McAfee and his co-host A.J. Hawk to laugh uneasily. Rodgers and McAfee then spent the next few minutes riffing on a joke Rodgers once made, which prompted a false report that he suffered \u201cCOVID toe\u201d during his 2021 bout with the virus. McAfee asked Rodgers if it felt good for him to throw some shade at Kelce for his Pfizer endorsement. He also asked Rodgers whether his \u201cMr. Pfizer\u201d quip was planned. Rodgers deflected by saying he\u2019s known Kelce a long time and can\u2019t see how he would be bothered by his joke. \u201cNo, he\u2019s doing commercials for Pfizer, so I\u2019m sure he\u2019s owning it,\u201d Rodgers said. But Hawk pointed out that Kelce also endorses a number of other products and wondered why Rodgers didn\u2019t call him, for example, \u201cMr. Lowe\u2019s.\u201d On Friday, Kelce shrugged off Rodgers\u2019 \u201cMr Pfizer\u201d remark, while explaining his position on the COVID shot. \u201cI mean, I\u2019ve always been, you know \u2014 once I got the vaccine, I mean \u2014 I got it before of keeping myself safe, keeping my family safe, the people in this building,\u201d Kelce said. \u201cSo, yeah, I stand by it. 1,000 percent. And fully comfortable with him calling me Mr. Pfizer.\u201d Even as Rodgers and Kelce tried to laugh off the \u201cMr. Pfizer\u201d comment, it still takes on darker connotations when viewed in the context of attacks that Kelce and his rumored girlfriend Taylor Swift have endured in the past few months. The attacks, from vaccine skeptics, include recycled conspiracy theories about COVID-19 shots, AFP reported, via Yahoo News. Some of the internet\u2019s \u201cmost notorious anti-vaxxers,\u201d such as Charlie Kirk, founder of conservative organization Turning Point USA, also have been exploiting the \u201cbuzz\u201d around Kelce and Swift\u2019s rumored romance in order to crack jokes, lob insults and push false claims that vaccines cause widespread heart problems or kill people. It would seem that Rodgers would be particularly attuned to the heated rhetoric used by \u201cnotorious anti-vaxxers,\u201d since he\u2019s a well-known vaccine skeptic himself. Back in November 2021, the former Green Bay Packers star infamously tested positive for the coronavirus and revealed on \u201cThe Pat McAfee Show\u201d that he had not gotten the vaccine. During that incendiary appearance, Rodgers was accused of spreading common anti-vaccine disinformation when he launched into an angry screed to justify why he had not gotten the vaccine.",

    "content": "California startup Pacific Adventure Works is about to make it much easier to sleep in your vehicle, without the expense and bulk of an all-out RV build. The company puts a unique spin on the \"bedroll\" with a portable sleeper platform that rolls up slim for travel and quickly builds into a fully adjustable bed that turns your beat-up Toyota 4Runner or Subaru Outback into the ultimate oceanfront or mountaintop abode. It's designed to work with all kinds of different hatchback vehicles and set up in minutes, giving adventurers the full freedom and flexibility the wide-open road and wilderness demand. While a ground tent gets you closer to nature than any camper van or motorhome, all it takes is one night of foul, windy weather to get you questioning why you're spending the night in a light aluminum-boned hunk of sail fabric and not in the fully enclosed multi-ton car or SUV parked just steps away. While many SUVs and station wagon offer the space to do exactly that, a trunk filled with camping gear, sports equipment and luggage you can't simply toss out into exposed weather can make the idea a nonstarter. And rear seats don't always fold perfectly flat, leaving something to be desired in terms of lying comfort. We've seen no shortage of meant to create a more comfortable, level vehicle camping experience inside factory cars and SUVs, but these tend to be heavy and inflexible, requiring precise mounting locations in the vehicle and quite possibly eating up valuable space you'd rather use to transport something else. Each one also tends to be designed for a specific model or subset of vehicles and won't work with just any ol' wagon. Pacific Adventure Works has made it a mission to offer a lighter, simpler, more flexible solution for turning a basic station wagon, SUV or crossover into a cozy overnight shelter. Borrowing a little inspiration from the folding roll-top camping table, it's designed a two-part raised sleeper platform to work with a large vehicle set. Called the Hideaway Sleeping Platform (HSP), Pacific's design rides as a roundish 40- or 48-in-long (102- or 122-cm) package, depending on bed size, with a diameter of just 8 inches (20 cm). All the individual frame members and connectors store inside the ribbed nylon topper, rolling into a package that you can slide into the cargo area. When it's time to camp, the HSP's aluminum beams build up into a full frame with help from polypropylene hubs, no tools required, supporting the fabric-covered platform that rolls out on top. From there, you can drop on a foam or inflatable mattress and enjoy a homestyle bed inside four solid automotive walls. The Hideaway platform supports up to 400 lb (181 kg). At 30 to 35 lb (13.6 to 15.9 kg) for the full kit, the HSP is plenty manageable for one person. Its legs adjust in height to even out uneven vehicle floors and offer between 9.5 and 15.5 inches (24 to 39 cm) of under-bed storage space \u2013 so you don't have to dump all your cargo outside. It won't clear a larger cooler or fridge/freezer, but it can top storage boxes, boxes, an vacuum-insulated hard cooler, soft coolers, loose stoves and gear, etc. Users can adjust the height for the best combination of headroom and under-bed storage space. Just as importantly, the Hideaway's telescoping frame slide-adjusts in total length, up to 72 in (183 cm), to fit the vehicle snugly. It even shortens to roughly half-length to create a platform that fits over the load area behind the rear seats, where it can work as a shelf for storing a second level of gear or just a privacy cover to hide any valuables in the trunk. Pacific Adventure Works plans to launch preorders this month, with deliveries to begin in December. It will offer the kit as a 30-in-wide (76-cm) Solo platform for $599, a 40-in-wide (102-cm) Double for $699 and a 48-in-wide (122-cm) XL for $799. It plans to build the kits in the US and prides itself on \"buy-it-for-life\" construction. The modular nature of the design also means that it will be easy enough to replace any parts that do break along the journey. Source:",

    "description": "The custody battle between the Tesla CEO and the singer is heating up, with a report on how he filed suit first to establish control over their three young children.",
    "content": "The custody battle between Elon Musk and Grimes is heating up with a report that the Tesla CEO actually filed suit first to establish parental rights over their three young children, claiming that he has had \u201cactual care, control, and possession of each child\u201d since their birth. Last month, Musk secretly filed a petition in Texas to establish parental rights over the children, ages 3 and 1, before Grimes, whose birth name is Claire Boucher, decided to sue the tech mogul herself in San Francisco this week, according to and . In his petition, filed Sept. 7, Musk accused Grimes, his sometimes girlfriend, of moving California to escape the jurisdiction of Texas courts, Insider reported. He said Grimes lived with him and their three children in Texas from May to July this year, Insider said. But after Musk served Grimes on Sept. 13, she turned around and sued him in San Francisco Superior Court on Sept. 29. In , Grimes has asked for physical custody of the children and includes a \u201cstandard restraining order,\u201d which would prevent the children from being moved out of California by either parent. These dueling lawsuits mark the latest conflict over the children between Musk and Grimes, a couple who were in an on-again, off-again relationship starting in 2018, Insider said. Musk and Grimes first became parents together in May 2020 when she gave birth to their son, X \u00c6 A-Xii, otherwise known as X. In late 2021, Grimes revealed that they also became parents of a daughter, Exa Dark Sider\u00e6l, who was born via surrogate. More recently, the couple confirmed they also had a son together, Techno Mechanicus, nicknamed Tau, who also was born via surrogate. Although the couple reportedly first broke up in 2022, they appeared to maintain a cordial relationship, Insider said. Grimes even continued to live with Musk in Austin for a period after they broke up. Still, Grimes revealed that she had problems with some of Musk\u2019s parenting choices. She told Vanity Fair that she preferred to keep their children out of the public eye and expressed dismay when Musk began to bring their oldest child, X, to public events. \u201cI mean, I think E is really seeing him as a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and bringing him to everything and stuff,\u201d Grimes told Vanity Fair. The first sign that their relationship had turned hostile came last month when Grimes shared a since-deleted post on X, her ex-boyfriend\u2019s platform, in which she alleged that he wasn\u2019t allowing her to see one of their children, possibly X. She also threatened to take the billionaire to court unless he let her see her son or responded to her lawyer. She said the situation was \u201cutterly ripping my family apart.\u201d In Grimes\u2019 , the singer is also seeking to \u201cestablish parental relationship.\u201d Los Angeles-based family law attorney Christopher Melcher said this request is routine in cases when couples are not not married and is usually filed alongside demands for child support and custody rights. TMZ said it appears that Grimes is setting up a situation to have a judge establish custody rights and child support. Unless there is a finding that Grimes is an unfit parent, she would almost certainly have some custodial rights, TMZ said. In fact, judges usually award both parents joint custody. In Musk\u2019s court filings, he said believed the custody dispute would settle, but wanted Texas courts to weigh in if it didn\u2019t, Insider said. If Grimes has been complaining about Musk being inflexible when it comes to parenting, many would say she could have informed herself better before she chose to have three children with him. For starts, the tech mogul has 11 children with three different women and has expressed the belief that declining birth rates are a threat to human civilization and that \u201csmart people\u201d like himself need to populate the earth with as many children as possible. Musk\u2019s first wife, Canadian novelist Justine Wilson, characterized him as a difficult, controlling and patriarchal. Musk and Wilson, who were married from 2000 to 2008, had six children together, the first of whom died at age 10 weeks of sudden infant death syndrome. Wilson said Musk grew up in the male-dominated culture of South Africa and has a \u201cwill to compete and dominate.\u201d More recently, Musk welcomed twins with his current partner Shivon Zitis. The twins were born shortly before Grimes and Musk welcomed their daughter Exa Dark Sider\u00e6l. According to the new biography of Musk by Water Isaacson, Grimes apparently only learned that Musk and Zilis had twins together at the same time as the rest of the public \u2014 even though Zilis gave birth while Grimes and Musk\u2019s surrogate was just down the hallway in the same maternity ward, Jezebel reported.",

    "content": "LAJAS BLANCAS, Panama (AP) \u2014 At the edge of Panama\u2019s Darien jungle Friday, Venezuelans made up the majority of migrants waiting for buses to speed them across the country to Costa Rica, where they planned to continue moving north. Annie Carrillo, a 38-year-old Venezuelan migrant traveling with her Colombian husband and another friend, said they had crossed the dense, lawless jungle from Colombia in three days after paying $350 each to a guide. When she heard about the U.S. government\u2019s plan to restart deportation flights to Venezuela in the coming days, Carrillo was discouraged. \u201cNo one emigrates from their country because they want to. One migrates because you have basic needs and there isn\u2019t support in your native country,\u201d she said, starting to cry. The U.S. government hopes the threat of deportation will be enough to make Venezuelans reconsider trying to enter the United States illegally and opt instead for the online appointment system to make asylum claims or other legal paths. But some migrants said Friday that it would not stop them from continuing their journey. Venezuela has suffered political, economic and humanitarian crises over the past decade, pushing at least 7.3 million people to migrate and making food and other necessities unaffordable for those who remain. The vast majority who fled settled in neighboring countries in Latin America, but many began coming to the United States in the last three years. Observers have pointed out that earlier this week the Biden administration justified the expansion of temporary protected status for Venezuelans announced last month by noting the severe humanitarian challenges in the country. But now the administration has decided Venezuela is not bad enough to keep them from deporting migrants back there. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security\u2019s assistant secretary for border and immigration policy said Friday that it is already repatriating people to countries with humanitarian situations similar to those in Venezuela. \u201cThese direct repatriations are obviously made now to Venezuela, but also to other countries that have complicated situations such as Haiti, Cuba and other countries around the world,\u201d Blas N\u00fa\u00f1ez-Neto told reporters. \u201cWhat we are announcing is in accordance with our laws, with our international obligations.\u201d The U.S. Border Patrol encountered Venezuelans 22,000 times along the southwest border in August, nearly double the number in July, but still slightly below the 25,000 encounters in August 2022. Although Venezuelans make up about 60% of the migrants crossing the Darien Gap this year, they trail migrant numbers from countries including Mexico, Honduras and Guatemala at the U.S. border. At least 18 migrants died and more were injured Friday when a bus carrying them crashed in the southern Mexican state of Oaxaca. N\u00fa\u00f1ez-Neto said that more than 130,000 Venezuelans had arrived to the U.S. in the past year through legal paths, such as CBP One and humanitarian parole. Still more than 2,500 miles (4,000 kilometers) from the nearest U.S. border crossing, Carrillo hadn\u2019t made up her mind yet about whether they would wait for an appointment to seek asylum or risk crossing and turning themselves over to U.S. border agents. She said they had heard it could take more than three months to get an appointment through CBP One, an eternity for migrants who usually spend all their money just making it to the border. \u201cWhat sense is there in making this journey where every second counts and every second you\u2019re putting your life at risk and only to arrive in a country and have them deport you just like that?\u201d Carrillo said. Patricia Andrade, one of the founders of the humanitarian assistance organization Venezuelan Roots in Miami, was incredulous about the possibility of mass deportations to Venezuela considering that thousands of migrants arrive every day at the southern border. \u201cHow many flights are they going to take?\u201d Andrade said. She said Venezuelans are fleeing their country out of desperation and will continue to come. \u201cThe announcement of deportations is not going to scare everyone,\u201d said Andrade, whose organization provides clothes, sheets, towels and pots to Venezuelan recent arrivals. \u201cAs long as the Venezuelan problem is not resolved, people will continue arriving.\u201d Back in Lajas Blancas, Panama, at the edge of the Darien jungle, Jhonny Zambrano, a 20-year-old Venezuelan, waited with his parents, sister and niece. He said the family did not have a plan yet for when they reach the U.S. border, but that if he was deported he would try again until he was successful. He had been a student in Venezuela, but the economic situation made it impossible for him to continue his studies, forcing him at times to go without eating at school. \u201cWhat am I going to do in our country?\u201d Zambrano asked. If deported, \u201cI would do it (migrate) again to work and to get my family ahead.\u201d ___ Salomon reported from Miami.",

    "content": "Augmented reality eyewear is great for providing turn-by-turn navigational cues, but a lot of the goggles and visors have a kind of \u2026 vibe. Blucap Moto sunglasses are different, in that they won't make you look like a Sheldon Cooper wannabe. As their name implies, the Blucap Motos are made for use by motorcycle riders. A version for cyclists is reportedly in the works. The very normal-looking sunglasses wirelessly communicate with a handlebar-mounted remote and an iOS/Android app on the user's smartphone \u2013 that phone can just be stuffed in a pocket or backpack. Once the user has selected their destination on the app, they just put on the glasses and hit the road. Whenever the user subsequently approaches an intersection where they have to turn, a tiny MicroLED display projects a directional arrow onto the inside of the right-hand lens. That arrow automatically disappears once the turn has been made. If the user wishes to see where they are within a street map, pushing a button on the remote temporarily brings up a monochrome map segment with their position indicated on it. It's also possible to have the app display incoming phone calls, text messages and speed limit alerts. The calls can be taken via a paired third-party Bluetooth headset. All of that having been said, the Motos are designed to be very simple and uncluttered. They feature no buttons or other physical controls, plus they power up and connect with the phone/remote as soon as their arms are opened. One charge of their integrated lithium battery is reportedly good for 10 hours of use, while the remote should run for about six months per pair of button cell batteries. The glasses feature a neutral set of permanent inner lenses, which can be combined with various interchangeable outer lens. They come with a set of polarized, scratch-resistant, anti-fog, tinted outer lenses which block 100% of UVA and UVB light. And yes, they can be ordered with prescription lenses. The Blucap Moto sunglasses are currently the subject of a , where a pledge of US$299 will get you a set \u2013 assuming they reach production. Their planned retail price is $399. They're demonstrated in the following video. Sources: ,",

    "content": "Cars are so technologically advanced and filled with so many features now, a time traveler from just 10-15 years ago would be wowed if they were to get into a current car on the market. The advent of EVs has seemed to accelerate things, with automakers using them as testbeds to showcase the latest and greatest technology. Things like over two feet of , enough systems for two vehicles, full entertainment systems and more seat adjustments than one person could ever need are commonplace now. But what if you\u2019re one of the people who don\u2019t have a need for or don\u2019t care for some of this stuff? While the tech is welcome, it\u2019s helping to drive up the cost of cars. And a lot of the tech that comes equipped in cars some may refuse to use. Hands free driving systems and smart cruise control for instance. I refuse to use them. Not for fear or anything\u2026well I guess you could say that. I don\u2019t trust them or think the technology is advanced enough to be using them yet. The fact that you have to keep your eyes forward and your hands near the wheel to take over tells us as much. And when you live in a place with as much traffic as Southern California, systems like that in stop and go traffic don\u2019t really make much sense to me. So now you know what car feature I refuse to use. Now it\u2019s your turn. What car features do you refuse to use? It can be anything, from as simple as heated seats to something like Ford\u2019s BlueCruise or GM\u2019s SuperCruise. Let us know in the comments.",

Johnson (who was previously in a long-term relationship with Foster), plus five other named women and one whose identity has been anonymized, have now filed a lawsuit against Foster, accusing him of a \u201cdisturbing pattern and practice of chilling and depraved behavior towards women,\u201d and suing him on charges of \u201cdomestic violence, sexual battery, assault, stalking, civil rights violations, gender violence, and the intentional infliction of emotional distress.\u201d In the suit, Johnson alleges that Foster, who she began dating in 2012, frequently abused drugs and alcohol, and, after their relationship ended earlier this year, attempted to extort her for $150,000. (He is also accused of using her home\u2019s security system to track her movements.) Her sister, Haylie Langseth, is also a plaintiff in the suit, saying Foster groped her in front of several people, and that she felt pressured not to report him because she feared he would retaliate against her sister. Foster worked for for several years, appearing on multiple specials from the -based web series; he also hosted several official talk shows centered on the franchise\u2019s content. He left in 2021, with the company, , expressing \u201cmad love and support\u201d for him; the lawsuit now alleges that he was actually fired, at least in part over his behavior on social media.

In addition to the accusations from Johnson and her sister, the lawsuit also includes accusations of verbal abuse and groping from several other women, including subordinates at , who state that Foster used his status as the company to gain access to women.

    "description": "Todd McFarlane reveals the new Batman & Robin figures for DC Multiverse",
    "content": "Todd McFarlane revealed some new additions to his hit DC Multiverse line of action figures at Toy Fair , including the entire line of figures from the infamous 1997 film Batman & Robin. McFarlane took a minute at Toy Fair to show off the new line, which includes Batman (George Clooney), Robin (Chris O'Donnell), Batgirl (Alicia Silverstone), and Poison Ivy (Uma Thurman) . There is one more character in the set, and that would be Mr. Freeze himself Arnold Schwarzenegger, who is the set's Build-A-Figure. Freeze's legs are with Batman, while the arms and some feeze effects are with Robin. The chest and torso come with Ivy, and the head, shoulders, and blaster are included with Batgirl. The likenesses overall are solid, with Batman and Freeze at the top overall. While the others don't look quite as close in likeness, they all boast great overall face sculpts. Each figure also comes with the usual trading card and figure base, but they don't seem to come with any individual accessories due to their inclusion of the Mr. Freeze figure. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Todd McFarlane (@toddmcfarlane) McFarlane doesn't reveal a release date for the figures, but odds are we will see them hitting stores relatively soon, as McFarlane shows them all in packaging already and even says these are production figures. It also remains to be seen if McFarlane will also create a Batman Forever series down the line, though that probably depends on if these sell well. At this point, you can almost get any major movie Batman in the Multiverse line, with Robert Pattinson, Ben Affleck, Christian Bale, and Michael Keaton all represented in some way or another. Val Kilmer is the only movie Batman who doesn't have a figure yet, and with the changed-up suit for Robin, Jim Carrey's Riddler, and Tommy Lee Jones's Two-Face, you could see getting a whole series based on that film. As for the Build-A-Figure, perhaps a Batman Forever-styled Batmobile would work. This is actually the perfect time for a new action figure line from the film, as it became a popular topic once more after Clooney made a surprise cameo as Bruce Wayne in this year's The Flash. The film has become infamous for its shift from the films that preceded it, but in a previous interview with Empire, Schwarzenegger said he doesn't regret making the film in the least . \"In most cases I don't regret the movies that failed or were not as good,\" Schwarzenegger said. \"It's always easy to be smug in hindsight, right?\" Schwarzenegger continued, saying, \"I don't regret it at all. I felt that the character was interesting and two movies before that one Joel Schumacher was at his height. So the decision-making process was not off. At the same time I was doing Eraser over there and Warner Bros. begged me to do the movie.\" In a previous interview with Entertainment Tonight, Thurman also had great things to say about the experience . \"That was a fantastic experience. I had to wear lots of rubber suits,\" Thurman said. \"I did not have a rubber mask. I had my own face. But I had some rubber appliances on my face sometimes. That was about as much rubber as I've ever worked with, personally.\" Are you excited for the new figures?

    "content": "BOULDER, Colo. \u2014 A judge ruled Friday that the man accused of killing 10 people at a Colorado supermarket in a 2021 rampage is mentally competent to stand trial. The decision allows the prosecution of Ahmad Al Aliwi Alissa to move forward. Judge Ingrid Bakke ruled that Alissa, who has schizophrenia, is able to understand court proceedings and contribute to his own defense. Bakke presided over a hearing last week to consider an August determination by experts at a state mental hospital that Alissa was competent after previous evaluations found otherwise. Alissa\u2019s defense attorney asked for the hearing to debate the finding. In her ruling, Bakke said she was convinced that, following forced medication, Alissa was more communicative and had a \u201cfar improved capacity to elucidate his reasoning and decision-making.\u201d That\u2019s a critical component of competency, which partly hinges on Alissa being able to make informed decisions in his own case, such as whether to testify himself. Alissa, 24, is charged with murder and multiple attempted murder counts after the shooting spree on March 22, 2021, in a crowded King Soopers Store in Boulder, about 30 miles (50 kilometers) northwest of Denver. Alissa has not yet been asked to enter a plea. Alissa allegedly began firing outside the grocery store, shooting at least one person in the parking lot before moving inside, employees told investigators. Employees and customers scrambled to escape the violence, some leaving loading docks in the back and others sheltering in nearby stores. A SWAT team took Alissa into custody. Authorities haven\u2019t yet disclosed a motive for the shooting. Alissa\u2019s mental condition improved this spring after he was forced under a court order to take medication to treat his schizophrenia, said a psychologist who testified for the prosecution last week. He was admitted to the state hospital in December 2021. Schizophrenia can shake someone\u2019s grasp on reality, potentially interfering in a legal defense in court. Mental competency does not mean he\u2019s been cured. Mental competency is also separate from pleading not guilty by reason of insanity, which is a claim that someone\u2019s mental health prevented them from understanding right from wrong when a crime was committed. Last year, the remodeled King Soopers reopened, with about half of those who worked there previously choosing to return.",

The EP\u2019s \u201c A WOMAN COMES INTO THE ROOM \u201d features a \u201870s poem by American poet Alice Notley. Giles says she initially discovered the poem through a track by acid house duo Medicine 8, but she wasn\u2019t able to find the record for 10 years. She recently unearthed it and decided she needed to do a \u201cdeep dive\u201d into it. While it was difficult to locate Medicine 8, she eventually found one of its artists. He dug into his old record collection and found that Notley was the poet on the song. Giles found Notley and got her permission to use her sample. Impressively, No Rules was entirely funded by selling digital collectibles on web3 and by raising Ethereum\u2014a truly innovative feat. The beatmaker, who is currently ranked No. 9 and was formerly rated No. 2 on the chart for top artists in web3, says she\u2019s been selling NFTs for almost two years. Giles believes that web3 won\u2019t be sustainable because many artists do not interact with the people buying their works, so she decided to \u201cflip the script.\u201d She did this by uploading her music to web3 the same way she would post her tracks on SoundCloud . In turn, she learned that there was an entire fan base on the technology side who would consistently buy her NFTs because they knew she was \u201cgoing to come back\u201d and release more. The multi-genre maestro connects daily with her NFT buyers through a telegram chat with about 150 people. This has allowed her to become close with her community and make friends with some of them. She even met bloody white and DEEGAN through mutual friends in the web3 space, and both artists are featured on the EP. Giles says they are \u201csmaller\u201d acts on NO RULES but there are also \u201clegends\u201d on it, such as Cakes Da Killa and Wreckno . Her web3 work has not only allowed her to make new connections but it has also proven to be profitable. Giles makes royalties on this secondary market, noting that it can be of big financial gain if one is consistent with it. She defines it as a \u201clong-term game.\u201d She has seen remarkable success through selling her NFTs as it has funded everything as far as marketing, recording feature costs, touring and more. The producer has the power to sell her NFTs and raise an abundance of Ethereum because she\u2019s been an independent artist throughout the majority of her career, giving her the rights to retail her catalog. \"I started [raving] so young. I was like 15,\" Mija says. \"When I went to my first rave, I was a full ... [+] kandi kid. Phoenix was wild. We had a big, big underground rave scene.\" Dylan Villarreal The heavyweight champion of genre-less music says the biggest advantages of being an independent artist are putting out music whenever and with whoever she wants, not having middlemen in her release process, not having people trying to guide where her art goes and not having her albums scrapped. Giles believes music makers should have autonomy over their own creativity. However, she does see the benefits of working with labels, which she does with smaller projects. An example of this is when she released \u201c Groove \u201d on LP Giobbi's Femme House imprint. The label provided her with a non-exclusive deal for the song, which was presented on the LP Giobbi x Insomniac Records Presents Femme House compilation . \u201cI want to collaborate with other artists, with other labels and [with] communities,\u201d Giles says. \u201cI want to be able to do that, but I don't ever want to do it exclusively. When you're able to do a non-exclusive, it's cool [because] we can work together in a few years if I want to remix this or do something.\u201d Giles believes that her purpose in life is to \u201cmake people feel good, make people feel seen and make them feel like they can express themselves without being judged.\u201d She tries to emulate this through her deejaying, noting that she feels in control of those spaces when performing. She adds that by giving off that energy in her sets, people reciprocate that vibe back and it fills the room. The genre-bending maven says her sound is less \u201ccurated or anticipated\u201d as it\u2019s based on different phases she has gone through in her life. Giles says it\u2019s cyclical and that each time she returns to a style, she has more knowledge from when she previously produced it. This allows her to become better at making those tunes by evolving her sound design. Her \u201cfk a genre\u201d concept began when she was 23 years old because she wanted to learn as much as possible. This ideology has certainly empowered her to transcend stylistic borders throughout her growth as an artist. \u201cWhat looks like I'm chaotic and doing all sorts of things at the same time\u2026I kind of am,\u201d Giles says. \u201cI feel like now, for the first time, I am actually honing in on my sound and figuring out what it sounds like instead of [making] a million random different things. It is starting to feel more cohesive. So I'm not sure if it's really intentional, but in the beginning, it was because I didn't know what I wanted to do yet and I wasn't sure where I stood.\u201d Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn .

    "description": "A website touts Shane Jenkins as the founder of a group that seeks to \"shed light on the January 6th defendants and the treatment they have faced from the government.\"",
    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 A Texas man who attacked the U.S. Capitol with a metal tomahawk \u2014 and is now the face of a website selling merchandise portraying jailed rioters as \u201cpolitical prisoners\u201d \u2014 was sentenced Friday to seven years behind bars. Shane Jenkins, 46, tried to smash a Capitol window with his tomahawk during the Jan. 6, 2021, siege. He also repeatedly threw makeshift weapons at police officers, hurling a desk drawer, a flagpole, a metal walking stick and a wooden pole with a spear-like point. A website touts Jenkins as the founder of a group that seeks to \u201cshed light on the January 6th defendants and the treatment they have faced from the government.\u201d The website sells T-shirts, hoodies, hats, tote bags and other merchandise with Jan. 6-themed slogans, including \u201cFree the J6 political prisoners\u201d and \u201cWant my vote? Help the J6ers.\u201d Another shirt for sale features former President Donald Trump\u2019s mugshot over the words \u201cIndicted we stand.\u201d The website also commemorates Jenkins\u2019 own role in the riot. It displays a cartoon avatar of Jenkins, nicknamed Skullet, and a logo depicting crossed tomahawks below a silhouette of the Capitol building. Prosecutors don\u2019t know how much money Jenkins has generated from the website\u2019s merchandise sales. But they said he has used another fundraising site to collect more than $118,000 in donations. \u201cFar from contemplating the harm he has caused, examining his conscience, feeling shame for his actions, and resolving to change, Jenkins has chosen to use his January 6 status to build a brand in order to garner money and attention,\u201d prosecutors wrote in a court filing. Defense attorney Dennis Boyle said Jenkins hasn\u2019t received money from the sale of Jan. 6 merchandise and doesn\u2019t own the site that sells it, although he couldn\u2019t say who does. U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta, who sentenced Jenkins, said it was \u201cshameful\u201d for him to capitalize on his role in the riot. The judge also rejected the notion that Jenkins and other jailed rioters are political prisoners who can\u2019t get a fair trial. \u201cNothing could be further from the truth,\u201d Mehta said. \u201cIt\u2019s all on video.\u201d Jenkins expressed remorse for his actions on Jan. 6, saying he got \u201ccaught up in the heat of the moment.\u201d \u201cI love this country,\u201d he told the judge. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not some crazed maniac set out to destroy this nation.\u201d Prosecutors had recommended a prison sentence of 19 years and eight months. They also asked the judge to impose a fine of at least $118,888, equaling the money Jenkins has publicly raised. Mehta denied their request for a fine. He also refused to impose a \u201cterrorism\u201d enhancement that would have significantly increased his sentencing guidelines. In March, a jury convicted Jenkins of charges including civil disorder and obstructing the Jan. 6 joint session of Congress for certifying the presidential election victory of Joe Biden, a Democrat, over Trump, a Republican. Jenkins flew from Houston to Washington, D.C., a day before Trump\u2019s rally near the White House on Jan. 6. Jenkins believed baseless claims that the 2020 presidential election had been stolen from Trump and envisioned that a \u201cmedieval melee style battle\u201d would erupt at the Capitol, prosecutors said. \u201cHis language invoked imagery of war and violent retribution, and his goal was to intimidate and retaliate against a government that would not install his preferred candidate,\u201d they wrote. Boyle said Jenkins\u2019 actions on Jan. 6 were motivated by a \u201cmisunderstanding about the election.\u201d \u201cThere remain many grifters out there who remain free to continue propagating the \u2018great lie\u2019 that Trump won the election, Donald Trump being among the most prominent,\u201d Boyle wrote. \u201cMr. Jenkins is not one of these individuals; he knows he was wrong.\u201d The defense lawyer said Jenkins endured a tumultuous, abusive upbringing to became a \u201cpillar in his community.\u201d When he was 20, Jenkins shot and killed his stepfather in self-defense after the man pointed a shotgun at him and made death threats, according to Boyle, who said Jenkins wasn\u2019t charged in the 1997 killing. Prosecutors acknowledged that Jenkins wasn\u2019t prosecuted for his stepfather\u2019s killing, but they said his \u201cextensive\u201d criminal record before Jan. 6 included assault convictions and shows he has a \u201cpenchant for violence.\u201d In July, Jenkins and 11 other inmates at the jail in Washington assaulted another Capitol riot defendant, Taylor Taranto, in a TV room, according to prosecutors. Taranto had been saying derogatory things about Ashli Babbitt, the rioter who was fatally shot by a police officer inside the Capitol, and Babbitt\u2019s mother, prosecutors said. Prosecutors have argued that Jenkins played a pivotal role in the Jan. 6 attack. He struck a windowpane six times with the spike end of the tomahawk that he had carried in a backpack. He pulverized and sprayed the shatter-resistant glass. \u201cAre we going in or not?\u201d he shouted at the crowd. After Jenkins stepped down from the window ledge, another rioter stepped in to break the window. \u201cIt is difficult to overstate the significance of Jenkins\u2019 actions at this location,\u201d prosecutors wrote. \u201cAs the first to attack this window, Jenkins crossed a line that had previously not been crossed at the (Lower West Terrace) \u2014 he had attacked the Capitol itself.\u201d Rioters eventually destroyed the window, allowing them to enter a conference room, where they made improvised weapons from the broken parts of wooden furniture. Mob members used the furniture pieces to attack police officers guarding an entrance in a tunnel on the Capitol\u2019s Lower West Terrace. More than 1,100 people have been charged with Jan. 6-related federal crimes. Approximately 800 of them have pleaded guilty or been convicted by juries or judges after trials in Washington. Over 650 have been sentenced, with roughly two-thirds of them receiving terms of imprisonment ranging from three days to 22 years, according to an Associated Press analysis of court records.",

    "content": "In this episode, the ComicBook Nation Crew reviews new horror films The Exorcist: Believer and Pet Sematary: Bloodlines as well as the much-anticipated premiere of Marvel's Loki Season 2 . PLUS: Reactions to Gen V Episode 4 , a full preview of WWE's Fastlane event, and the newest comics! The Exorcist: Believer Review (Photo: Universal Pictures) In his 2-star review of Exorcist: Believer , ComicBook Nation host Kofi Outlaw said the following: Exorcist: Believer captures the \"legacy\" of the original in name only \u2013 even after dragging the original film star Ellen Burstyn back into the franchise... an unbalanced mess of a story, that doesn't ever seem to know where to put its focus... The Exorcist: Believer feels like it will go down as an odd and misguided attempt at a direct sequel \u2013 one that fails to provide any new soul to the franchise... Loki Season 2 Review (Photo: Marvel Studios) In her Loki Season 2 review , ComicBook.com's Nicole Drum said the following: Loki may be one of the MCU's most innovative and significant offerings, and Season 2 of the series certainly maintains the spirit of the first season and pushes not only Loki's story but the future of the MCU forward. But like the Sacred Timeline itself, Loki Season 2 shows signs of coming apart in places with little bits that could stand refinement, reconsideration, or even just a strong bit of editing. Season 2 definitely doesn't suffer from some of the pitfalls that would make people continue to question if superhero fatigue is real or not, but through characterizations, pacing, and too much self-awareness, it definitely feels like a very different show. It's by no means bad, but it certainly feels like most of the fun will be in digesting each episode after the fact, rather than taking it in for what it is just while watching.

    "description": "Acting U.S. Secretary of Labor, Julie Su, has been in contact with both sides, and may take part in negotiations that are set to resume next Thursday in Oakland.",
    "content": "WALNUT CREEK, Calif. (KGO) -- On the last day of Kaiser workers' three-day strike, we're learning that the U.S. Department of Labor is getting involved to help bring an end to what is the largest health care strike in the U.S. history. Dave Regan, President of SEIU-UHW, addressed a crowd of striking Kaiser employees Friday morning at Kaiser Walnut Creek. \"Yes, (President Biden) supports the workers' collective bargaining work!\" said Regan. \"We got to run through the finish line. But we're winning this thing! Keep it up!\" Regan told employees that Acting U.S. Secretary of Labor, Julie Su, has been in contact with both sides, and may take part in negotiations that are set to resume next Thursday in Oakland. \"I think she played a valuable role. And I believe she will be willing to be involved to help us get an agreement,\" says Regan. RELATED: 75,000 Kaiser union workers walk off job on 1st day of strike over staffing issues, wages Kaiser employees took part in a planned three-day strike to raise concerns, in large part, over staffing shortages and to demand higher wages. A reported 75,000 workers took to the picket line, making this the largest healthcare strike in U.S. history. \"At the core of everything, we just don't have enough people to do the job,\" says Regan. \"Kaiser has refused to give us information we believe we are entitled to. That is why we think this is what's called, 'an unfair labor practice strike.'\" The union says the workload has increased, which impacts patient care. They want 10,000 new employees to be hired. In an email to ABC7 News on Tuesday, Kaiser claims the demand to hire 10,000 workers has been met, an assertion that Regan refutes. \"They say they have filled 10,000 positions. If you are really careful, most of that is people who are doing internal transfers,\" says Regan. \"They have not gotten there. They are parsing words. It's just not true.\" MORE: Kaiser strike: What it could mean for patients if 75,000 workers walk off job Kaiser declined interview requests with ABC7 News, stating it won't discuss details, \"out of respect for the bargaining process.\" But San Jose State University Professor Robert Ovetz has some concerns about the Biden administration's possible role in the negotiations. \"When the government steps in, they are stepping in effectively on the side of the employers,\" explains Professor Ovetz, who teaches political science. Ovetz, who is a union member himself, says the U.S. Department of Labor's involvement may force Kaiser back to the bargaining table. But he adds, when the government gets involved, it often forces workers to concede some of their demands. MORE: Gov. Newsom rejects bill to give unemployment checks to striking workers \"My concern here is that if they step in, and pressure the union not to strike a second time, that they may not achieve their main demand,\" he says. Still, Regan is optimistic that the end is in sight. \"It is not that it's too complicated, there are too many points of disagreement. It really is, this needs to be done. Let's do the right thing. We think we can have it done next week,\" says Regan. However, Regan did say if next week's negotiations fail, the coalition is planning an even longer strike beginning in November.

    "content": "The man charged with murder in the 1996 killing of Tupac Shakur knew the gravity of his arrest last week near his home on the outskirts of Las Vegas, according to police body camera footage released Friday. \u201cSo what they got you for, man?\u201d an officer asks Duane \u201cKeffe D\" Davis. \u201cBiggest case in Las Vegas history,\u201d Davis says, recounting the date that Shakur was gunned down \u2014 \u201cSeptember 7th, 1996.\u201d Police and prosecutors allege Davis was the mastermind behind the drive-by shooting near the Las Vegas Strip that killed Shakur at the age of 25. Now, more than 27 years later, Davis was handcuffed around the wrists and in ankle shackles in the backseat of Las Vegas police car headed toward a county jail, where he remains held without bond. \u201cI ain\u2019t worried,\" Davis told the officer. \"I ain\u2019t did (expletive).\u201d The police videos, totaling more than an hour of footage, show Davis arrested around sunrise on Sept. 29 while walking in his otherwise quiet neighborhood. \u201cHey, Keffe. Metro Police,\u201d an officer said. \u201cCome over here.\u201d Davis, holding a water bottle, cooperated as he was patted down and handcuffed next to an unmarked police vehicle. The 60-year-old had been a long-known suspect in the case. He publicly admitted his role in the killing in interviews ahead of his 2019 tell-all memoir, \u201cCompton Street Legend.\u201d His arrest came two months after police raided his home, renewing interest in one of hip-hop\u2019s most enduring mysteries. In the videos, Davis recalled the July 17 raid and peeking over a gate at the same time as a SWAT officer. He said his arrest that morning was much more low-key. As they drove on the freeway en route to police headquarters to interview Davis, he asks if he was followed the previous night. The officer says no. \u201cSo why you all didn\u2019t bring the media?\u201d Davis said. The officer asked why police would bring the media. \u201cThat\u2019s what you all do,\" Davis said. The self-described gangster from Compton, California, hasn\u2019t yet entered a plea in the case, and he denied a request from The Associated Press for an interview at the jail. His longtime lawyer in Los Angeles, Edi Faal, told AP he has no comment on Davis' behalf. Davis told police that he had moved to the Las Vegas area in January because of his wife's job. But the audio is redacted when police later ask him what he has been doing since the move. In an indictment unsealed last Friday in Clark County District Court, Davis is accused of orchestrating the killing of Shakur and providing his nephew, Orlando \u201cBaby Lane\u201d Anderson, with the gun to do it. Anderson, who denied involvement in Shakur's killing, died in 1998. Grand jurors also voted to add sentencing enhancements for the use of a deadly weapon and alleged gang activity. If Davis is convicted, that could add decades to his sentence. In Nevada, a person can be convicted of murder for helping another person commit the crime. Davis' first court appearance this week was cut short when he asked the judge for a postponement while he retains counsel in Las Vegas. He's due in court again Oct. 19. Authorities say Shakur\u2019s killing stemmed from a rivalry and competition for dominance in a musical genre that, at the time, was dubbed \u201cgangsta rap.\u201d It pitted West Coast members of a Crips sect that Davis has said he led in Compton against East Coast members of a Bloods gang sect associated with rap music mogul Marion \u201cSuge\u201d Knight, founder of Death Row Records, the music label representing Shakur at the time of his death. ___ Antczak reported from Los Angeles.

    "description": "Ariana Madix has bounced back from the Tom Sandoval cheating scandal, according to Lala Kent.",
    "content": "Lala Kent believes Ariana Madix is \"thriving\". The 38-year-old star split from Tom Sandoval earlier this year, after it emerged that he had a months-long affair with Raquel Leviss - but Lala is convinced that Ariana is now in a good place, as she competes on 'Dancing with the Stars'. Lala, 33, told The Messenger: \"She's definitely thriving. This is the best thing that ever happened to her.\" Ariana has a new boyfriend called Daniel, and Lala is thrilled that she's managed to move on from the cheating scandal. Lala - who starred alongside Ariana on 'Vanderpump Rules' - said: \"He seems like a very nice guy.\" Ariana recently claimed that her 'Dancing with the Stars' experience has helped her to move on from Tom. The reality star explained to 'Entertainment Tonight': \"I love to perform; I love to be on stage, and it\u2019s just nice to be kind of over here and doing this with the best partner. You know?\" Ariana has also cherished the support of her new boyfriend, who has sat among the audience every week. She shared: \"It\u2019s really, really nice. He's so supportive. \"So many of my best friends were here tonight, and they're just the best. And I'm so lucky I just feel like somehow, somewhere, the cosmic universe, whatever, I won the lottery when it comes to the best friends and the best support system. Truly.\" Meanwhile, Tom recently confessed that he regrets hurting Ariana. He said on the 'Everybody Loves Tom' podcast: \"I would never, ever want to hurt somebody like that. Even like my worst enemy. But I think that\u2019s why sometimes you end up hurting those people you care about the most is because of your strong connection with them.\"",

    "description": "Hollywood star Brie Larson has revealed that she relished making 'Lessons in Chemistry'.",
    "content": "Brie Larson loved having a hands-on role in the making of 'Lessons in Chemistry'. The 34-year-old actress has had an influence on both sides of the camera since the outset, and Brie has really relished the extra responsibility. The actress - who stars in the drama mini-series and also executive produces the show - told 'Entertainment Tonight': \"This is the first scripted series that I have developed from the beginning and will be through until the end. \"So being part of this collaboration and given the opportunity to have a voice besides just showing up and knowing my lines and doing the acting part of the job but getting to talk more about the script and the series as a whole, being on the edit when I'm not here on set, getting to be a part of all of it. \"I love the teamwork of the job and I like seeing it through so it works for me, that's kind of how my brain works is I want to be able to be there from the very beginning to go, 'OK, let's work on the script because this is where I want to go with this character,' and to have a team that's open to that.\" Brie plays the part of Elizabeth Zott - a chemist-turned-feminist-chef who fights against misogyny - on the show. The actress found that she was really able to relate to her on-screen character. She said: \"I relate to her in so many different ways but one of the things is just her resilience and how much life she goes through. And so the show gets to explore that and it kind of goes into everything - life as a whole, love, loss, chemistry, what it means to be alive on this planet. \"It goes through a lot, but does it in a way that is so sweet and buoyant and that is what I loved about the book because you kind of were caught off guard by how many weighty topics were in it because you always felt like it was buoyant and never got too self-serious.\"",

The comedian reluctantly celebrated the latest landmark during an appearance on 'The View' on Friday (06.10.23), when Joy was encouraged to embrace the moment by her co-stars. Sunny Hostin, who is one of Joy's co-hosts, noted that the veteran TV star \"[didn't] look excited\" about her birthday. Joy - who turns 81 on Saturday - then quipped: \"I can't get excited. I'm just glad I\u2019m alive, okay? \"You know, you get to a point where you wake up in the morning saying, 'I'm still here, my God!'\" During the show, the co-hosts were presented with a cannoli cake from Veniero's Pastry to mark the occasion. Joy joked: \"They've been around since the year I was born, 1894! Please check them out because they deliver nationwide and I don't want to be the only one indulging today. Cannoli cream is the best!\" In 2022, Joy insisted that she didn't have any retirement plans. The TV star loves her job and remains committed to 'The View'. She told PEOPLE: \"I just signed a contract so I'll be here for a while. I have no plans to retire.\" Joy feels proud of the show's success and revealed that she doesn't have any intention of walking away anytime soon. The co-host - who is the only original panellist who still appears on 'The View' - shared: \"It's really, you know, something that is an important show in many ways. Sometimes I don't believe that, as I've been here since the beginning, but we're the most-watched show in daytime. Most-watched! \"I'm happy to be a part of it. So no, I'm not going anywhere.

The 39-year-old singer and David, 73, have recorded a new version of 'Amazing Grace', and Katharine has revealed that the married couple had a \"debate\" before they agreed to put the song on their new album. The singer - who is set to release the second part of their 'Christmas Songs' album later this month - told 'Entertainment Tonight': \"We argued a little bit, not in the bad way. It\u2019s a bit of a debate over whether we should do \u2018Amazing Grace\u2019 because I said, 'It\u2019s not a Christmas song, it\u2019s a religious song.' \"The label ended up actually really liking it because we\u2019re using it as our first single to kind of get out there, kind of earlier before the whole Christmas craze without it beating you over the head that it\u2019s a Christmas song. So it\u2019s actually kind of cool that we did it.\" The loved-up duo have also toured together this year, and they've relished performing with each other on stage. David said: \"It\u2019s been great.\" Despite this, Katharine admits that it hasn't been entirely straightforward. The singer confessed that she's already grown weary of the constant traveling. The brunette beauty - who competed on 'American Idol' back in 2006 - said: \"Being together has not been the shlep. Just the constant packing and unpacking. \"You wake up in a new city every day and it\u2019s just a grind. That\u2019s the only part that sometimes wears on you.

    "content": "It's another home game for Manchester United as they look to avoid a three-match losing streak in all competitions when they welcome Brentford. Hampered with injuries, United are coming off of losing to Crystal Palace and Galatasaray and could be entering the international break in the bottom half of the Premier League, which would be as close to rock bottom as the club can get. Brentford are also on a poor run, winless in their last seven matches, and while Ivan Toney has returned to training, he won't be able to return to the pitch to help the Bees in the match. Here's our storylines, how you can watch the match and more: Question number one for Erik ten Hag is who plays left back? During Champions League, Sofyan Amrabat had to play out of position and the defense was in shambles. Doing the same against Brentford would be a recipe for disaster but with Sergio Reguilon still injured, ten Hag will need to get creative. If Amrabat does end up playing left back again, not only will he need coverage but Rasmus Hojlund will need to score a hat trick to end up getting by Brentford. Also down to bare bones in defense, Brentford have been looking for a way to right their attack without giving up too many goals and a trip to United could prove to be just what Thomas Frank needed. Even when struggling, the Bees are a dangerous team and if they can get chances from set plays, United will struggle. Manchester United's doldrums continue as they share points with Brentford at home. Manchester United 2, Brentford 2",

    "content": "Megan Rapinoe said in a game with playoff implications. OL Reign set a new NWSL attendance record as 34,130 fans packed Lumen Field in Seattle, Washington to thank Rapinoe in her final home match before retiring, and it ended in a 0-0 draw with the Washington Spirit. The result leaves their playoff fate up in the air, setting up an opportunity for fans to witness one more game for Rapinoe on the road against Chicago Red Stars with so much on the line. Depending on remaining games for other clubs, the Reign's final match against Chicago may determine whether or not they advance to the postseason at all. So for fans who still aren't quite ready to say goodbye, there's still time and hope for another magical Rapinoe moment. \"This was just always the place where I could be myself and be safe and be protected and just go out and try stuff,\" Rapinoe said to the crowd after the game. \"This was kind of my little training ground for other things that were on different stages. To be able to play here my whole career in one city ... just really special to be able to have this. So, just thank you to everyone. Hopefully a lot more to come this season. Certainly, a lot more to come after this season. I feel like in so many ways this is just the beginning.\" Here's how you can watch Rapinoe's final regular season NWSL match: The final match of the regular season will come down to a Decision Day scenario for sixth-place OL Reign and other clubs. San Diego Wave FC is the only team to have secured a spot in the playoffs but is still battling for a first-round bye, and the 2023 NWSL Shield -- awarded to the winningest team of the season. While no team can clinch the shield during this week, a playoff bye is still in play for San Diego, Portland or NJ/NY Gotham. The league table has never been closer with five playoff spots still up for grabs heading into the final weekend. OL Reign's draw against the Spirit, and a loss by Orlando Pride, gives them a little wiggle room. They cannot be knocked out of contention with the remaining games on Saturday and Sunday.

    "description": "Grilled cheese is a gooey fall favorite sandwich with plenty of ways to enhance it. Add cheese sticks to your next grilled cheese for the ultimate comfort food.",
    "content": "Grilled cheese is undeniably one of the most satisfying because it checks all the right boxes. It's a symphony of cheesy, buttery goodness encased in a crispy toast. Plus, it's one of the easiest dishes to prepare, making it accessible to almost anyone, even those who consider themselves kitchen novices. However, if you've never ventured into the realm of adding mozzarella sticks to your , you're truly missing out on a world of flavors. If you're already a fan of these crunchy, gooey sticks paired with marinara sauce, you probably need persuasion to try this combination. Yet, there are several compelling reasons why adding mozzarella sticks can elevate your grilled cheese game in terms of flavor and texture. First, when properly fried, mozzarella sticks develop a pleasing, crisp exterior that brings an exciting contrast to your sandwich. Second, adding mozzarella cheese contributes to that sought-after cheese pull, which is the hallmark of the perfect grilled cheese. Moreover, the creamy nature of mozzarella complements the nutty cheddar or smooth American cheese beautifully. Some preparation is required to infuse mozzarella sticks into your grilled cheese creation. You can't simply add to your bread and cheese slices before grilling; they need to be cooked separately first. The most effective way to cook mozzarella sticks at home is by using an . Consider using three to four mozzarella sticks for a standard grilled cheese sandwich. Monitoring the cooking time is essential to prevent the mozzarella cheese from oozing out of the sticks. Once done, let the mozzarella sticks cool slightly before adding them to the grilled cheese. While the mozzarella sticks are air frying, assemble and prepare your ingredients for the . After you've added half of the cheese to the bottom slice of bread, add the air-fried mozzarella sticks on top and then top with more cheese and the final piece of bread. While mozzarella cheese might not be the first choice for many when making grilled cheese, with American cheese and cheddar being more popular options, it's a fantastic choice to enhance the sandwich's overall appeal. The unique stretching process during its production results in a stretchiness that lends a delightful dimension to a grilled cheese sandwich. If you've ever witnessed the making of mozzarella cheese, you'll know that the stretching step transforms it into the gooey, stringy cheese we adore on pizza. This makes it an ideal addition to any grilled cheese. But, if you want to take things a step further, you could skip cheddar or American cheese and add more mozzarella or another great melting cheese like Fontina. Then, add a spoonful of marinara sauce to create a grilled cheese that tastes just like a plate of mozzarella sticks.",

Savage\u2019s lawyer, Charles Kuck, told The Associated Press in a statement Friday that his client has officially become a permanent U.S. resident and may now go overseas. He cleared a major traveling hurdle after being taken into custody by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in Georgia in 2019. Kuck said the Grammy-nominated artist followed \u201call applicable immigration laws since his initial detention by ICE.\u201d \u201cHis immigration court proceedings have now been terminated and he is a lawful permanent resident of the United States with the freedom to travel internationally,\u201d Kuck said. Savage, 30, whose given name is She\u2019yaa Bin Abraham-Joseph, spent 10 days in a detention center in southern Georgia before his release. He was arrested in a targeted operation over his visa, which expired in 2006. The Atlanta-based rapper said he had no idea what a visa was when his mother brought him to the U.S. at 7 years old. He said in a 2019 interview with the AP that immigrants like him who lived in America illegally as children should automatically become U.S. citizens. Savage said the visa application process discourages many immigrants who don\u2019t have documents because it \u201changs over your head forever.\u201d Savage made his announcement about returning to London via social media but did not give details.",

    "content": "STRAX Price Soars 85% Amid Upbit Dominance and Whales\u2019 Activity This significant spike in value has caught the attention of the cryptocurrency market, raising questions about its underlying causes and potential implications. What\u2019s particularly striking is that approximately 82% of today\u2019s trading volume for STRAX originates from the popular exchange Upbit. This concentration of activity on a single exchange has raised eyebrows within the crypto community. Furthermore, a wallet has accumulated a staggering 1.8 million STRAX tokens in the past 12 hours, representing approximately 1.2% of the total supply. This sizeable accumulation has added another layer of intrigue to the sudden price surge, according to data. Stratis\u2019s Impact Beyond Price Surge Stratis, the blockchain platform behind STRAX, offers businesses the ability to create applications on private blockchains, distinguishing itself with a practical approach. Notably, the Stratis development team goes beyond platform creation, providing consulting services to guide businesses in leveraging advanced blockchain technology. While the STRAX price soars, it\u2019s essential to exercise caution, as it may be linked to significant token accumulation by large investors. This situation calls for vigilance among traders and investors, emphasizing the need for thorough research before engaging in any transactions involving STRAX. The Stratis project, established in 2016, continues to evolve, demonstrating its commitment to practical blockchain solutions and adoption. Despite its particularly low profile in the industry, Stratis may hold the potential to deliver a substantial impact in the future.",

Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin FC Barcelona continue to monitor Estevao Willian at Palmeiras, who is known as 'Little Messi'. Twitter FC Barcelona are still interested in signing Palmeiras pearl Estevao Willian, who is known locally as 'Messinho' or 'Little Messi', according to Mundo Deportivo . The 16-year-old has tongues wagging once more for his latest display in a Brasileirao U17 match against Fluminense. Estevao Willian played a part in all four goals in the fixture as his team won 4-2. Scoring two goals and providing two assists, one of his strikes was a powerful header and the other a thunderous free kick. At one stage in the game, the woodwork denied him a hat trick when he let off another ripping dead ball. The teenager had already caught the attention of Europe's top clubs before this display, with Paris Saint-Germain having a \u20ac50 million ($53 million) bid for him turned down in recent months. Sao Paulo giants Palmeiras know the value of their prodigies, and how much moneyed outfits from the Old Continent are willing to pay for them after selling Endrick to Real Madrid in a deal that could reach \u20ac60 million ($63.6 million) last December. In Catalonia, Barca and their Brazil-born sporting director Deco are also great admirers of Estevao Willian and continue to monitor his progress. Earlier this summer, Deco was key in landing another South American promise in Vitor Roque, who should join Barca in January for a fixed fee of \u20ac30 million ($31.8 million) plus \u20ac31 million ($32.9 million) in variables from Athletico Paranaense.

Barca might struggle to raise the funds to buy him in 2024, but could agree something similar to the Vitor Roque deal with a good amount of fixed cash and a healthy sum in variables that would come Palmeiras' way at a later date. Swinging in the Blagurana's favor is that Estevao Willian has already told Mundo Deportivo it is his \"dream\" to play for Barca, and follow in the footsteps of his idol and nickname near-namesake Lionel Messi. This means that he might turn down offers from elsewhere, and wait for Deco and his team to make an approach in the coming months. Follow me on Twitter .

Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin WASHINGTON, DC \u2013 DECEMBER 4: Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL) speaks during testimony by constitutional ... [+] scholars before the House Judiciary Committee in the Longworth House Office Building on Capitol Hill December 4, 2019 in Washington, DC. This is the first hearing held by the Judiciary Committee in the impeachment inquiry against U.S. President Donald Trump, whom House Democrats say held back military aid for Ukraine while demanding it investigate his political rivals. The Judiciary Committee will decide whether to draft official articles of impeachment against President Trump to be voted on by the full House of Representatives. (Photo by Saul Loeb-Pool/Getty Images) Getty Images It is increasingly debated that the current generation of politicians, notably in the two Anglo-Saxon countries, are markedly inferior to those of prior generations \u2013 intellectually, morally and in their commitment to public service. Rory Stewart\u2019s new book (Politics on the Edge) highlights a number of examples. This is a view I have some sympathy for and a more compelling argument, supported by most politicians I have met, is that social media has debased politics and political debate, to the extent that the untrue and absurd garner greater attention from potential voters. Speeches at the Tory party conference last week (e.g. Penny Mordaunt) and the toppling of Kevin McCarthy by Matt Gaetz, are instances. One of many litmus tests of this hypothesis is that the quality and quantity of pithy, quotable remarks by political leaders and policymakers appears to have diminished. Outside of set-piece speeches there seems to be far fewer impressively intelligent public utterances from those in public life. As a result, essay writers are left digging for lesser used quotes from Churchill with which to start their notes. This is a pity, not just for essay writers, but for the public at large. Speeches Often, when those essay writers have exhausted the reservoir of Churchill quotes, they dip into Keynes. I recently happened upon a deep pool of quips from Keynes in Benn Steil\u2019s \u2018The Battle of Bretton Woods\u2019, which is a superb account of the tussle between Britain and America to shape the new world financial order and with it, bodies like the IMF. Tussle is too generous a word, the meeting effectively formalised the transfer of \u2018world power\u2019 from Britain to the US, or as Keynes wrote to his mother \u2018 In another year\u2019s time we shall have forfeited the claim we had staked out in the New World and in exchange this country will be mortgaged to America \u2019.

WWE SmackDown Results: Winners And Grades On October 6, 2023 23andMe User Data Stolen And Listed For Sale In Attack Targeting Ashkenazi Jews Keynes\u2019 prominent role at Bretton Woods was as foil to the American negotiator Harry Dexter White, and Keynes felt his place was to negotiate a deal for Britain that would rescue it from \u2018 losing face altogether and appearing to capitulate completely to dollar diplomacy .\u201d For some, Keynes was living proof of Lord Halifax\u2019 view that \u2018 they have all the money, and we have all the brains\u2019 . End of Eloquence From this point onwards, American financial dominance grew, manifested in the broad international use of its currency which has risen to a very particular place as the linchpin of the financial system. Indeed, one of the most important tenets of the twentieth-century world order and the rise of globalization has been the position of the dollar as the international reserve currency. This pre-eminence was christened in another memorable quote as \u2018exorbitant privilege\u2019 by Valery Giscard d\u2019Estaing, then French finance minister and later President. When Giscard made this statement, the dollar was tied to gold, and the response from France and a number of other countries was to exchange their holdings of dollars for gold. This set the stage for the subsequent breaking of the dollar\u2019s tie to gold by President Nixon. Since then, the dollar has been first among equals in the currency world, and many developing nations have pegged their currencies to it. Recently, as we have noted before, this notion of \u2018exorbitant privilege\u2019 has come under scrutiny in the sense that there is a long line of commentators predicting the demise of the dollar. A more interesting line of argument, thanks again to some French wizards (Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas and H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Rey) is the notion of \u2018exorbitant duty\u2019, which is the role that the dollar and US financial system play in times of crisis as the provider of a safe haven, even when those crises emanate from the US itself. As it stands, the next largest currency bloc to the dollar, the euro doesn\u2019t have capital markets deep enough to become a fully fledged global safe haven. It might be that a group of smaller countries \u2013 Switzerland and Australia for instance could also draw in capital in a crisis. So, the dollar may continue to do its duty, until perhaps it is undermined from within. While few in Washington will feel sorry for Kevin McCarthy, his removal represents another step towards the political unknown in America. Europeans and Asians are starting to worry about the prospect that Donald Trump could become president again and that the US might one day fail to do its \u2018duty\u2019. Congress has got it wrong before. One of the comments in the Steil book recounts how after Bretton Woods \u2018 Congress was spontaneously more generous toward China than toward England, perhaps because no one envisaged China as a postwar rival for power or commerce .\u201d Mike O'Sullivan Editorial Standards Print Reprints & Permissions",

    "description": "Exclusive interviews with Daniel Ellsberg and a long-buried memo reveal new details about one of the 20th century's biggest scoops. The post How Neil Sheehan Really Got the Pentagon Papers appeared first on The Intercept.",
    "content": "of March 23, 1971, New York Times reporter Neil Sheehan excitedly called Max Frankel, the Times\u2019s Washington bureau chief, to give him the news he had been waiting weeks to hear. \u201cI got it all,\u201d Sheehan told Frankel. Sheehan had just accomplished one of the greatest journalistic coups of the 20th century. He had obtained the Pentagon Papers, the Defense Department\u2019s 7,000-page secret history of the Vietnam War, which revealed that the government had been lying to the American people about the brutal conflict since it began. It was the first mass leak of classified documents in modern American journalism, four decades before WikiLeaks and Edward Snowden. But Sheehan had lied to his source, Daniel Ellsberg, a disillusioned former defense analyst turned whistleblower, to get the documents. He had secretly copied them after he had promised Ellsberg he wouldn\u2019t. Sheehan confessed to his editors that he had \u201cXeroxed the materials without permission and the source was unaware that he had done so,\u201d according to a remarkable and previously unpublished 1971 legal memo obtained by The Intercept. When confronted by an anxious Times lawyer, Sheehan insisted that the Pentagon Papers \u201cwere not stolen, but copied,\u201d according to the memo. The long-buried memo contains Sheehan\u2019s contemporaneous and confidential account of his relationship with Ellsberg, as well as Sheehan\u2019s version of events inside the Times as it prepared to publish the Pentagon Papers. It offers an unprecedented, real-time depiction of Sheehan\u2019s actions \u2014 including his phone call to Frankel and his admission to his editors that he had lied to his source. For decades after the Times published the Pentagon Papers, Daniel Ellsberg quietly seethed about what he saw as the deceitful way he was treated by Sheehan and the newspaper. He was furious when he discovered that Sheehan had lied to him repeatedly, and he remained mystified as to why Sheehan had misled him in ways that Ellsberg felt violated the basic tenets of a reporter-source relationship. To Ellsberg, the lies seemed gratuitous, as when Sheehan told him that the Times hadn\u2019t decided whether it was really interested in the Pentagon Papers, even as Sheehan and other reporters were furiously drafting stories based on the documents that Sheehan had secretly copied. He only found out that Sheehan had been lying to him when he was alerted by someone else at the Times the day before the first Pentagon Papers stories were splashed across the front page of the June 13, 1971, edition. Sheehan\u2019s behavior has been \u201ca great puzzle for me for 50 years,\u201d Ellsberg said in an interview conducted just months before he died in June at the age of 92. \u201cWhy did Neil Sheehan not tell me that the Times was coming out with this stuff?\u201d In his final months, Ellsberg was eager to talk \u2014 at greater length and in far more detail than ever before \u2014 about the dramatic backstory of the Pentagon Papers, and especially about his intense and volatile relationship with Sheehan and the newspaper. That relationship is further detailed in the newly unearthed memo, which is historically significant because it is based on confidential conversations between Sheehan and his lawyer in the days immediately after the Pentagon Papers were published. Mitchell Rogovin, Sheehan\u2019s lawyer in 1971, wrote the 14-page memo describing how Sheehan had obtained the documents, based on Rogovin\u2019s discussions with Sheehan right after the publication of the Pentagon Papers. At the time the memo was drafted, a federal grand jury in Boston was considering whether to indict Sheehan and the Times in connection with the publication of the classified documents. Rogovin wrote the memo for James Goodale, then the Times\u2019s general counsel, while both the Times and Sheehan were fighting the government\u2019s efforts to charge them. The Boston grand jury was disbanded without ever charging Sheehan or the Times, but the memo has survived, buried in legal files, and is only now being made public, long after the deaths of both Sheehan and Rogovin. Goodale mentioned the Rogovin memo and briefly quoted from it in his 2013 memoir, \u201cFighting for the Press,\u201d but The Intercept is publishing the full document here for the first time. \u201cIn February of 1971 Neil Sheehan was offered what has since been called the \u2018Pentagon Papers,\u2019\u201d the memo begins. \u201cHis source would make these materials available to the Times if it \u2018would handle it properly\u2019 \u2014 certain conditions were set forth.\u201d One Times editor told Sheehan that he was trying to obtain \u201cthe journalistic hydrogen bomb.\u201d The Rogovin memo and Ellsberg\u2019s extensive interviews in his final months offer competing views of what happened from the two main protagonists in the Pentagon Papers saga. Along with new interviews with other key figures, they offer a clearer and more nuanced view of the story behind one of the most significant events in American journalism. The publication of the Pentagon Papers is the origin story of the modern New York Times in the same way that Watergate is the origin story of the modern Washington Post. The decision to publish the classified documents transformed the Times from a staid centerpiece of the American establishment to a far more aggressive and professional news organization that no longer saw itself solely as a purveyor of official statements and authorized leaks. With the Pentagon Papers, adversarial journalism became the Times\u2019s ambition, rather than just an accidental byproduct of its conventional reportage. The backstory of how the Pentagon Papers ended up at the Times \u2014 and particularly the fraught relationships between Ellsberg, Sheehan, and the Times \u2014 has never been fully told. That is due in part to the fact that the Times, like most news organizations, has long resisted thoroughly recounting its own history. The newspaper is reluctant to shatter the myths that have grown up around its most famous act of journalism. That hidden backstory is complicated and messy, and for many years, none of the people involved wanted to speak publicly about what really happened. For his part, Ellsberg was happy that the Times actually published the documents, and he forgave Sheehan for his lies, even though he did not quite forget them. Despite his age, Ellsberg\u2019s memory was sharp during interviews conducted near the end of his life both for The Intercept and for my book, \u201c ,\u201d as he recounted the stunning story behind the historic leak, one that revealed his risk-taking and persistence as he stubbornly navigated the analog world of the late 1960s and early 1970s to reveal government secrets. Ellsberg did this in an era of rigid orthodoxy, when the idea of revealing classified material was considered heresy and terrified every political leader in Washington, even those deeply opposed to the Vietnam War. The defining moment in Ellsberg\u2019s life came when he finally succeeded in getting the story out and found himself at the center of a political firestorm sparked by the first mass leak of classified documents by a whistleblower in American history. Ultimately, Ellsberg became an iconic figure, an activist for democracy and press freedom; his fame was enhanced by the Nixon administration\u2019s decision to prosecute him for leaking the Pentagon Papers, followed by the revelation of the burglary of his psychiatrist\u2019s office by the infamous White House Plumbers, which led to the dismissal of his legal case and was a precursor to the Watergate scandal. Yet his prominence only served to worsen his ragged relationship with the Times, which didn\u2019t want to share the spotlight with its source. For decades after the publication of the Pentagon Papers, the Times distanced itself from Ellsberg. The newspaper\u2019s identity and status became so wrapped up in the groundbreaking stories that some at the paper were angry that Ellsberg\u2019s fame overshadowed the Times\u2019s and diluted the credit they thought was due the newspaper for its decision to publish the documents. \u201cHe stole our glory,\u201d Goodale said in an interview. At first, Daniel Ellsberg didn\u2019t intend to go to the press. For the man who would be remembered as one of the greatest sources in the history of American journalism, the press was a last resort. Before he became a world-famous rebel, Ellsberg was in the process of building a blue-chip career that easily could have taken him to the top of the American establishment. Born in Chicago in 1931, Ellsberg grew up in Detroit, went to Harvard, and served as an officer in the Marines before joining the RAND Corporation, an influential defense-oriented think tank, where he worked as an analyst focusing on nuclear strategy. He earned a doctorate in economics, specializing in decision theory, and by 1964, he was a staffer at the Pentagon under the ultimate technocrat, Defense Secretary Robert McNamara. He later spent two years in South Vietnam working under Gen. Edward Lansdale, who tried and failed to apply the counterinsurgency and psychological warfare tactics he had used in the Philippines in the 1950s to the Vietnam War. His time in Vietnam convinced Ellsberg that the murderous war could not be won. After returning to RAND in 1967, Ellsberg joined other analysts to work on a secret, 47-volume history of the war commissioned by McNamara. To help write the history, Ellsberg gained access to highly classified documents that revealed in stunning detail the deceit at the heart of U.S. policy in Vietnam. Ellsberg realized that the American people needed to know the truth. He came to believe that exposing the secret history could help end the war. In September 1969, he covertly took a copy of the Pentagon Papers from RAND. Along with his friend Anthony Russo and Russo\u2019s girlfriend, Linda Sinay, Ellsberg began to copy the Pentagon Papers, while trying to decide how best to publicize their findings. After talking with a lawyer about the odds that he would be prosecuted for leaking the documents, Ellsberg said that he calculated that he was less likely to be charged for giving the papers to a member of Congress than he would be if he gave them to the press. He also believed that congressional hearings would give the Pentagon Papers greater credibility and have a bigger impact than stories in a newspaper. He first turned to Sen. J. William Fulbright. Ellsberg sought out the Arkansas Democrat in November 1969 because he was the powerful chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and had led congressional hearings that gave voice to the war\u2019s skeptics. Ellsberg took the risk of providing some of the Pentagon Papers to Fulbright in a meeting with the senator\u2019s staff present. \u201cI wanted them all to witness that [Fulbright] had held some of these papers, so he couldn\u2019t say afterwards, \u2018Oh, that was some staff thing\u2019\u201d that the senator didn\u2019t personally know about, Ellsberg recalled in an interview. \u201cSo, in front of everybody, I hand him this thing.\u201d Ellsberg gave Fulbright highly classified sections of the Pentagon Papers relating to U.S. diplomacy that he later refused to give Sheehan and the Times because he thought they were too sensitive to be published in a newspaper, according to the Rogovin memo. But after initially expressing interest, Fulbright backed off, fearful of the consequences of going public with stolen classified material. In December 1970, Fulbright finally told Ellsberg he wasn\u2019t going to do anything with the documents. Ellsberg tried other lawmakers in early 1971, believing that Congress was the safest and most effective place for him to make the Pentagon Papers public, but he was repeatedly rebuffed, including by Sen. George McGovern, the anti-war liberal Democrat from South Dakota who later ran for president; Sen. Gaylord Nelson, a liberal Democrat from Wisconsin; and Sen. Charles Mathias, a liberal Democrat from Maryland. Ellsberg had na\u00efvely hoped that his efforts to publicize the documents would remain secret even as he was rather recklessly talking to so many different senators. But inevitably, his conversations on Capitol Hill were soon shared. When Ellsberg talked with McGovern again a week after their initial meeting, McGovern told him that he and Nelson had compared notes and found that they were both talking to Ellsberg about the Pentagon Papers. \u201cHe tells me he\u2019s talked to Gaylord Nelson,\u201d Ellsberg recalled. McGovern said that when he\u2019d told Nelson about the classified documents he had been offered, Nelson responded: \u201cWas that Ellsberg?\u201d Discouraged, Ellsberg was having lunch in the Senate cafeteria by himself when he recognized I.F. Stone, the famous independent journalist, sitting at a nearby table. Ellsberg was a fan of Stone. \u201cI recognized [Stone] by his bottle glasses,\u201d Ellsberg recalled. \u201cAnd so I decided to tell him what I was doing. \u2018I have these top-secret documents, the whole history of the war.\u2019\u201d Ellsberg poured out his frustrations to Stone about his inability to get any prominent senator to go public with the Pentagon Papers. \u201cHe looked at me, and he did have tears in his eyes, and he said, \u2018God bless you for what you\u2019re doing.\u2019\u201d Even as he continued to try to get someone in Congress to take action, Ellsberg turned to a left-wing Washington-based think tank, the Institute for Policy Studies. In August 1970, he gave the group about 1,000 pages of the 7,000-page history. One of the organization\u2019s leaders was Marcus Raskin \u2014 the father of Rep. Jamie Raskin, a Maryland Democrat who played a leading role in the House investigation of the January 6, 2021, insurrection. Ellsberg agreed to let Marcus Raskin and two others at IPS \u2014 Richard Barnet and Ralph Stavins \u2014 use the documents for a book they were working on about the Vietnam War, as long as they did so only on background, meaning they wouldn\u2019t acknowledge publicly that they possessed the classified history or quote from it directly. Without Ellsberg\u2019s knowledge, the IPS researchers gave a copy of the 1,000 pages to Neil Sheehan. Rep. Jamie Raskin said in an interview that his father gave Sheehan copies of the Pentagon Papers because he was frustrated that Ellsberg was being too cautious and taking too long to make them public. \u201cI recall my dad telling me that he urged Dan to go public as quickly as possible,\u201d Raskin said. \u201cAt a certain point my dad decided to share the Pentagon Papers with New York Times reporter Neil Sheehan to hasten public exposure of the criminality of the war.\u201d Decades later, Marcus Raskin finally told Ellsberg what had happened: Raskin said that he and the other IPS researchers thought they had secretly reached a deal with Sheehan. In return for giving the Times the documents, Sheehan had told Raskin and the other IPS researchers that the Times would agree to coordinate the publication of its stories based on the documents with the release of the think tank\u2019s book on Vietnam. In addition, Sheehan agreed to two other conditions: On the same day that the Times published its stories on the documents, it would also publish a review of the think tank\u2019s book and a column by Raskin about U.S. war crimes in Vietnam. Raskin, Barnet, and Stavins had originally proposed the deal to Sheehan, who said that he would have to check with his editors before he could agree to the conditions. Sheehan later told Raskin and the others that the Times editors had approved the deal, so the IPS researchers gave him the documents. But the Times did not abide by that deal, and there is no evidence that Sheehan ever actually talked to any of his editors about it. By the time Raskin and Barnet finally told Ellsberg about their supposed deal with Sheehan, he had long known , and he had been angry for years that they had done so behind his back. But Ellsberg found that they were also bitter over what they saw as Sheehan\u2019s betrayal. \u201cI learned from Raskin and Barnet, bit by bit, but then, all of it, the story\u201d of what had happened, Ellsberg said. \u201cThey gave [the documents] to him, both Raskin and Barnet told me, on a deal that probably no newspaper had ever made, before or since.\u201d Ellsberg said he was flabbergasted. \u201c\u2018Jeez,\u2019 I said to Raskin, \u2018is there any newspaper that ever made a deal like that?\u2019 And he said, \u2018No, but those were our conditions for giving him the stuff.\u2019\u201d \u201cRaskin was very firm on this point,\u201d Ellsberg said. \u201cHe said, \u2018Absolutely, we had those conditions, he agreed, and they betrayed us.\u2019\u201d When he asked why they had not told him about this supposed deal decades earlier, Ellsberg said that Barnet admitted that they had felt humiliated by the entire episode. \u201cI learned this 30 years later,\u201d Ellsberg said. \u201cI said, \u2018Dick, how could you not have told me this stuff?\u2019 He said, \u2018We were embarrassed. I was embarrassed at the way we treated you.\u2019\u201d \u201cWhen he told me the story, Marcus was very angry,\u201d Ellsberg recalled. Sheehan \u201csimply lied to them as a reporter,\u201d Ellsberg said. That was \u201ctotally in line with my dealings with Sheehan.\u201d (Marcus Raskin died in 2017, Barnet died in 2004, and Stavins died earlier this year.) Former New York Times editors who were directly involved in the publication of the Pentagon Papers said in interviews that Sheehan never told them he had agreed to a deal with Raskin and IPS. In fact, they said, they didn\u2019t even know at the time that Sheehan had first obtained a portion of the Pentagon Papers from IPS, rather than from Ellsberg. \u201cSheehan never told me he got some of the documents from Raskin and IPS,\u201d said Frankel, Sheehan\u2019s boss when the outlet published the Pentagon Papers and one of the handful of senior editors directly involved in the project. \u201cI never heard of any deal that Sheehan had made with IPS and Raskin. They would have to have been very na\u00efve to believe that Sheehan could make that deal.\u201d \u201cAt the time, I was under the assumption that all 7,000 pages were all from Ellsberg,\u201d added James Greenfield, the Times\u2019s foreign news editor in 1971 and the project manager for the Pentagon Papers. The Rogovin memo doesn\u2019t provide conclusive answers about Sheehan\u2019s interactions with IPS or reveal exactly what Sheehan told his editors about IPS\u2019s role. The references to IPS in the memo are intriguing, but fragmentary. On April 2, 1971, according to the memo, Sheehan told Frankel about \u201cthe book that IPS was working on and how this could be used as a lever against the source.\u201d That suggests that Sheehan told Frankel that IPS had some of the documents and that he thought he could somehow use that knowledge to pressure Ellsberg to the Times\u2019s advantage. But it doesn\u2019t indicate that he told Frankel that he had obtained those documents from IPS. Later, during an April 21, 1971, meeting with Times editors, Sheehan mentioned \u201cthe involvement of the Institute for Policy Studies,\u201d but the memo doesn\u2019t say whether Sheehan said anything more about IPS than what he had previously told Frankel, whom the memo shows also attended the meeting. The memo\u2019s final reference to IPS indicates that at some point not long before the Pentagon Papers were published, Sheehan arranged for a Times secretary to travel from New York to Washington \u201cto deliver some materials\u201d to Sheehan\u2019s wife. Susan Sheehan then \u201cin turn, gave them to IPS,\u201d the memo states. It seems likely that after he obtained the full set of the Pentagon Papers from Ellsberg, Sheehan asked his wife to return the portion of the Pentagon Papers he had obtained from IPS. But it is not clear from the memo whether anyone else at the Times knew that\u2019s what he was doing. Susan Sheehan said in an interview that she doesn\u2019t recall the episode involving her and the delivery of materials to IPS that is described in the memo. She also said that she doesn\u2019t recall any sort of deal between her husband and the IPS researchers, adding that they all remained on good terms after the Pentagon Papers were published. Yet it is easy to see why Neil Sheehan might not have been completely forthcoming with his editors about the role of IPS. At the time, Raskin, Barnet, Stavins, and other IPS researchers were considered wild-eyed leftist activists by the Washington establishment, and Times management might have been concerned if they had known that some of the documents were coming from the group. \u201cThey did not want to be associated with IPS,\u201d Ellsberg said. In early 1971, Raskin, Barnet, and Stavins met with Ellsberg and urged him to meet with Sheehan. Ellsberg, frustrated by the failure of his other plans for making the documents public, agreed. By the time they began to discuss the Pentagon Papers, Ellsberg and Sheehan had known each other for several years. Ellsberg said in an interview that he had secretly leaked some information to Sheehan for a story about Vietnam in 1968; they met again two years later at a dinner party hosted by Tony Lake, a former aide to Richard Nixon\u2019s national security adviser, Henry Kissinger. Lake had recently resigned from Kissinger\u2019s staff in response to the June 1970 invasion of Cambodia. (Lake later served as national security adviser for President Bill Clinton.) At the time of the dinner in the fall of 1970, Sheehan was working as a reporter in the Washington bureau of the Times. He had spent years in Vietnam covering the war, first for UPI and later for the Times, and had gained a stellar reputation; along with Times reporter David Halberstam, Sheehan had been among the first American reporters to write skeptical stories about the war. But at the dinner, Sheehan seemed adrift. He told Ellsberg he was frustrated with the Times, complaining that he couldn\u2019t get the newspaper\u2019s editors interested in the stories he wanted to write about the ongoing war, Ellsberg recalled. Sheehan told Ellsberg that the paper \u201cis done with Vietnam.\u201d Ellsberg did not mention the Pentagon Papers to Sheehan at the dinner; instead, he came away from their conversation convinced that the Times would not be interested in them. Sheehan \u201csays, \u2018They won\u2019t let me cover Vietnam. They\u2019ve got me covering other domestic stuff. They\u2019re just not interested.\u2019 And so I had the feeling from that, well, no use giving them top-secret stuff,\u201d Ellsberg said in an interview. So when Raskin and the other IPS researchers later recommended that Ellsberg meet with Sheehan \u2014 still not revealing that they had already given the reporter a portion of the documents \u2014 Ellsberg was skeptical. \u201cI had lunch or dinner with Stavins and Raskin and Barnet, and they say I should put this out in the New York Times,\u201d Ellsberg recalled. \u201cAnd they say, \u2018Do you know Neil Sheehan?\u2019 I say, \u2018Yes,\u2019 but that I had gotten the impression from him that [the Times] are not \u2026 promising. And they say, \u2018We think you ought to try him again.\u2019\u201d \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have done it if they hadn\u2019t suggested it.\u201d Early in 1971, Ellsberg came to Washington for dinner with some friends. He was planning to stay with his friend John Paul Vann, whom he knew from Vietnam, where Vann had served as a senior civilian adviser. But Ellsberg couldn\u2019t find Vann that night, so he called Sheehan to see if he could spend the night at his house. (Sheehan later wrote a Pulitzer Prize-winning book, \u201cA Bright Shining Lie,\u201d about Vann and his role in Vietnam.) Sheehan set up a cot for Ellsberg in his basement, and they stayed up all night talking about Vietnam. Sheehan showed Ellsberg the galleys of a review he had written for the Times of books about American war crimes there. \u201cHe said, \u2018I\u2019m having a lot of trouble with the editors on this,\u2019\u201d Ellsberg recalled. \u201cI read it in his D.C. basement. Very good! This is very good stuff. So I thought, \u2018OK, he\u2019s the guy.\u2019\u201d So that night, Ellsberg began to tell Sheehan about the Pentagon Papers. \u201cAnd I mention to him that Dick Barnet and Marcus Raskin had suggested [that I talk to him], and I told him that I had given [the documents] to IPS. He said, \u2018I had some inkling that IPS had some of this material, I have heard of it before.\u2019 He didn\u2019t admit at all that they had given [him] any\u201d of the documents. Ellsberg offered to show Sheehan the Pentagon Papers, and Sheehan agreed to come to Cambridge, Massachusetts, where Ellsberg was then living, to read them. \u201cHe could have told me, \u2018I\u2019ve got some of this already, and we\u2019re going with it,\u2019\u201d Ellsberg said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t tell me. He didn\u2019t say he had it, or that they were going full speed with the 1,000 pages.\u201d \u201cAround March 3, 1971,\u201d Sheehan first told his editors at the Times about the possibility of \u201cpublishing the D.O.D.\u2019s history of U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War,\u201d the Rogovin memo states. A few days later, the memo adds, James Reston, the legendary Times Washington columnist and editor, \u201cwalked up to Neil as he was entering the elevator and told him \u2018You have clearance, young man.\u2019\u201d On March 13, at the Gridiron Club dinner, an annual gathering of politicians and journalists in Washington, Frankel \u201ccalled Jim Goodale aside and told him to read the law on classified documents because they might have a story involving a lot of classified documents,\u201d the memo states. About two weeks after their all-night talk in Washington, Sheehan went to Cambridge to read through the full set of the Pentagon Papers. But Ellsberg imposed some conditions on the reporter. He told Sheehan that he didn\u2019t want him to just write a quick daily story based on the documents, but instead wanted the Times to do a big, deep dive into the secret history. \u201cI don\u2019t want it to be a one-day story,\u201d Ellsberg recalled telling Sheehan. He said he wanted the Times to \u201cgive a lot of space to it.\u201d Ellsberg said in an interview that he didn\u2019t want to go to prison for a news story that came and went without much impact. Frankel told Sheehan that the Times would probably go along with that demand, according to the Rogovin memo. \u201cWe might well take it under the conditions your source wants, i.e. using it all or very large chunks. We\u2019re very interested,\u201d Frankel said, according to the memo. But Ellsberg\u2019s other big condition was more difficult. He told Sheehan that he could read the documents \u2014 but not make copies. \u201cYou can read as much as you want, you can take notes as much as you need, but I\u2019m asking you not to copy them until we have an agreement, an interest at the Times\u201d in publishing stories about them, Ellsberg recalled telling Sheehan. \u201cBecause I had gotten the impression from Neil earlier that they were very unlikely to print this top-secret stuff.\u201d By that time, Ellsberg had discovered to his horror that IPS had copies of the Pentagon Papers openly lying around \u201call over the place\u201d in its Washington office. He feared that if he let Sheehan copy the documents before the Times had agreed to publish stories about them, they might wind up lying around openly at the newspaper as well, and that someone might discover them there and call the FBI. So Ellsberg wanted an assurance from Sheehan that the Times was serious about publishing before he agreed to let him copy the documents. Sheehan wouldn\u2019t give him that assurance and in fact, misled him into thinking that the Times was still on the fence. \u201cI said, \u2018I don\u2019t want this stuff sitting around the Times indefinitely,\u2019\u201d Ellsberg said he told Sheehan. \u201c\u2018If they are really interested and think they would like to use them, you got it, you got the whole thing.\u2019 He wouldn\u2019t tell me that. He never did. He could have said, \u2018Yes, they intend to do it.\u2019 They were already working on it. He didn\u2019t tell me that. He lied.\u201d When Sheehan arrived in Cambridge, Ellsberg and his wife, Patricia, were frazzled and burned out by an unexpected development. While they had waited for Sheehan to arrive, Ellsberg had met with Tom Oliphant, a reporter for the Boston Globe, and mentioned the Pentagon Papers. Oliphant quickly wrote a story in the Globe about the secret history, which thus became the first news story disclosing the documents\u2019 existence. When he read the Globe story, Ellsberg panicked. Even though he had not leaked the papers to the Globe, he feared that the story might convince the government that he was about to leak them to the press. In an interview, Oliphant said that Ellsberg\u2019s recollection about his story for the Globe was accurate, adding that the response he got to his story suggests that Ellsberg was right to worry about the government. \u201cThe day after my story ran, I was contacted by Kissinger\u2019s office,\u201d Oliphant recalled. \u201cThey wanted multiple copies of it.\u201d Ellsberg and his wife worked around the clock to make as many copies of the documents as they could. \u201cPatricia and I started making more copies, literally without sleep. \u2026 We start putting them in more places around Harvard Square\u201d in the apartments of people Ellsberg trusted. \u201cFor five or six days, we had hardly any sleep, waiting for the FBI,\u201d he recalled. When Sheehan arrived, Ellsberg was jittery and off-kilter. \u201cLooking back, I knew he regarded me somehow as kind of wild,\u201d Ellsberg said. \u201cPatricia and I hadn\u2019t slept for a week, and we were both on caffeine.\u201d What\u2019s more, when Ellsberg showed Sheehan the Globe story, \u201che seemed scared.\u201d With Ellsberg talking openly about the Pentagon Papers to another reporter, Sheehan may have feared that his source was out of control. Ellsberg then made a puzzling decision. He went on vacation and left Sheehan with a key to the apartment in Cambridge where the Pentagon Papers were stored, telling Sheehan he could continue reading them while Ellsberg was gone. \u201cI gave the key to Neil and said, \u2018Neil, I\u2019m counting on you not to copy this. Just, you know, you can make notes, but no Xerox.\u2019 And he says, \u2018Absolutely, absolutely, no problem.\u2019\u201d On their vacation, Ellsberg recalled, his wife told him: \u201cHe\u2019ll copy it.\u201d \u201cAnd I said, \u2018I don\u2019t think so, he promised me he wouldn\u2019t.\u2019\u201d But that is exactly what Sheehan did. \u201cOn March 20 or 21st, Neil called [Times editor] Bill Kovacs and asked him to obtain a Xeroxer for him,\u201d under an assumed name and to \u201cget money from New York to pay for reproduction,\u201d the Rogovin memo states. \u201cThe following day, when Kovacs brought [$400] to Neil, he was told in very general terms why Neil was in Boston.\u201d On the night of March 23, Sheehan made his call to Frankel to tell him he \u201cgot it all,\u201d according to the Rogovin memo. The next day, Sheehan met with his editors in Washington and \u201ctold them what he had and why he had handled it the way he did. Neil stressed his obligation to protect his source.\u201d Frankel asked Sheehan to write a memo \u201con what the materials contained and how the stories might be written.\u201d Sheehan gave him the memo on March 28, which Frankel delivered to the newspaper\u2019s top brass. Frankel told Sheehan that \u201cNew York was excited.\u201d Weeks before the Times published the Pentagon Papers, Sheehan called Ellsberg and told him that the Times had still not decided whether it was interested in the documents. \u201cHe phoned me from New York,\u201d Ellsberg recalled. \u201cHe said, \u2018They have not made a decision, they are waffling on this.\u2019 False.\u201d Ellsberg recalled that Sheehan then told him that \u201c\u2018they have me working on other things, but I want to be ready to use it if they ever do make a decision on this, so I want to continue to read it, so I need a copy for that.\u2019\u201d That was when Ellsberg finally agreed to let Sheehan copy the Pentagon Papers, telling him to go to Patricia\u2019s New York apartment, where he had stored a copy. Ellsberg said he would arrange for the doorman at the apartment building to let Sheehan in. \u201cI said, \u2018All right, you can have a copy.\u2019 I said to him, \u2018When I give you a copy, I understand it is out of my hands. I know I don\u2019t have any control over it.\u2019\u201d Ellsberg recalled that the phone conversation was in April 1971, but Rogovin\u2019s memo states that \u201con May 27th Neil\u2019s source gave him \u2018official permission\u2019 to possess the papers.\u201d (While the memo never mentions Ellsberg by name in order to protect his identity, it is clear that whenever Sheehan talks about the \u201csource,\u201d he is referring to Ellsberg. In the memo, Sheehan described the \u201csource\u201d as someone who had \u201cseen a number of senators in an effort to have them publicly reveal the content of the papers but to date had been unsuccessful.\u201d) When Ellsberg gave Sheehan permission to copy the documents, Ellsberg still didn\u2019t know that Sheehan had long since done so, or that Sheehan and other reporters and editors were holed up at a New York hotel writing stories about them. Based on what Sheehan told him, Ellsberg still believed that the Times wasn\u2019t interested in the documents, so he kept searching for other ways to make them public, even after he told Sheehan to go to Patricia\u2019s apartment to pick up a set of the papers. Why did Sheehan take the risk that Ellsberg would find another outlet for the documents, Ellsberg wondered, decades later. \u201cIf he\u2019d said, \u2018Dan, I have to tell you, I have a copy of it,\u2019 I would have said, \u2018You know, OK, fine,\u2019\u201d Ellsberg said, just so long as the Times was committed to writing about the secret history. In fact, the Rogovin memo shows that the Times was worried that Ellsberg was still distributing the documents to other people, and that other news organizations might soon get them. As it scrambled to publish its stories, the Times discovered that Ellsberg had given some documents to Rep. Pete McCloskey, a liberal, anti-war Republican from California, and Times editors feared that McCloskey would give the documents to the Los Angeles Times, according to the Rogovin memo. To determine McCloskey\u2019s plans, Bob Phelps, an editor in the New York Times\u2019s Washington bureau, met with the politician, who promised that \u201che would not turn over what he had to another paper,\u201d the memo states. While Sheehan tried to keep Ellsberg at bay and the Times prepared to publish the documents, the newspaper was grappling with other problems. The Times editors felt they had to be careful in choosing which reporters to bring onto the project to work with Sheehan, according to the Rogovin memo. \u201cThe people selected were picked for competence and loyalty,\u201d the memo states. \u201cOne reporter was rejected because his wife was a \u2018peacenik,\u2019 he wasn\u2019t considered discreet and she might talk.\u201d The reporters and editors worked in secret in the New York Hilton, which was chosen after the editors rejected proposals to move the operation to either Tarrytown, New York, or Charlottesville, Virginia, according to the memo. By late April, they had two copies of the Pentagon Papers at the hotel, where the Times had also moved typewriters, filing cabinets, a safe, and other supplies. A third copy of the papers was stored at Greenfield\u2019s apartment after Goodale insisted that none of the copies be kept inside the Times building, according to the memo. \u201cDuring the next month work began, additional people joined the Hilton group and the pressure to meet deadlines started to build,\u201d the Rogovin memo says. But even as the Times built a large Pentagon Papers team, Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, the Times publisher known by his nickname, Punch, still hadn\u2019t given his final approval to publish. He was under pressure from some Times executives, as well as the paper\u2019s outside law firm, which strongly urged against any publication at all, even of stories about the documents, according to Goodale, Greenfield, and Frankel. (The outside firm, Lord Day & Lord, dropped the Times as a client right after the publication of the Pentagon Papers.) Sulzberger was especially hesitant about publishing the actual documents. \u201cHe tried to split the baby in half, and only publish stories without publishing the documents,\u201d recalled Frankel in an interview. \u201cWe said that you have to publish the documents to provide strong evidence of what the Pentagon was thinking. He finally agreed, after I made it clear to him that there were no real secrets in these papers. They were policy studies, not military secrets.\u201d Punch Sulzberger died in 2012. His son, Arthur Sulzberger Jr., who succeeded him and served as publisher until 2018, declined to comment for this story. In the end, Punch Sulzberger agreed with his editors. The Rogovin memo states that \u201cby June 6 Neil finished his second piece [in the Pentagon Papers series] \u2026 around that time Greenfield came over to report on the publisher\u2019s decision regarding publication.\u201d On Saturday, June 12, 1971, Ellsberg got a call from Tony Austin, who worked on the New York Times Magazine. Ellsberg had given Austin the volume of the Pentagon Papers that dealt with the Gulf of Tonkin incident for a book Austin was writing. In August 1964, when U.S. Navy ships ventured into North Vietnamese territorial waters in the Gulf of Tonkin, President Lyndon Johnson and the Pentagon lied about the North Vietnamese response, falsely claiming the North Vietnamese had assaulted the ships. Johnson then used the trumped-up incident to win congressional passage of what became known as the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, which became Johnson\u2019s justification to dramatically escalate the war by sending in conventional combat forces. \u201cSo on Saturday, June 12, I get a call from Tony Austin, and he\u2019s almost in tears,\u201d recalled Ellsberg. \u201cHe says, \u2018Dan, my book is ruined. You know that study you gave me? They have the whole study, and they are going to publish starting tonight. They are totally going to scoop my book.\u2019\u201d \u201cI asked him how he knew what the Times was planning. He says, \u2018The place is locked down.\u2019\u201d Ellsberg had not heard anything from Sheehan. He tried to call but couldn\u2019t reach him. Sheehan later confessed that he was avoiding Ellsberg. But Ellsberg did reach Greenfield that day. \u201cHe got me on the phone, and he expressed some doubts about what was happening,\u201d Greenfield recalled. \u201cHe seemed rattled.\u201d \u201cI said, \u2018It\u2019s too late now. It\u2019s all in print.\u2019\u201d \u201cAt 6 p.m. June 12th, the presses began rolling,\u201d the Rogovin memo states. That night in Cambridge, Ellsberg, his wife, and some friends smoked marijuana and went to see the movie \u201cButch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.\u201d \u201cWe got stoned out of our minds to see \u2018Butch Cassidy\u2019 for about the fourth time, and it was most enjoyable,\u201d Ellsberg recalled. After the movie, he went to the kiosk in Harvard Square where the early editions of the next morning\u2019s New York Times were on sale. \u201cOf course, I\u2019m furious at Neil for not telling me. But when I go and there is the paper at midnight, wow, great, all is forgiven, you know, no problem.\u201d Months later, Ellsberg ran into Sheehan walking on Fifth Avenue in New York. It was the first time they had spoken since the Pentagon Papers had been published. \u201cSo we go into a doorway, and I grill him a little bit,\u201d Ellsberg said. \u201cAnd he said, \u2018Dan, it was bigger than both of us, you know, I had to do what I had to do,\u2019\u201d Ellsberg recalled. \u201cSo, OK.\u201d After Neil Sheehan died in 2021, the Times published an interview he had done with the paper six years earlier on the condition that it not be released until after his death. In it, Sheehan acknowledged that he had kept Ellsberg at arm\u2019s length because he didn\u2019t think he could trust him with the knowledge that the Times was going ahead with the publication of the Pentagon Papers. Sheehan knew that Ellsberg had already talked to a wide range of people both in Congress and elsewhere about the documents, and that it was only a matter of time before the Nixon administration discovered what Ellsberg was doing. That would lead the government to the Times. \u201cThere\u2019s no way The Times can protect this guy,\u201d Sheehan in the interview. Ellsberg had \u201cleft tracks on the ceiling, on the walls, everywhere \u2026 sooner or later, I was afraid he was going to run into a politician who\u2019d go right to the Justice Department.\u201d The relationship between Ellsberg and the Times following the publication of the Pentagon Papers was equally messy. In particular, Ellsberg complained that the Times was sloppy in its efforts to protect him as a source. Soon after the newspaper began publishing the Pentagon Papers, Sidney Zion, a freelance writer who had previously worked for the Times, went on a New York radio show and revealed that Ellsberg was the source of the documents. \u201cThe only person I had dealt with was Neil Sheehan, and no one else at the paper was supposed to know,\u201d Ellsberg said \u2014 a statement at odds with Greenfield\u2019s recollection that Ellsberg called him the day before the documents were published. Zion, who died in 2009, that Ellsberg\u2019s identity was common knowledge in New York media circles. More recently, Ellsberg was angered by the 2021 Times story based on the interview with Sheehan. He especially took issue with Sheehan\u2019s claim that \u201ccontrary to what is generally believed, Mr. Ellsberg never \u2018gave\u2019 the papers to The Times. \u2026 Mr. Ellsberg told Mr. Sheehan that he could read them but not make copies.\u201d The Rogovin memo shows that account to be inaccurate, since the memo says that Ellsberg ultimately gave Sheehan \u201cpermission to possess the papers.\u201d \u201cNever gave it to them?\u201d Ellsberg said in an interview. \u201cThat\u2019s crazy.\u201d Nixon initially didn\u2019t plan to take any action to stop the publication of the Pentagon Papers once it had begun because the secret history was primarily about Vietnam policy during the Kennedy and Johnson administrations, rather than his own. But Kissinger convinced Nixon that the leak represented a major national security breach and that the president couldn\u2019t ignore it. So Nixon ordered the Justice Department to seek a court-ordered injunction against further publication by the Times. On June 14, 1971, the day after the Times began publishing the papers, Nixon\u2019s Attorney General John Mitchell warned the newspaper to halt further publication of the documents. The Times refused, and the government obtained an injunction. Ellsberg went into hiding, while a small team of his supporters, led by historian Gar Alperovitz, to covertly get copies of the Pentagon Papers to the Washington Post, which was then hit with an injunction as well. Ellsberg then directed the team to get more documents to an expanding list of other newspapers to try to continue their publication. In the process, they were creating their own version of the internet, trying to make the documents so widely available that the court injunctions would be moot. On June 28, Ellsberg turned himself in to face charges in connection with the leak, making him the public face of the Pentagon Papers. He was mobbed by reporters in Boston and suddenly became one of the most famous people in America. Two days later, the Supreme Court, in a landmark decision, lifted the government\u2019s injunction against further publication by the Times and the Post. For Nixon, the aftereffects of the Pentagon Papers case continued to reverberate. The president became obsessed with leaks and created the infamous White House Plumbers to go after them. In September 1971, the Plumbers broke into the office of Ellsberg\u2019s psychiatrist in Los Angeles to search for material they could use to smear him. The burglary was a precursor to the Watergate break-in a year later, which was also conducted by the White House Plumbers and which led to Nixon\u2019s downfall. In May 1973, the judge in Ellsberg\u2019s trial in Los Angeles dismissed the government\u2019s case against him after the Justice Department turned over a memo written by the Watergate special prosecutor disclosing the burglary of Ellsberg\u2019s psychiatrist\u2019s office. (Ironically, Ellsberg learned some of the details of Sheehan\u2019s betrayal during his trial, when Ellsberg\u2019s lawyers obtained notes written by White House Plumber E. Howard Hunt showing that Sheehan and his wife had checked into Cambridge hotels under assumed names and taken the Pentagon Papers to copy shops in Boston and Medford, Massachusetts. The White House Plumbers clearly knew more about what Sheehan was doing than did Ellsberg, who later wrote about Hunt\u2019s notes in his 2002 memoir, \u201cSecrets.\u201d) The Nixon administration\u2019s obsession with Ellsberg \u2014 whom Kissinger called \u201cthe most dangerous man in America\u201d \u2014 turned Ellsberg into an international icon. His fame lasted the rest of his life, long after the secrets revealed in the Pentagon Papers had faded from memory. Ellsberg waited many years to talk publicly about his relationship with the Times, and even then, he only rarely expressed bitterness toward Sheehan and the newspaper. After all, the Times had ultimately published the Pentagon Papers, which is what Ellsberg wanted. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to make the Times my enemy,\u201d he said. In fact, he said that after the Pentagon Papers, he eventually reconciled with Sheehan and agreed to be interviewed for his book, \u201cA Bright Shining Lie.\u201d Susan Sheehan said in an interview that over the years after the Pentagon Papers were published, she and her husband developed a good relationship with Ellsberg and his wife. The Times won the Pulitzer Prize for public service for publishing the Pentagon Papers, but the paper still quietly resented the fact that Ellsberg had garnered so much attention for his role in making the secret history public. Ellsberg said that a Times reporter once told him told him that Abe Rosenthal, the newspaper\u2019s managing editor when the Pentagon Papers were published and later its executive editor, hated Ellsberg. (Rosenthal died in 2006.) \u201cWhy would he hate me?\u201d Ellsberg asked. \u201cBecause you took the story away from the Times,\u201d the reporter replied. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just the Times, it was Ellsberg.\u201d Deconstructed Podcast Deconstructed Vincent Bevins discusses his new book, \u201cIf We Burn: The Mass Protest Decade and the Missing Revolution,\u201d and the global protest movements of the 2010s.

    "content": "A s a candidate in the 2020 election, Joe Biden assailed Donald Trump over what he cast as his rival\u2019s ineffective and un-American approach to immigration \u2013 one that undermined the nation\u2019s long history of welcoming those seeking refuge in the United States. Now as president, facing a migrant crisis that is straining resources at the border and feeding into major US cities, Biden has taken a series of steps that critics on his left say are hardly distinguishable from his predecessor. AOC slams sanctions against Venezuela and deportation flights Read more This week, the Biden administration announced that it will waive a series of federal laws to expedite construction of new barriers along the southern border with Mexico and, separately, resume deportation flights to Venezuela . The actions represent a striking reversal for a president who stopped construction of the border wall on the first day of his administration, after promising on the campaign trail that there would \u201cnot be another foot\u201d built on his watch. Biden insisted on Thursday that the move did not reflect a change of position and were simply appropriated funds being spent as they were allocated. Yet they underscore the complex political landscape the president faces in confronting this crisis ahead of next year\u2019s presidential election, with humanitarian disasters across the globe driving more people to the US\u2019s borders. As Biden\u2019s challenges at the border deepen, Republicans are intensifying their efforts to put immigration at the center of the political debate in 2024. Republicans believe immigration and border security are among the president\u2019s biggest political vulnerabilities. According to the latest NBC News poll , voters also give Republicans the overwhelming advantage on the question of which party is better equipped to handle immigration, a margin that has doubled since Biden\u2019s first year in office. But the issue has also created a wedge between the administration and some of Biden\u2019s staunchest allies. Democratic leaders in New York, Illinois and elsewhere have publicly expressed their dissatisfaction with the administration\u2019s handling of the situation, bluntly accusing the federal government of doing too little to address the increase of migrants in their states. \u201cThere is much more that can and must be done on a federal level to address a national humanitarian crisis that is currently being shouldered by state and local governments without support,\u201d the Illinois governor JB Pritzker wrote in an open letter to the president. Pritzker declared the situation in his state \u201cuntenable\u201d as officials strain to house and feed the influx of migrants. New York City mayor Eric Adams, in an interview with Semafor this week, said the White House was \u201cwrong on immigration,\u201d continuing his sharp public criticism of the federal response. Blue-state leaders had also urged the administration to expand protections for Venezuelans, arguing that it would ease the burden on shelters by making it easier for them to live and work in the US. And, as part of his response, last month the Biden administration announced it would extend temporary protected status (TPS) to nearly a half-million Venezuelans currently in the US. The surge of migrants has been fueled in part by Venezuelans fleeing political upheaval and economic hardship. In September, a monthly record 50,000 Venezuelans crossed the US southern border. The move was roundly welcomed by blue-state leaders and immigration advocates, who had been pushing the administration to extend protections to Venezuelans for more than a year. But when the Biden administration announced on Thursday it would resume deportations of Venezuelans who enter the US unlawfully, advocates were outraged. \u201cThis decision further exposes troubling policy inconsistencies from the administration,\u201d Krish O\u2019Mara Vignarajah, president of Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service, said in a statement . She added: \u201cWhile the challenge of managing migration is very complex, this administration continues to lean too heavily on the stick over the carrot.\u201d Immigration and border security have bedeviled the past several administrations. Efforts to reform the nation\u2019s outdated immigration system have repeatedly faltered in a divided Congress, even as both sides claim it as a priority. Instead, pressure has grown on the executive branch to act unilaterally. Biden insists he has tried. On the day he took office, he proposed legislation that would provide a path to citizenship for an estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants and expand visa eligibility for workers and families. But it has gone nowhere in the face of Republican opposition. Meanwhile, conservative judges, taking up challenges brought by Republicans officials, have thwarted a number of the administration\u2019s immigration efforts. On Thursday, Biden defended the decision by his administration to build additional barriers along the border with Mexico, doubling down on the idea that he had no choice but to allow construction after Congress appropriated the funds in 2019, when Trump was president. Yet by waiving 26 federal laws to allow construction along sections of the border wall in south Texas, critics say he helped to expedite a project at the heart of his predecessor\u2019s immigration legacy. Asked by a reporter whether he had changed his mind that border walls work, Biden said on Thursday that he had not. Conservatives were quick to mock the president for building a wall he didn\u2019t believe would be effective, while immigration advocates decried the president\u2019s actions as an attempt to insulate him from political attacks. In a statement, Jonathan Blazer, director of border strategies at the American Civil Liberties Union, called Biden\u2019s decision to extend the border wall a \u201cprofound failure\u201d. \u201cThis politically motivated action will only harm border communities,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s time for the Biden administration to choose humanity and real solutions over politics.\u201d",

    "content": "\u201cD emocrats in disarray\u201d has been an oft-repeated joke in Washington in recent years, a tongue-in-cheek reference to the tensions that repeatedly flared up between the progressives and the centrists of Joe Biden\u2019s party. But on Tuesday, House Democrats presented a united front as their Republican counterparts turned against each other and ultimately ousted one of their own in a historic defeat. The entire House Democratic caucus voted unanimously to remove the Republican Kevin McCarthy as speaker on Tuesday, joining eight mostly hard-right lawmakers in supporting a motion to vacate the chair. Refusing to intervene in a mess of Republicans\u2019 own making, Democrats looked on as McCarthy was unseated, making him the first House speaker in US history to be removed from office. Under the oversight of their new leader, Hakeem Jeffries of New York, House Democrats have marched in lockstep to challenge Republicans\u2019 policy agenda, offering a stark contrast to the fractious conference that McCarthy tried and failed to unify. As they look to take back the House next year, Democrats hope to use the instability displayed this week to make a broader argument about the extremism that they say has come to define the modern Republican party. Heading into the Tuesday vote, speculation abounded over whether McCarthy might offer Democrats some kind of deal to help save his speakership. But McCarthy chose not to, telling CNBC on Tuesday: \u201cThey haven\u2019t asked for anything, and I\u2019m not going to provide anything.\u201d Instead, McCarthy tried to appeal to members\u2019 faith in the integrity of the House to keep his gavel, arguing that a removal of a speaker would represent an irreversible black mark on the institution. Kevin McCarthy was voted out of his job as speaker on Tuesday. Photograph: J Scott Applewhite/AP But that argument struck many Democrats as hypocritical coming from McCarthy, particularly given the speaker\u2019s stunning flip-flop regarding the deadly insurrection at the Capitol on 6 January 2021. In the days after the attack, McCarthy said Donald Trump \u201cbears responsibility\u201d for the violence carried out by a group of the former president\u2019s supporters. But just two weeks later, McCarthy flew to Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida to make amends, and he later denounced the work of the House select committee investigating the insurrection. McCarthy \u201cwent to Mar-a-Lago to kiss the ring and voted not to impeach Donald Trump for inciting a violent insurrection against the 2020 presidential election and our government\u201d, Jamie Raskin, a Democratic member of the select committee, said Tuesday. \u201cThis is a somber day for America as the chickens come home to roost for Kevin McCarthy.\u201d The final self-inflicted nail in McCarthy\u2019s coffin came on Sunday, the day after the House passed a continuing resolution to extend government funding through 17 November and avert a federal shutdown. House Democrats overwhelmingly supported the stopgap funding bill, with just one member voting against it, but 90 House Republicans opposed the legislation. Donald Trump backs hard-right loyalist Jim Jordan for House speaker Read more And yet, when McCarthy appeared on CBS News\u2019 Face the Nation on Sunday, he attempted to blame Democrats for the last-minute scramble. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure it was going to pass. You want to know why? Because the Democrats tried to do everything they can not to let it pass,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cThey did not want the bill. They were willing to let government shut down, for our military not to be paid.\u201d House Democratic leaders played a clip of McCarthy\u2019s interview during their Tuesday morning caucus meeting, just hours before the chamber\u2019s vote on removing the speaker. McCarthy\u2019s comments outraged Democrats, fortifying the caucus\u2019s resolve to support the motion to vacate. \u201cIt goes in political 101 textbooks going forward as maybe one of the most \u2026 stupid things somebody could do on the eve of your survival vote,\u201d Gerry Connolly, a Democratic Virginia congressman, told NBC News . In the end, every present House Democrat voted to oust McCarthy, ensuring the end of his speakership. Democrats commended Jeffries on keeping his members unified on Tuesday, mirroring the caucus\u2019s unanimous support for Jeffries through 15 rounds of voting during the speakership election in January. \u201cYesterday was a pure demonstration of the type of leadership and continuity that [Jeffries] brings to the table and how inclusive he is,\u201d said Antjuan Seawright, a Democratic strategist. \u201cHe has, I think, been extra intentional about keeping all four corners of the House Democratic caucus square together and living out what diversity and inclusion means when it comes to House Democrats.\u201d Jeffries has now called on more centrist members of the House Republican conference to join Democrats in forming a \u201cbipartisan governing coalition\u201d. The Democratic representative Dean Phillips leaves the Capitol on 29 September. Photograph: Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images \u201cAt this point, we simply need Republican partners willing to break with Maga extremism, reform the highly partisan House rules that were adopted at the beginning of this Congress and join us in finding common ground for the people,\u201d he wrote in a Washington Post op-ed published on Friday. So far, Republican partners have been difficult to find. Some of McCarthy\u2019s allies blamed House Democrats for the speaker\u2019s removal, accusing them of prioritizing their political goals over the good of the country. Democrats have scoffed at that argument, asserting that McCarthy brought about his own downfall by trying to appease the hard-right members who ultimately ousted him. McCarthy only won the speakership in January by making concessions to hard-right lawmakers, including a rule allowing any single member to introduce a motion to vacate the chair. That decision came back to haunt McCarthy this week. \u201cThe same rightwing extremism that gave McCarthy the speakership was the same rightwing extremism that took away his speakership,\u201d Seawright said. \u201cHouse Democrats should continue to draw the contrast with extremism that has hijacked and pretty much taken over the Republican conference with the comparison and the contrast of what was able to be done\u201d when the Democrats had the House majority. Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, suggested the speakership debacle could be a launchpad for Democrats to engage in a fuller discussion about rightwing extremism. With government funding due to run out in just a month, Green said it was urgent for Democrats to make a policy-based pitch against Republicans\u2019 legislative agenda. \u201cExtremism doesn\u2019t just mean they can\u2019t rally their caucus on the House floor. Extremism means they would actually cut social security benefits for millions of current and future seniors,\u201d Green said. \u201cThe extremists within an already extreme Republican party that are in charge are the same ones who would be most likely to use their leverage to cut programs like social security.\u201d As the House prepares for another speakership election, much of the conversation in Washington has focused on who might replace McCarthy. But for Green, the more important conversation involves how the new Republican speaker will govern with a newly emboldened hard-right faction in his conference. Steve Scalise and Jim Jordan, two speaker candidates, have also backed drastic government funding cuts, voting in favor of McCarthy\u2019s recent failed proposal to temporarily reduce most government agencies\u2019 budgets by up to 30%. \u201cI think it\u2019s important to connect the dots between the chaos and extremism we\u2019ve seen playing out in this leadership fight and what those same forces will attempt to do in the upcoming government funding fight,\u201d Green said. \u201cIt\u2019s very possible that members of the public perceive these as two very different stories, as opposed to two chapters in the same story.\u201d",

    "description": "Spain, Portugal and Morocco will host the 2030 World Cup, and talks are ongoing over where the final of the tournament will be held, with Madrid and Casablanca competing.",
    "content": "Forbes Business SportsMoney The Battle To Host The 2030 World Cup Final Heats Up Sam Leveridge Contributor Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own. I am a sports journalist interested in soccer living in Spain. Following Oct 7, 2023, 06:30am EDT | Press play to listen to this article! Got it! Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin The Estadio Santiago Bernab\u00e9u is one of the leading candidates to host the final. Europa Press via Getty Images Following the news that Spain, Portugal and Morocco will be the only bid to host the 2030 World Cup, attentions have turned to who will host the major event in the form of the tournament\u2019s final. There was also the unexpected news that three of the opening games will be played in South America, across Uruguay, Argentina and Paraguay, to honor the tournament\u2019s centenary year. While FIFA have clarified that the opening match will be played in one of the three host countries, it has also sparked a battle between the three to hold the final. Talks are expected to follow later in October, with Moroccan officials confirming a meeter will take place to discuss scheduling on October 18, which could include discussions regarding the host for the final. The host city for the 2026 World Cup final, hosted across the United States, Canada and Mexico, is also yet to be confirmed, and the 2030 tournament poses similar questions with the competition again split across three nations. Morocco have the chance to host a second World Cup final in Africa, while Spain or Portugal could become the first European nation to host the occasion since the Olympiastadion in Berlin, Germany, in 2006.

WWE SmackDown Results: Winners And Grades On October 6, 2023 23andMe User Data Stolen And Listed For Sale In Attack Targeting Ashkenazi Jews Estadio Santiago Bernab\u00e9u, Madrid, Spain One of the leading candidates is the jewel in Spanish soccer\u2019s crown, the Estadio Santiago Bernab\u00e9u. Currently undergoing an expansion and modernization project which will take its capacity to over 82,000, the Bernab\u00e9u will likely be the only stadium in the 2030 World Cup with a roof and will also benefit from some of the best corporate hospitality options in the game. The project, led by Real Madrid\u2019s president Florentino P\u00e9rez, has cost an estimated \u20ac893 million ($947 million), and the World Cup final would be seen as the perfect way to celebrate. Building work remains ongoing at present, but is expected to be completed in 2024, with many of the new features already being used this season. In the centre of the Spanish capital of Madrid, the Bernab\u00e9u is not only respected for its history, including hosting the 1982 World Cup final, but also for its state of the art facilities and transport links. The Metro system serves the stadium with its own station, while local and national train links stop nearby and the Adolfo Su\u00e1rez Madrid-Barajas Airport is only a short journey away. That\u2019s in addition to Madrid being one of Europe\u2019s leading hospitality capitals, with experience in hosting major events, including the Champions League final in 2019 and a Copa Libertadores final the same year. Giving his take on the matter, Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti made his stance clear, saying, \u201cthe World Cup final has to be in Madrid, because it\u2019s the capital of Spain, and in the Bernab\u00e9u because it will be the best stadium in the world.\u201d Gran Stade de Casablanca, Morocco The other leading candidate is one which doesn\u2019t yet exist. The proposed Gran State de Casablanca will be purpose built to celebrate the 2030 World Cup with an expected capacity of 93,000, making it one of the tournament\u2019s largest stadiums. The stadium formed part of Morocco\u2019s 2010 World Cup bid and has remained on the table ever since, with the project now expected to be completed and opened in 2025 in time for the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations, which will be hosted by Morocco. The building project is expected to cost around $200 million. Gran Stade de Casablanca is the only one of Morocco\u2019s six arenas put forward for the tournament which is yet to be built, but remains a leading candidate. Casablanca currently hosts the 46,000 capacity Stade Mohammed V, which is home to Raja Casablanca and Wydad Casablanca, two of the biggest teams in Morocco. \"We look forward to an extraordinary final that will honour the whole continent and the younger generation in a stadium in Casablanca that will be extraordinary and wonderful,\u201d Faouzi Lekjaa, president of the Moroccan Football Federation, said, as he continued to push for the African city to host the spectacle. Other options Beyond these two, there is, of course, the possibility of holding the climax tournament in the other host country, Portugal. Portuguese officials have been quiet to date in terms of the final, but their stadiums have frequently been chosen as one of the preferred destinations for major finals of UEFA EFA . In 2020, Lisbon and the Est\u00e1dio da Luz hosted the Champions League final, while a year later it traveled a few hours nothing to the Est\u00e1dio do Drag\u00e3o in Porto. Their capacities, of 66,000 and 50,000 respectively, make them smaller options than their rivals in Spain and Morocco, and may give the other nations an advantage. Even within Spain, there could be competition. While the Bernab\u00e9u is seen as the favourite given its ongoing building work at present and its presence in the capital, the Spotify Camp Nou could also come into contention. Barcelona are currently conducting their own renovation project, at a cost of \u20ac900 million ($954 million), which will take the capacity to 105,000. That would make it the tournament\u2019s biggest arena by some distance, but it does have the handicap of not having hosted a Spanish national team game since 1987, with the exception of the 1992 Olympic Games.

    "description": "Dear Amy: I mow lawns as a side gig.",
    "content": "I mow lawns as a side gig. Several months ago, my lawn mower quit working and one of the people I mow for (the \u201cSmiths\u201d) offered to let me use theirs. I accepted their offer, and told them that as long as I used their lawn mower to mow other lawns, I wouldn\u2019t charge them for mowing theirs. A few weeks ago, another client gave me their old lawn mower (they\u2019d gotten a new one). It was a kind gesture that truly filled my heart with hope. Since then, I have not borrowed the Smith\u2019s mower. I\u2019ve told them that I have a good mower, now. They asked me to continue using theirs on their lawn, and I agreed. Since then, I\u2019ve mowed, weed-whacked and cleaned the grass from their property two times. They thank me and tell me how great it looks \u2026 but they haven\u2019t paid me. I\u2019m trying to figure out a tactful way to ask them for payment. I value them as friends; they\u2019re almost like family. Can you help me to find the words? Judging by my mailbag, the act of asking for money you are owed for services rendered is one of the most uncomfortable situations people face. It is vital for free-lancers (such as yourself) to establish a clear and confident payment policy. The \u201cSmiths\u201d generously let you use their mower to mow their and other clients\u2019 lawns. During that period, you didn\u2019t charge them to mow their lawn. Now that this period has ended, you need to get them back on a payment schedule. Contact them by email to say: \u201cThank you again for lending your mower when I needed it! This generous gesture helped to keep my business going, and I\u2019m very grateful. However, now that I have replaced my mower, I\u2019d like to get you back on a payment schedule. If you\u2019d like me to continue to use your mower for your property, I\u2019d be happy to extend a 20 percent discount [or whatever discount you decide]. With the discount, the fee for your property would be XX for each mowing and weed cleanup. If you don\u2019t want me to use your mower, I\u2019ll use my own. If so, the fee reverts to XX. Please let me know which you would prefer, and we\u2019ll schedule your next mowing. With regards and much gratitude\u2026\u201d The more transparent and professionally you behave in this area of your business, the better it will be for you and your clients. If so, I predict that your business, like the crab grass in my own lawn, will continue to grow. I was on an Alaskan cruise in September. On September 11 the ship made an announcement at about noon that we would have a minute of silence to commemorate 9/11. I was in the dining area. Within a few seconds there was dead silence among the hundreds of people there, many of which were probably not Americans. At the table adjacent to me was a family (who were not speaking English) who continued to talk among themselves. I was tempted to walk over with an image of the World Trade Center on my phone to explain what was going on without speaking. However, I did not do anything but reverently bow my head as the minute passed. They continued to talk during the whole observance. Should I have taken some action? If I was visiting a country where I did not know the language and everyone was suddenly silent I would have followed the crowd and been silent myself. If you are traveling in a country where you don\u2019t speak or understand the language, announcements can sound like white noise. And if you are with other excited people and deeply engaged in conversation, you might not notice that others have fallen silent. I don\u2019t think it was necessary for you to flash a photo of this tragedy in order to drive your point home, but approaching the table, making eye contact, and making the universal symbols for \u201cquiet\u201d and \u201cpraying\u201d might have alerted the group for the need to pay respect. \u201cLost in-law\u201d asked how to refer to his former brother-in-law, who is the father of his niece and nephew. I\u2019ve had that situation for years. My former BIL and I both have kids (who are cousins), so I call him \u201cUncle Norm\u201d and he calls me \u201cUncle Dan.\u201d You nailed it. Great solution!",

    "content": "By A vibrant new mural in celebrates the community\u2019s unique generational strength and diversity. The mural, called \u201cGenerational Spirit,\u201d was unveiled in Central Square on Sept. 27 as the inaugural piece in , a pilot initiative by HarborArts in partnership with East Boston Main Streets. According to its website, the organization\u2019s mission is to \u201cbreathe new life into local communities by strategically placing engaging sculptures, vibrant murals, and interactive artworks in our Main Streets.\u201d The colorful 30-foot-by-40-foot mural was created on the brick wall of the East Boston Social Center at 68 Central Square and depicts three generations \u2014 a girl, a woman, and an older man. According to the organization, the mural will be \u201ca beacon of neighborhood pride,\u201d featuring the work of local artists Silvia Lopez Chavez and Felipe Ortiz. The artists began painting the mural in early September. They say the message behind the piece is a celebration of local diversity and the support system that exists between generations in the community. \u201cEach generation is supporting each other, is proud of who they are and what they bring to the table, and also lifting the future,\u201d Lopez Chavez WGBH, adding that the use of patterns on the mural\u2019s background represents a multitude of cultures.

    "description": "Owner Jeff Nace highlights his top picks from the North End restaurant's menu. The post What to order at Neptune Oyster appeared first on Boston.com.",
    "content": "By Jeff Nace, owner of the North End\u2019s palpable , began our conversation by referring to the iconic Italian neighborhood as \u201cthe belly of Boston.\u201d When he opened the seafood-savvy restaurant on Salem Street in 2004, however, crustaceans and crudo strayed exponentially from the area\u2019s traditional and In fact, that\u2019s how Nace conceptualized the restaurant. He was working in the North End and recalled how tourists would regularly ask him where to eat seafood nearby. Though it was established as a unique concept for the North End, it\u2019s become a neighborhood hotspot for locals and tourists alike. \u201cWe\u2019re respecting the neighborhood while doing our own thing,\u201d Nace said. \u201cI think Boston is the seafood capital of the world, and the North End is the belly of Boston, so we\u2019re in a prime location.\u201d From bluefin crostini to a celebrity-approved Monday night special, here are the can\u2019t-miss menu items at Neptune. There\u2019s no better starting point than with a tray of briny bivalves on the half shell. The oyster shuckers greet guests from their window stations behind the decadent raw bar with no less than 12 varieties on display on any given day \u2014 six of which are always local. \u201cThe oyster farmers come directly to us,\u201d said Nace, noting that many of his trusted purveyors are old friends from Martha\u2019s Vineyard all the way up to Maine. All oysters are served with a champagne ros\u00e9 mignonette made with light champagne vinegar and pink peppercorns, as well as classic cocktail sauce with hot pepper horseradish. A signature on Neptune\u2019s menu, the crudo selection always highlights seasonal seafood, from bluefin tuna to fluke to Nantucket Bay scallops. All come lightly adorned and paired with sea salts from as nearby as Duxbury and as far flung as Iceland or Hawaii. \u201cYou want to taste the fish,\u201d Nace said. \u201cI don\u2019t like to cover it up. To me, that\u2019s like putting a mustache on the .\u201d Though Johnnycakes are more famed in their native Rhode Island, Neptune adds a spin on this cornmeal-based pancake with smoked bluefish tartare, a dollop of caviar, and a drizzle of honey butter. \u201cThis [dish] plays a lot of fiddles,\u201d Nace said. \u201cSometimes people get it as an appetizer. Sometimes we put a candle on it and serve it for someone\u2019s birthday as we don\u2019t have dessert on the menu.\u201d \u201cWhen we opened up, Boston was only a one lobster roll town \u2014 they only served it cold,\u201d said Nace, who grew up in Newburyport where his grandmother made hot buttered lobster rolls. He took a page from his grandmother\u2019s book at Neptune with their wildly popular hot buttered lobster served in a toasted brioche roll from Iggy\u2019s bakery. \u201cI think it\u2019s the best bakery in Boston,\u201d Nace said. The restaurant also serves the traditional cold roll with Maine lobster meat tossed in mayo. Whether hot or cold, there\u2019s always eight ounces of fresh lobster made to order. Neptune runs a daily special seven days a week. On Mondays, it\u2019s always the lobster spaghettini: thin noodles in a garlic, white wine, and tomato sauce, smothered in Maine lobster meat, breadcrumbs, and Parmesan cheese (freshly shaved truffles are available if you\u2019re feeling fancy). Aside from being a fan-favorite among locals, it\u2019s received the Hollywood stamp of approval, Nace said. During filming for \u201cThe Departed,\u201d Nace served it to Leonardo DiCaprio. \u201cHe didn\u2019t say a word for three minutes, then all he said was \u2018wow\u2019 three times,\u201d Nace said. \u201cI wish I had it on film!\u201d Stay up to date on the latest food news from Boston.com.

    "content": "The family of a North Carolina man who drowned last year after he drove off a collapsed bridge while following Google Maps directions has sued Google for negligence, saying that the company\u2019s failure to update its maps led directly to his death. Philip Paxson, 47, a medical device salesperson, was on his way home from his daughter\u2019s camping-themed ninth birthday party in Hickory, North Carolina, on Sept. 30, 2022, navigating a rainy night on unfamiliar roads, when he drove off a collapsed roadway into a creek and drowned, according to the lawsuit, which was filed in Wake County Superior Court on Tuesday. Alicia Paxson, his wife, also sued two businesses and an individual who the lawsuit says owned, controlled or were responsible for the collapsed bridge, which was unmarked, with no barricades. Paxson had taken their two daughters home from the party in her car, while her husband stayed late to clean up and drove separately, she said in an interview. \u201cThis is horrific, what our family is going through,\u201d she said. When she thinks about how easily it could have been prevented, given that people had warned Google about the dangerous route it was suggesting, \u201cit just kills me,\u201d she said. Paxson said she searched her husband\u2019s phone after the accident and found that he had looked up directions home from the party on Google Maps. A Google spokesperson, Jos\u00e9 Casta\u00f1eda, said in a statement that the company, which is owned by Alphabet, had the deepest sympathies for the Paxson family. \u201cOur goal is to provide accurate routing information in Maps, and we are reviewing this lawsuit,\u201d he said. Google Maps has for years directed drivers to cross the bridge, which collapsed in 2013, according to the lawsuit. In November 2020, Google Maps acknowledged receipt of a complaint that a Hickory resident had submitted about the dangerous route recommendation, but it continued to suggest the route, according to the lawsuit. \u201cThis was a crater literally in the middle of a residential neighborhood,\u201d said Robert Zimmerman, a lawyer for Paxson. \u201cIt\u2019d be one thing if it was there for a day or a week, but it was there for nine years.\u201d Nearly a year after Philip Paxson\u2019s death, Zimmerman said, the bridge has not been repaired, and Google Maps is still directing drivers to cross it. Google and the other defendants \u2014 Hinckley Gauvain LLC; Tarde LLC; and James Tarlton, who, according to state records, owns Tarde \u2014 would be served with the lawsuit paperwork in the coming weeks, Zimmerman said. The companies and Tarlton could not immediately be reached, and it was not clear if they had legal representation. Zimmerman said that there was no valid reason for the companies and Tarlton, who were responsible for maintaining the bridge, to have left it in such a dangerous state for so long, with no barricades, warning signs or lighting around it. A spokesperson for the North Carolina Department of Transportation said in an email Thursday that \u201cthe section of road where this incident occurred is owned by a private entity\u201d and that the department \u201chas no legal authority to make improvements to this location.\u201d The lawsuit said that Google Maps and other mapping and navigation platforms had the responsibility to update their maps in a timely manner and to correct routes once they were notified of hazards. The lawsuit raises a question for GPS developers: Who is liable when injuries or fatalities occur because of faulty directions? The question has become particularly relevant for Google Maps, the most popular mapping service in the United States. In 2018, 72% of smartphone users looked up directions on Google Maps, according to Statista, a market insight company. The next most popular app was Waze, which is owned by Google, which was used by 12% of smartphone owners that year. GPS services have come under criticism not just for directing drivers through hazardous routes but also for disorienting hikers. Mountaineering Scotland, a climbing organization, and the John Muir Trust, a charity that maintains natural areas in Britain, have warned that Google Maps may direct hikers to trails that would lead them over cliffs and rocky, steep terrain.",

    "description": "These characters were part of a suite of products that Meta introduced in September -- all powered by artificial intelligence \u2014 and that will soon be found throughout its products.",
    "content": "MENLO PARK, Calif. \u2014 In a WhatsApp text conversation this week, we asked Jane Austen \u2014 yes, the 19th-century British author \u2014 how she felt about Mr. Darcy, a character from one of her most famous works, \u201cPride and Prejudice.\u201d After a few seconds, Austen responded. \u201cAh, Mr. Darcy. Everyone remembers him as one of my characters,\u201d she said, her face appearing in a small window above our conversation. \u201cBut fewer people have read one of my books,\u201d she added, with an arched eyebrow and what seemed like a hint of resentment. Austen was not talking to us. But a modern interpretation of her likeness was used by Meta, which owns WhatsApp, Facebook and Instagram, as part of an artificially intelligent character that could chat across the company\u2019s messaging apps. Characters based on other people\u2019s likenesses \u2014 including former quarterback Tom Brady, social media influencers Beast and Charlie D\u2019Amelio, and hip-hop artist Snoop Dogg \u2014 were also available to converse. These characters were part of a suite of products that Meta introduced in September \u2014 all powered by artificial intelligence \u2014 and that will soon be found throughout its products, including Instagram, Messenger, and virtual- and augmented-reality devices like the Quest 3 headset and Ray-Ban Stories smart glasses. The rollout also includes a chatbot that will be powered partly by Microsoft\u2019s Bing search engine, as well as AI-assisted image-editing tools to use on Instagram. \u201cMost people haven\u2019t had the chance to experience\u201d the newest and most powerful AI technologies, Mark Zuckerberg, Meta\u2019s CEO, said Wednesday. \u201cThat\u2019s a thing that I think we can change.\u201d He added, \u201cPeople aren\u2019t going to want to interact with one single super intelligent AI \u2014 people will want to interact with a bunch of different ones.\u201d Meta is aiming to keep pace with OpenAI, Google, Microsoft and other companies in the frenzied race over AI that can instantly generate text, images and other media on its own. Since November, when OpenAI unexpectedly launched the chatbot ChatGPT, Silicon Valley executives have embraced the technology as the next big shift in computing \u2014 and struggled not to be left behind. For Meta, widespread acceptance of its new AI products could significantly increase engagement across its many apps, most of which rely on advertising to make money. More time spent in Meta\u2019s apps means more ads shown to its users. While Meta has worked on AI behind the scenes for years, it was initially slow to introduce products with generative AI, especially as it focused on transforming into a metaverse company. To catch up, Zuckerberg overhauled the company to focus on building AI-focused products like the ones introduced Wednesday, holding weekly meetings with his executive team to discuss the progress. Now Meta is using its tried-and-true playbook of leveraging its enormous size \u2014 globally, more than 3 billion people use its products \u2014 to popularize its offerings. And whereas interactions with ChatGPT and Google\u2019s Bard chatbot have largely been between an individual and the bot or within productivity programs like Gmail, Zuckerberg envisions users of Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp interacting with chatbots more socially in their everyday conversations and group chats with friends. For example: If two friends chatting on WhatsApp want to find a good breakfast spot in San Francisco on Sunday morning, they might naturally turn to Meta\u2019s new chatbot, Meta AI, to ask, \u201cWhere is the best place for eggs Benedict in San Francisco?\u201d Within a few seconds, Meta\u2019s digital assistant would mine Microsoft\u2019s Bing search engine for real-time web results, and use its underlying AI to spit out a short, conversational response. (People who want more specific information can click on linked footnotes in the response, which would redirect them to Bing search results in another window.) Other social networking apps have also started weaving in AI abilities. Snap added a chatbot this year to its social media service, Snapchat, which is popular among teenagers. Its chatbot is embodied by a digital avatar that users can rename and customize. And Character.AI, a Silicon Valley startup, offers a service in which people can chat with a reasonable facsimile of almost anyone, living or dead. Meta\u2019s new character-like bots work similarly to Snapchat\u2019s offering \u2014 and a little like the digital personalities offered by Character.AI. One Meta AI character \u2014 Amber, modeled after Paris Hilton \u2014 plays a detective partner for \u201csolving whodunits\u201d in chats. Kendall Jenner\u2019s character, called Billie, is described as a \u201cNo BS, ride-or-die companion.\u201d Tennis star Naomi Osaka\u2019s character, Tamika, is an \u201canime-obsessed Sailor Senshi in training,\u201d while Snoop Dogg plays a Dungeon Master in a sendup of Dungeons and Dragons with a \u201cchoose your own adventure\u201d type of experience. The celebrities and athletes are being paid for their AI characters; Meta did not provide details on compensation. The characters are a way for people to have fun, learn things, talk recipes or just pass the time \u2014 all within the context of connecting with friends and family, company executives said. \u201cWe see people going to different AIs for different things, which is how we see ourselves building out an ecosystem of many more AIs over time,\u201d said Ahmad Al-Dahle, Meta\u2019s vice president of generative AI. But like other chatbots, Meta\u2019s chatbots can generate false and misleading information \u2014 a phenomenon that researchers call hallucination. This can happen even when the bot bases its answer on what it grabs from a search engine. When we asked the Meta AI assistant, \u201cWho won the 1904 World Series?,\u201d it incorrectly said \u201cthe New York Giants\u201d and asked if it could help with anything else. When we then asked if the World Series was even played in 1904, the bot adjusted and correctly said there was no 1904 World Series because the Giants refused to play. Like Microsoft, OpenAI and others, Meta is also offering a tool for instantly generating photorealistic images. Users will be able to instantly create AI-produced photos or sticker emoji reactions inside the company\u2019s messaging apps based on whatever they type into the chat prompt, with some limitations. This kind of image-generating technology can be used to spread disinformation online. To guard against this possibility, Meta said, images created with the tool will be marked with an icon indicating they were created by AI. Al-Dahle said Meta had spent thousands of hours doing \u201cred team\u201d scenarios to test the potential misuse of the technologies. The company has also published a set of responsible-use guidelines for those who want to use Meta\u2019s underlying technology to eventually power their own chatbots. Many of the products will also be rolled out in a limited capacity to U.S. users only, as the company works out any early kinks and watches how users respond. A future with legions of chatbots could be closer than we might think. Meta\u2019s public release in July of LLaMA 2 \u2014 the code behind its latest and most advanced AI technology \u2014 was enthusiastically greeted by developers and has been downloaded more than 30 million times. Meta is working with Microsoft, Google and Amazon\u2019s cloud services divisions to host the technology for developers who want to create the next generation of bots that can do whatever the coders want them to do \u2014 for better or worse. For now, the AI-powered Austen would say only so much. When we asked at what age a woman should marry, she refused to answer. \u201cMy goodness, you want me to dictate your love life?\u201d she said. \u201cMarry whenever you find someone who can tolerate your eccentricities. And you theirs.\u201d This article originally appeared in .",

    "content": "Kaiser Permanente Colorado employees who went on strike this week over wages and staffing levels were expected to return to work Saturday morning, but could walk out again next month if they don\u2019t reach a deal. Stephanie Felix-Sowy, president of Service Employees International Union Local 105, said the striking unions and Kaiser Permanente will resume negotiations Thursday, and members are hopeful that their three-day walkout will lead to agreement on a new contract. SEIU Local 105 represents about 3,000 technicians, office workers, licensed practical nurses and others who were on strike at Kaiser Permanente Colorado, part of a national labor action by unions representing tens of thousands of Kaiser workers in multiple states. \u201cIt sounds like Kaiser is eager to get back,\u201d Felix-Sowy said. If negotiations don\u2019t progress, the bargaining team will check with members to see whether they want to pursue another strike, Felix-Sowy said. Because members , they wouldn\u2019t need to take a full vote again, she said. About were in favor of authorizing a strike. \u201cEverybody knows that the option of going out again in November has been part of the plan,\u201d she said. Close to half of Kaiser Permanente Colorado\u2019s 6,800 employees . They\u2019re scheduled to resume work at 6 a.m. Saturday. Physicians, registered nurses and others were still working during the strike, allowing office visits to continue. Kaiser Permanente Colorado did close 11 pharmacies and 21 labs, and didn\u2019t offer routine X-rays at 24 imaging departments. The organization, which is both a health care provider and a nonprofit insurance company, has about 500,000 members in Colorado and runs 33 medical offices statewide. Kelli Kane, vice president of ambulatory operations at Kaiser Permanente Colorado, said office visits went \u201csmoothly,\u201d because they were able to move some people\u2019s appointments up to before the strike, and administrators helped out with support tasks like checking in patients. They had to consolidate some services, because it was more challenging to find substitutes with those specific skills, she said. It\u2019s possible there will be an increase in appointments next week, because some people didn\u2019t want to cross a picket line, but they don\u2019t expect a significant bottleneck, Kane said. \u201cKaiser Permanente\u2019s top priority is caring for our patients,\u201d she said. The sides haven\u2019t sat down to talk since midday Wednesday, . Unions representing Kaiser Permanente employees in other states were also on strike, with about .

    "content": "PARIS - Editors, influencers and fashion commentators have spent the past few days expressing dismay over the deluge of White male creative directors at fashion houses, following the appointment of former JW Anderson designer Sean McGirr to Alexander McQueen, which had been designed since 2010 by Sarah Burton. But on the last day of Paris Fashion Week, girl power was firing on all cylinders. Tuesday offered a trio of shows from female designers that showed the pleasures of being a girl, the little struggles and moments of frazzledness to which many women might relate. Much of popular culture has coalesced around this moment of peak girl - Taylor Swift and Beyonce's unprecedented concert success, the record-breaking performance of \"Barbie\" and even a new eating habit called \"girl dinner.\" Somehow, fashion, which is supposed to be all about the future, remains behind - which is what made a day of shows by Virginie Viard of Chanel, Laura and Deanna Fanning at Kiko Kostadinov, and Miuccia Prada at Miu Miu feel so relevant. Maybe no designer better understands the way you want to dress if you're young, unstoppable and fabulously wealthy than Viard. Clients arrive doused in Chanel, their eyes widening at the sight of Usher, Chris Rock, Brie Larson and Pen\u00e9lope Cruz (and each others' handbags). Viard has an impressive ability to create clothes that look delightful and sophisticated, and while some old-school fashion fans find her work underwhelming, suggesting her mishmash styling can sometimes be harsh on the eye, she nails the way young women, experimenting with their style and self-conception, fling things together and stride out into the world with that mix of confidence and naivet\u00e9. Flip-flops and geeky glasses with mommy's long tweed coat? Ha! Matching striped skirts and tops? Even her little tweed suits look like tasty pastries for an influencer in the making. Though Viard herself seems subdued and chic in the classic Parisian sense, she shines when she goes Valley Girl and a bit tacky. There's so much fatigue around logos these days - they seem so obvious! - yet those double C's feel somehow unimpeachable, even to the coolest and most understated women. (Not for nothing: The house increased the prices of its handbags by 16 percent in March, and they continue to fly off the shelves.) More earthbound was the Spring collection by the Fannings, the Australian twins behind womenswear at the cult menswear label Kiko Kostadinov. (Kostadinov is Laura's fianc\u00e9.) The pieces were like feminist Dr. Seuss: delicately swaggy tops and dresses whose tucks bopped around to flatter the body in different ways on tops and dresses; funky stripes layered in pretty patches; a bomber jacket that zipped in a zillion unexpected places; and demurely weird sweaters that seemed turned upside down and backward to make garments that looked like Sargent's Madame X by way of teen-apocalypse filmmaker Gregg Araki. Every piece bore the mark of play, experimentation and creativity - the delights of two women talking, thinking and dreaming together. Just a few seasons ago, their clothes could feel overworked, but now they seem confident, cheerful and exciting - the perfect pieces for someone who really geeks out about interesting clothes, whose mind is equal parts vintage Martin Margiela and the \"Spice World\" soundtrack. Really, this day was rich and thick with the spirit of frivolity, intimacy and invention. The master of this attitude is Miuccia Prada's Miu Miu, where two years ago the designer introduced a hacked-off miniskirt that set off a still-barrelling trend cycle. (Her partnership with stylist Lotta Volkova, who helped Demna reinvent Balenciaga, is a big help.) The clothes progressed from the most mundane version of the school uniform - perhaps the first thing forced upon a young woman that her intuition tells her to push quietly against, subtly asserting her individuality with little tweaks. You make the skirt a bit too short, or layer shirts together, or wear glasses for fun, or make your hair kind of messy - anything to make this conscripted role feel a bit more personal. As the show went on, the clothes became more and more complicated, maybe more adult - little suits, sequin bomber jackets, boxy cocktail dresses and opera coats - with models carrying overstuffed handbags with junk and even an errant shoe hanging out. Mrs. Prada knows how to tell the most relatable story about the daily chaos and mischief of being a woman, puckered with feminine pleasures - rhinestones, miniskirts, pockets, a glam coat. She makes the flirtatious and silly look somehow genius, honoring that time in your life when you're making a lot of mistakes, when you think you know way more than you do and can look fantastic wearing whatever you want on the worst hair day you've had in months. What an intelligent and delightful way to use a fashion runway in 2023. And a reminder to the guys (and women) holding the purse strings that women vote with their dollars: Miu Miu's revenue already jumped 50 percent in the first half of this year.",

    "content": "by: Posted: Updated: ANTWERP, Belgium (AP) \u2014 The acrobatics that Simone Biles tries are so extreme and difficult that even when she does not execute to perfection, she still ends up on a world podium. Biles had to be content with a silver medal on Saturday at the world championships \u2014 her 28th overall since she started her harvest a decade ago \u2014 after she over-rotated her signature Yurchenko double pike and fell backwards on the mat on landing. Rebeca Andrade of Brazil denied Biles a 22nd world title by winning the vault competition ahead of the American superstar. A day after she became the most decorated gymnast in history, Biles tried to claim back the title she last won in 2019 by performing her extremely difficult signature vault that nobody else does in the women\u2019s competition, and only a few men attempt. Biles\u2019 second vault was an excellent Cheng to finish with a combined score of 14.549. Andrade was nearly flawless to snatch the gold medal by a margin of 0.201 points. Yeo Seo-jeong of South Korea took the bronze with 14.416. Olympic vault champion Andrade said she was disappointed to witness Biles failing in her quest for perfection. \u201cI\u2019m happy for my result, but sad about the fall because we know how much athletes train to do this vault,\u201d she said through a translator. Asked whether she would try the Yurchenko double pike in competition, Andrade said it would be a \u201ccrazy\u201d thing to do. \u201cI don\u2019t have the body for that,\u201d she added. Biles became the first woman to do the Yurchenko double pike at the world championships during qualifying, and the vault is now named the Biles II because it was achieved in international competition. The 26-year-old American now has five skills named after her. As usual, the biggest cheers and applause from the crowd during the presentation were for Biles. First on the starting list, she kicked off her meeting with a massive vault but fell on her back upon landing. In addition, Biles took a half-point deduction when she did her Yurchenko because her coach Laurent Landi stood on the mat as a precaution, ready to assist her in case something went wrong. But the start value of the Biles II is so high that even the fall did not hurt her chances of medaling. After getting 15.000 points for her first vault, Andrade \u2014 who was dethroned by Biles in the all-around final \u2014 then nailed a superb double twisting Yurchenko to cap her day in style. Biles had also qualified for the uneven bars final Saturday, but her routine doesn\u2019t have the difficulty of the top athletes in this discipline and she finished fifth. Her U.S. teammate Shilese Jones collected the bronze medal behind 16-year-old Qiu Qiyuan of China, the new world champion with 15.100 points. Kaylia Nemour of Algeria was runner-up. Biles is competing at her first world championships since 2019. Her silver came a day after the four-time Olympic gold medalist won her sixth all-around crown. She also led the U.S women to a record seventh straight win in the team event earlier this week in the Belgian port city. Biles, who has won a record 35 medals at the world championships and Olympics, has returned to competition this summer after a two-year break that she used to focus on her mental wellbeing following the Tokyo Olympics. In the men\u2019s competition, Rhys McClenaghan won gold to defend his title on the pommel horse ahead of Khoi Young of the United States, who secured silver in his first world championships. It was the third medal since the start of the competition for the U.S. men\u2019s team. Ahmad Abu Al-Soud, of Jordan, was third. Young had a fall on the pommel horse during the team\u2019s final when the U.S. won the bronze medal. \u201cI really wanted to prove to myself and the team that I can be trusted in high pressure situations,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that\u2019s what I really proved today.\u201d Olympic champion Artem Dolgopyat of Israel won the floor title with 14.866 points ahead of Kazuki Minami of Japan. Milad Karimi of Kazakhstan completed the podium. Yang Liu\u2019s stunning display of power in the men\u2019s rings final earned him 15.233 points, enough for the reigning Olympic champion from China to win the world title ahead of a former Olympic gold medalist, Eleftherios Petrounias of Greece. Liu\u2019s teammate You Hao completed the podium. Biles will be back in action on Sunday for the floor and balance beam finals. ___ AP sports: https://apnews.com/hub/apf-sports Copyright 2023 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

    "content": "by: Posted: Updated: HOUSTON (AP) \u2014 Houston reliever Kendall Graveman was left off the AL Division Series roster against the Minnesota Twins because of right shoulder discomfort. Graveman, who was acquired in a trade with the White Sox in July, was 2-2 with a 2.42 ERA in 23 appearances for Houston this season. For the Twins, designated hitter Byron Buxton remained out with a sore knee after also being left off the Wild Card Series roster. The only change Minnesota made from that round was to add Game 1 starter Bailey Ober for left-hander Kody Funderburk, who did not play in the wild card. Buxton hasn\u2019t played since Aug. 1 but took live batting practice Friday and hoped he could return against the Astros. Houston\u2019s roster features four players who will be making their postseason debuts in catcher Yainer Diaz, right-hander J.P. France, infielder Grae Kessinger and first baseman Jon Singleton.

    "description": "Dylan has never considered his songs as sacrosanct classics that should be preserved in amber.",
    "content": "\u201cI\u2019m a man of contradictions,\u201d sang Bob Dylan at the opening of his three-night stand at the Cadillac Palace Theatre. \u201cAnd a man of many moods.\u201d That he is, and on Friday, all points led back to those proclamations during a nuanced, 110-minute performance that found the iconic artist in an engaged, borderline gregarious state of mind. The famously all-business singer-songwriter spoke to express his gratitude on several occasions and even treated the near-capacity crowd to a rare sight: a wide grin underlining his appreciation. Advertisement More importantly, Dylan sounded relatively clear, his revitalized voice still free of the congested rasp and cragginess present during countless shows in the aughts. A welcome thing, too, since he framed most arrangements around inventive vocal phrasing and understated piano lines. Wearing shades of black and gray, a capable band followed his lead, largely hanging back in the shadows to better allow songs a chance to insinuate, linger, simmer or strike. Together, the sharp-dressed Dylan and his support quintet \u2014 newly refreshed by the addition of Jerry Pentecost on drums \u2014 drew heavily from the 2020 double LP \u201cRough and Rowdy Ways.\u201d They served as guides through hybrid rockabilly, country and folk landscapes strewn with bloodlust, pain, greed, wrath and power struggles. A longtime wearer of masks, Dylan seldom reveals his overt intent. Yet the connections to contemporary situations and issues were impossible to miss. Advertisement For good measure and balance, the Minnesota native threw in a bit of romance. And, specifically for Chicago, a pair of well-chosen blues covers to bookend the proceedings. In particular, \u201cBorn in Chicago,\u201d a stark commentary on gun violence originally recorded by Paul Butterfield Blues Band. Members of that group backed Dylan when he plugged in, polarized his fan base and transformed popular music at the 1965 Newport Folk Festival . At 82, Dylan continues to provoke and shape. He remains a social scholar and master of unpredictability, the equivalent of an analog enthusiast living in a digital era. Fans attending his Chicago dates were mailed physical tickets that look like tear-off stubs saved as souvenirs from events in the late \u201880s. No visible barcodes, so small they fit in the palm of a hand. Everyone also placed their phones in sealed pouches upon entrance. So much for any social media posts. Indeed, in an era in which any promise of astonishment usually gets derailed by the incessant rush to flood channels with information, Dylan stands as an outcast determined to preserve the sanctity of surprise. Years often pass before he issues a new album with scant notice. His most recent LP (\u201cShadow Kingdom\u201d) aptly sees the veteran reinterpret 13 of his earlier works \u2014 a creative method that\u2019s informed his concerts for decades. Last year, he released a book. Not a sequel to his celebrated \u201cChronicles: Volume One\u201d (2004) memoir but an homage to songwriting and the practitioners he believes nailed the craft (\u201cThe Philosophy of Modern Song\u201d). That document, too, functions as an extension of a mentality that\u2019s witnessed Dylan maintain a busy tour schedule. Staying on the road and refusing to allow age or trends to dictate circumstance, he embraces the same spirit as the bygone blues legends and turn-of-the-century troubadours who inspired him. That ethos informed even the few well-known cuts Dylan and Co. played, each receiving inside-out treatments that revealed fresh meanings, angles and possibilities. Rather than viewing favorites such as \u201cMost Likely You Go Your Way (And I\u2019ll Go Mine)\u201d as sacrosanct classics that should be preserved in amber, the singer-pianist treated them as pieces of clay to be molded and tweaked. \u201cWhen I Paint My Masterpiece\u201d ventured so far from its original incarnation as to feature a few lyrical twists before conveying the zeal, color and commotion of an outdoor European market. A telltale sign every instance it happened, Dylan shot up from his piano bench and stood to pound the keys, the transition combining with his band\u2019s rhythmic shuffling to conjure the jubilant exchanges of an ensemble woodshedding in a garage or basement. \u201cGotta Serve Somebody\u201d similarly benefited from an overhaul, its basic truths dispensed amid honky-tonk accents and call-and-response guitar riffs. His right foot visibly bobbing under the piano, Dylan proved just as commanding and controlled on balladic material. He strolled through \u201cI\u2019ll Be Your Baby Tonight\u201d sans accompaniment until the midpoint when his band entered and laid down upbeat boogie-woogie grooves. The tune soon resumed its languid pace, the tempo trickery ceding to Dylan\u2019s fine croon and declarative warmth. As for \u201cThat Old Black Magic\u201d? Dylan possessed that, too, figuratively as well as on a frisky rendition of the Johnny Mercer staple that adopted the train-whistle cry of a pedal-steel guitar and clatter of railroad cars rolling down a track. Save for a stomping, spring-loaded romp through \u201cGoodbye Jimmy Reed,\u201d Dylan opted for a pensive, reflective approach to the wealth of recent material. He relied on his voice, and trusted his band to respond to how he stretched or shrank syllables; emphasized or suspended certain words; snapped at or snuggled against rhymes; and used his cadence as a percussive tool. Dylan struck conversational tones and relayed lyrics in cool, deceptively calm manners. He couldn\u2019t be ruffled, and unlike the strings of notes and off-kilter time signatures that traced zigzag patterns, wouldn\u2019t bend. Advertisement Admirable qualities when overseeing tales involving pirates, braggarts, rogues and apparitions. Dylan delivered threats and avowed vengeance with a proverbial smile. He reveled in the exaggeration, absurdity and humor embedded in the intense details, images, symbolism and allusions. Myths or parables, riddles or rhymes: Stripped-back versions of the fever-dream \u201cFalse Prophet\u201d and epic \u201cCrossing the Rubicon\u201d blended the disciplines, the tenderness of Dylan\u2019s singing seemingly belying the narratives\u2019 implied cruelty and distress. Or maybe the vocalist was simply coming to terms with the world and his lot, the assuredness an indication of experience, learnedness and the recognition of someone who \u201ccan see the history of the whole human race.\u201d Dylan made the latter statement amid the lightly trotting \u201cMy Own Version of You,\u201d on which he name-checked Biblical figures, Liberace, Sigmund Freud and Al Pacino among many others. The black-and-white noir of \u201cI Contain Multitudes\u201d and graceful plea \u201cMother of Muses\u201d spilled with more references, the songs splitting the middle between good and evil, need and desire. Messy territory, and not for the faint of heart or those lacking fortitude. After more than 60 years of exploring the human condition and winning a Nobel Prize for his efforts, Dylan should know.

    "description": "Over the past several months there has been an onslaught of Biden administration policies designed with one goal: to rapidly deport people.",
    "content": "For six years, I have represented adults, children and families who have fled persecution in their home countries and sought protection in the United States. My clients have traveled thousands of miles from countries including Nicaragua, Venezuela, Cameroon, Togo, Haiti, El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border to seek asylum. They leave their homes, communities and culture because the pain and risks of fleeing pale in comparison to the dangers they will face if they stay. I have seen the difference between the outcomes for clients who have meaningful access to legal counsel and due process, who are able to safely settle into a community as they pursue their cases, and people who are deprived of these basic human rights. But over the past several months there has been an onslaught of Biden administration policies designed with one goal: to rapidly deport people. These programs block people from a fair asylum process, and I am deeply concerned that thousands of individuals fleeing persecution will never be able to tell their stories and have a chance at safety in our country. For the clients I have helped win asylum, the key to my representation was consistent and thorough communication. Through multiple sessions, we built a rapport, I provided them with information about their legal rights and the immigration system and they provided me with the details of their lives. These details formed the basis of their legal claims, which I assisted them in presenting to the immigration judge. The judge decided whether they could stay in the United States based on an individualized determination of their future risk of harm if deported. When one of my clients and her six-year-old daughter completed their two-month journey from El Salvador to Texas, Customs and Border Protection detained them for three days and then released them with notice of their obligation to appear in immigration court. They made their way to the Midwest, where they sought legal representation. At the National Immigrant Justice Center, my colleagues and I worked with the mother over several months to document her experiences of being raped, impregnated, beaten and locked up at home by her older relative. Finally safe in the United States, she started therapy and began working at a restaurant to support herself and her daughter. At her final immigration court hearing, she bravely testified about her traumatic past, and the immigration judge granted both mother and daughter asylum. Since last spring, my colleagues and I attempted to provide legal services to adults and families who, like that mother and daughter, fled threats and harm in their home countries, but faced very different circumstances at the border under the Biden administration\u2019s new policies that favor rapid deportation and bar many people from the process altogether. First, we served adult asylum seekers at the U.S.-Mexico border, who face truncated initial screenings while in CBP detention. There, the government permits only telephonic communication with attorneys. I spoke with a man who fled Honduras because of gang threats. My goal was to assess his case, provide him with guidance on the asylum process and offer to represent him for his initial screening. After a few minutes on the phone, with my client in a cramped phone booth without paper and pencil, I learned that he already had completed his initial asylum screening before he was able to speak with me. A CBP officer had told him that he could call either an attorney or his family, and he chose his family. He did not yet know whether he had passed his initial screening. After reviewing his claim, I offered to represent him if he received a negative determination, so we could request that a judge reconsider. Despite my efforts to inform the government that I was my client\u2019s attorney, after he received a negative finding, the immigration judge proceeded to review his case in a hearing without me present. He was deported, having faced the full screening and review process alone. He was not alone in facing systemic barriers to counsel. More recently, my organization began serving families under Immigration and Customs Enforcement\u2019s new . Unlike adults, families are released from CBP custody within days of arriving in the United States. However, families have their asylum screening within a day or two of their release, leaving them with virtually no time to find an attorney. Meanwhile, ICE subjects parents to house arrest and GPS ankle monitoring, tempering any consolation that they are \u201creleased\u201d as ICE borrows from the criminal legal system to punish and surveil migrants, even children and families. A man, his wife and two small children came to the United States to flee persecution they had experienced in their Indigenous community and were placed in FERM in Chicago. By the time we met, the man had already failed his initial screening. The government had screened him in Spanish, a language he did not understand or read fluently. Unlike my previous client, I had a chance to appear for this immigration court hearing and avert the deportation of this entire family. But many more under FERM never even reach an attorney, making it all but inevitable that they will be deported unjustly. With both FERM and the ongoing policy of subjecting adults to fear screenings in CBP custody, the Biden administration has created a deportation mill, subjecting families \u2014 many of them Indigenous \u2014 to proceedings so fast they can\u2019t call a lawyer, let alone have basic interpretation services to share their stories. Immigration legal advocates know firsthand that the real-world consequence of these policies is that people are denied due process and deported to places where they face further harm. These programs have no place in the U.S. immigration system.",

    "content": "For even the most experienced home chefs, adventuring into new territory and preparing a cuisine you're unfamiliar with can be quite intimidating. Sushi is one of those foods that many of us leave to the experts at our favorite Japanese restaurants. However, for a lot of us, getting takeout sushi every week just isn't monetarily realistic. When your next sushi craving calls, you can either continue to skip the nori wrapping and make yet another , or you can go all in and make one outstanding platter of homemade sushi thanks to some helpful tips from chef James Dumapit of and Rosella in NYC. According to this Manhattan-based chef, fresh, quality ingredients can transform a simple platter of sushi from subpar fare to one outstanding meal. Besides investing in a top-of-the-line rice cooker, chef's knife, and rolling mat,Dumapit gives the skinny on which ingredients and techniques are worth your while. Since sushi isn't composed of countless one-off ingredients, the quality of the food you choose for this Japanese-style cuisine is crucial. Luckily, with an array of fresh food and an open mind, you are only a few steps away from creating delicious at-home sushi in no time. James Dumapit and his partner Jeff Miller have always strived to find the best ingredients available for their innovative dishes at both of their restaurants in New York City. Along with restaurant owner TJ Provenzano, this trio has taken the concept of to new heights. With that said, Dumapit recommends home chefs choose only quality ingredients. Since most traditional sushi is composed of certain anchoring foods, the quality of these foundational ingredients should be unmatched. Dumapit claims, \"Great vinegar, mirin, konbu, and obviously, rice, can make the most humble ingredients seem exceptional.\" Instead of stressing about the ratio of raw tuna to salmon in your homemade rainbow roll, focus on procuring exceptional ingredients. Dumapit also advises home chefs to adhere to an even texture balance when composing any sushi variety. \"You want the fish to be cold, the rice to be warm, and the nori to have snap,\" he explains. As you start to feel more confident adhering to these supreme sushi standards, tap more into your culinary creativity and utilize your favorite fried foods, crisp vegetables, and fruit to give your sushi some multi-dimensional crunch and flavor. Next to choosing top-of-the-line ingredients, you can also use different sushi-making techniques. Now that you know securing high-quality sushi staples is just as important as obtaining the freshest fish and vegetables, the way in which you prepare your homemade sushi is another component to consider. Instead of fretting over perfecting your sushi rolls, or crafting the right-sized nigiri, impress yourself and any potential dinner guests with a few less complicated sushi formations. Whether or not you're familiar with , there is more to this Japanese mainstay than overcomplicated assembly. According to Dumapit, an easy method for beginners is hand-formed sushi balls. The chef states \"They are easy to assemble en masse and look really cool.\" There are many instructional videos online, most of which involve wrapping ingredients in plastic wrap and removing them to reveal perfectly round fish-laden rice balls. Dumapit also recommends attempting oshizushi, which is a layered type of sushi made in a special wooden or plastic contraption called an oshibako box. While ideally, you need one of these boxes to get your layers of fish and rice lined up perfectly, this is a great tool to keep on hand if you plan on making sushi a regular weeknight staple. Making sushi at home doesn't need to be complicated. If you follow the recommendations of Dumapit, with quality ingredients and a few fun techniques, you're well on your way to making one impressive platter of sushi right in your own kitchen.",

Biden designated Qatar as major non-NATO ally of U.S. only last year. Sickening. We should withdraw all of our bases from Qatar and never do business with them again. Our country has to wonder how safe our military personnel are in Qatar at this time. The Qatari government \u201cholds Israel solely responsible\u201d for Hamas invading Israel, butchering civilians, and taking hostages This is the most contemptible official statement I\u2019ve seen from a government account in quite a while And we still treat them as an ally while their operatives roam American lobbying offices and think tanks without even being registered foreign agents. Our government practically rolls out the red carpet for them. Think of all the Americans who\u2019ve taken this regime\u2019s money. Think of our military entanglement. Cool. I'm glad we know where they stand. Now, let's add Qatar to the list of targets! At minimum, maybe we should stop treating them as special friends. This is from the same country that hosted a World Cup last year. Many spoke out and said it was a travesty due to their human rights issues. Supporters said Qatar had changed. The veil has been well and truly dropped now. Turns out, everyone is still who they always were When they tell you who they are, believe them. Predictable statement from an authoritarian regime. Qatar may have an open economy, but it is politically repressed. Qatar needs to be sanctioned by the civilized world Qatar blames the Israeli children for being butchered by Hamas. Cheerleading terrorists. Good luck Qatar. Why does anyone ever fly \ud83e\udd14 Hey and you see this as your organization is racing in Qatar this weekend??????

    "description": "Hello and welcome back to Mod Garage. This month, we will explore the Fender John 5 Ghost Telecaster wiring and how you can adopt it for your own Telecaster. Fender recently released this signature Telecaster in a limited edition of 600 pieces, and they quickly sold out. Before many serious musicians could grab one, collectors with big purses bought them all. So, your only chance to get one now is to look for a used one, or hope that Fender will have mercy and build some more. Or, you can read on to learn what\u2019s inside and how to build your own version of this guitar.I have to confess that this is a matter of heart for me because I\u2019m a John 5 fan. I\u2019m really fascinated with his playing style. This guy can play it all. No matter if he\u2019s picking country swing or shredding death metal, his playing is very close to the traditional tones and techniques, but is always in his own style. Besides this, he\u2019s a very humble guy with a great sense of humor, so I\u2019m really happy to write a piece about his new signature Telecaster.Fender worked very closely with John 5 on this model. At its core, this guitar is a standard HH Telecaster in arctic white\u2014including the neck and fretboard\u2014with red accents that include the binding, nut, knobs, pickups, and more. It\u2019s a matter of taste, if you like this flashy aesthetic or not. Let\u2019s have a look at the basic features, so you have a shopping list if you want to build your own: alder body with HH pickup routings and bindingmaple neck with a medium C shape, 9.5\" radius, and 22 narrow tall frets42 mm synthetic bone nutstring-through Tele bridge with humbucker pickup cutout and six block steel saddlessealed locking tuners1-piece pickguard/control plate combination in mirrored chrome.009\u2013.042 nickel-plated steel stringsWhat makes this guitar really stand out besides its appearance is the wiring, which I think is very special but also minimal. You can put this wiring inside any Telecaster, as long as it accepts two humbuckers. It consists of: two DiMarzio D Activator humbucker pickupsmaster volume control (most likely 500k audio) without treble-bleed networkGibson-style 3-way pickup-selector toggle switchmomentary kill switchThat\u2019s all John 5 needs to sound like no one else, so let\u2019s go through the pieces step by step and see what is under the hood.PickupsThe DiMarzio D Activator humbuckers are passive mid-output pickups with ceramic magnets that have been available since 2006. In the John 5 Ghost Telecaster, both pickups are permanently wired to run as full humbuckers with both coils in series. For the wiring diagram, I used the DiMarzio color code: Green and bare wire are going to ground, black and white are connected and taped off, red is the hot output. If you want to use different humbuckers, you will have to transfer the colors of the wires using one of the numerous color code charts on the internet.On the Ghost Tele, the pickups are red, but they are available in many different colors, too.PotsThere is only a single master volume control, without a treble-bleed network. I haven\u2019t had an opportunity to look at one of these guitars in person, and Fender has not released a wiring diagram, but I\u2019m pretty sure they choose a 500k audio pot together with these pickups, so that\u2019s what I also recommend using.John 5 chose a Gibson-style \u201cspeed knob\u201d in red, but any knob will work.Selector SwitchThe John 5 model uses a standard Gibson 3-way pickup-selector toggle switch (with a red tip, of course) mounted to the upper bout for swift pickup switching. It should be wired like this:bridge pickup as full humbucker aloneboth pickups as full humbuckers in parallelneck pickup as full humbucker aloneIt\u2019s most likely a standard Switchcraft, the short version you can find on all Gibson Les Paul guitars. Naturally, you can use a standard Fender-style 3-way blade switch, but you\u2019ll need a chart to transfer the wiring from the toggle to the blade switch. Use this chart to help you.Kill SwitchInstead of a tone control, there is a kill switch beside the master volume pot (in red ... what else?) that Fender calls \u201carcade style.\u201d And yes, it reminds me a lot of the hardware of the \u201980s game consoles .... Space Invaders or Donkey Kong, anyone?A kill switch is a momentary switch that is usually used for machine gun sounds or stuttering effects. (A momentary switch only cuts off your guitar\u2019s signal against ground while being pressed and resumes normal sound when released.) For a kill switch, you only need a basic on/off 2-position switch. An SPST (single pole-single throw) switch is ideal. SPST switches have only two contacts on the bottom and the switch simply connects (or disconnects) these two terminals to each other when the switch is pressed.\u201cWhat makes this guitar really stand out besides its appearance is the wiring, which I think is very special but also minimal.\u201dBe sure to buy a good quality switch, and make sure it\u2019s a momentary and not a latching type. The type you need is a \u201cnormally open\u201d (off) switch. When you are pressing the switch, you make a connection between the two contacts. The switch returns to the off position when you release the button.There are special high-quality, all-metal kill switches for guitars available. There are also models with an LED inside if you are looking for a cool look. But keep in mind that you will need a battery for the LED, plus space inside the guitar to install it.Here we go for the wiring. As usual, I substituted all ground connections with the international symbol for ground to keep the diagram as clean as possible. The wiring itself is very easy to do and is also a good beginner\u2019s project.That\u2019s it! Next month, we will take a deep dive into something I received many email requests for, because it\u2019s always confusing and not easy to understand: phase and polarity, and the difference between these two pickup parameters. So, stay tuned!Until then ... keep on modding!",

Fender worked very closely with John 5 on this model. At its core, this guitar is a standard HH Telecaster in arctic white\u2014including the neck and fretboard\u2014with red accents that include the binding, nut, knobs, pickups, and more. It\u2019s a matter of taste, if you like this flashy aesthetic or not. Let\u2019s have a look at the basic features, so you have a shopping list if you want to build your own: What makes this guitar really stand out besides its appearance is the wiring, which I think is very special but also minimal. You can put this wiring inside any Telecaster, as long as it accepts two humbuckers. It consists of: That\u2019s all John 5 needs to sound like no one else, so let\u2019s go through the pieces step by step and see what is under the hood. Pickups The DiMarzio D Activator humbuckers are passive mid-output pickups with ceramic magnets that have been available since 2006. In the John 5 Ghost Telecaster, both pickups are permanently wired to run as full humbuckers with both coils in series. For the wiring diagram, I used the DiMarzio color code: Green and bare wire are going to ground, black and white are connected and taped off, red is the hot output. If you want to use different humbuckers, you will have to transfer the colors of the wires using one of the numerous color code charts on the internet. On the Ghost Tele, the pickups are red, but they are available in many different colors, too. Pots There is only a single master volume control, without a treble-bleed network. I haven\u2019t had an opportunity to look at one of these guitars in person, and Fender has not released a wiring diagram, but I\u2019m pretty sure they choose a 500k audio pot together with these pickups, so that\u2019s what I also recommend using. John 5 chose a Gibson-style \u201cspeed knob\u201d in red, but any knob will work. Selector Switch The John 5 model uses a standard Gibson 3-way pickup-selector toggle switch (with a red tip, of course) mounted to the upper bout for swift pickup switching. It should be wired like this: Kill Switch Instead of a tone control, there is a kill switch beside the master volume pot (in red ... what else?) that Fender calls \u201carcade style.\u201d And yes, it reminds me a lot of the hardware of the \u201980s game consoles .... Space Invaders or Donkey Kong, anyone? A kill switch is a momentary switch that is usually used for machine gun sounds or stuttering effects. (A momentary switch only cuts off your guitar\u2019s signal against ground while being pressed and resumes normal sound when released.) For a kill switch, you only need a basic on/off 2-position switch. An SPST (single pole-single throw) switch is ideal. SPST switches have only two contacts on the bottom and the switch simply connects (or disconnects) these two terminals to each other when the switch is pressed. Be sure to buy a good quality switch, and make sure it\u2019s a momentary and not a latching type. The type you need is a \u201cnormally open\u201d (off) switch. When you are pressing the switch, you make a connection between the two contacts. The switch returns to the off position when you release the button. There are special high-quality, all-metal kill switches for guitars available. There are also models with an LED inside if you are looking for a cool look. But keep in mind that you will need a battery for the LED, plus space inside the guitar to install it. Here we go for the wiring. As usual, I substituted all ground connections with the international symbol for ground to keep the diagram as clean as possible. The wiring itself is very easy to do and is also a good beginner\u2019s project. Fig. 1 Illustration courtesy of singlecoil.com That\u2019s it! Next month, we will take a deep dive into something I received many email requests for, because it\u2019s always confusing and not easy to understand: phase and polarity, and the difference between these two pickup parameters. So, stay tuned! Until then ... keep on modding!",

    "description": "Understanding serving size is crucial in making informed decisions. We measured out one serving of 47 items to give you a visual representation of each one.",
    "content": "Understanding serving size is crucial in making informed decisions about what and how much to eat. Doing so, however, isn't always as easy as it may seem. In 2016, the updated the Nutrition Facts Label to more clearly reflect the nutrients for a specific serving size of a packaged food item based on a 2,000-calorie-per-day diet. A primary change to these labels was to more clearly indicate the serving size with a larger, bolder font. Why such a focus on serving size? As it turns out, it is common for food manufacturers to list serving sizes based on a far smaller portion than what consumers generally eat of a particular product. This can create confusion surrounding how healthy a food is, which may cause someone to overindulge. We determined what one serving of each food item was based upon the manufacturer or USDA recommendations and measured these carefully. Where possible, we opted for weight versus volume measurements to more accurately reflect the appropriate serving size, as this can vary widely depending upon the food item. We then placed the correct serving size next to a golf or tennis ball for reference to help provide a visual aid that might take some of the guesswork out of figuring out how much of the food or drink to consume. Read on to see what one serving looks like of 47 different foods and drinks. Cereals vary widely in terms of nutrition, including serving size. In this case, we opted for plain Cheerios. A 1-cup or 28-gram serving of Cheerios is 104 calories. This contains 1.85 grams of fat, 20.5 grams of carbohydrates, 139 milligrams of sodium, 2.83 grams of fiber, 1.26 grams of sugar, and 3.47 grams of protein. Cheerios are also particularly rich in several nutrients, including iron, zinc, and vitamin B12. Milk is available in varieties that contain different percentages of fat. For this comparison, we used 1% (low-fat) milk. A 1-cup or 244-gram serving of 1% milk contains 102 calories. It also has 2.37 grams of fat, 12.2 grams of carbohydrates, 107 milligrams of sodium, no fiber, 12.7 grams of sugar, and 8.22 grams of protein. Milk is also rich in several vitamins and minerals, including vitamin B12, riboflavin, phosphorus, and, notably, a type of calcium readily absorbed in the human body. Some milk products are fortified with vitamin D. is another dairy product available in various fat percentages. We used 1% (low-fat) cottage cheese, which contains 81.4 calories per 1/2-cup or 113-gram serving. It also has 1.15 grams of fat, 3.07 grams of carbohydrates, 459 milligrams of sodium, no fiber, 3.07 grams of sugar, and 14 grams of protein. This nutrient-dense food is packed with B vitamins, phosphorus, selenium, and readily absorbed calcium. Most importantly, up to 70% of the calories in cottage cheese are protein. Yogurt is a food that comes in myriad varieties, many of which are loaded with sugar. For our analysis, we used plain, low-fat Greek yogurt. A 3.5-ounce or 100-gram serving contains 73 calories. There are also 1.92 grams of fat, 3.94 grams of carbohydrates, 34 milligrams of sodium, no fiber, 3.56 grams of sugar, and 9.95 grams of protein. Besides being protein and nutrient-dense, containing vitamin B12, phosphorus, riboflavin, and readily-absorbed calcium, yogurt is a powerhouse in the probiotic department, as noted by the . Probiotics have been linked with improved digestive health, cholesterol management, and boosting immunity. Cheese is one of the foods that shocked us when we looked at what a serving size should be. A single serving of is 1 ounce or 28 grams. Each serving has 100 calories, 8 grams of fat, no carbohydrates, 170 milligrams of sodium, no fiber, no sugar, and 7 grams of protein. In addition to a decent amount of protein, pepper jack is a good source of readily absorbed calcium, with 209 milligrams per serving, 15% of the recommended daily value. It may also be digestible for those who are lactose intolerant, as noted by . One cup or 151 grams of red, seedless grapes is 104 calories. This includes 0.2 grams of fat, 27.3 grams of carbohydrates, 3.02 milligrams of sodium, 1.36 grams of fiber, 23.4 grams of sugar, and 1.09 grams of protein. Grapes also include copper, vitamin K, and myriad B vitamins. The fruit is known for its purported anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anti-microbial, and anti-cancer properties, per . Olive types and serving sizes appear to vary depending on where you search. We opted for pitted kalamata olives. Based on USDA data, we considered a serving size of 30 grams, which equaled about seven smaller-sized kalamatas. This serving has 70 calories, 5 grams of fat, 4 grams of carbohydrates, 640 milligrams of sodium, 2 grams of fiber, and 4 grams of protein. Though olives are a high-fat food, they are loaded with antioxidants. They are also high in oleic acid, a monounsaturated fat linked with lowering the risk of heart disease, staving off cancer, and brightening skin, per a 2023 review in . by size, color, and type. As a general rule, one medium-sized tomato that is roughly 2 \u2157\" in diameter and 123 grams is 22.1 calories. It also has 0.2 grams of fat, 4.78 grams of carbohydrates, 6.15 milligrams of sodium, 1.48 grams of fiber, 3.24 grams of sugar, and 1.08 grams of protein. In addition to being good sources of vitamins C, K, and potassium, a research article in notes that these fruits are lauded for their phytonutrient content, particularly lycopene. Lycopene has been linked with reducing prostate cancer risk and promoting heart health. While are not juvenile iterations of this vegetable, they are convenient snacks to have on hand. A single serving of half a dozen, approximately 85 grams, has 29.8 calories. They also have 0.1 grams of fat, 7 grams of carbohydrates, 66.3 milligrams of sodium, 2.46 grams of fiber, 4.05 grams of sugar, and 0.5 grams of protein. Baby carrots are a great source of vitamins A and K and the antioxidant beta carotene. As noted by he , beta-carotene may help boost immunity, prevent cancer, and promote dental health. Celery may seem like a watery, fibrous vegetable without much substance, but it is nutritious. A single 1-cup or 101-gram serving of chopped celery has just 14 calories. This includes 0.1 grams of fat, 2.97 grams of carbohydrates, 80 milligrams of sodium, 1.6 grams of fiber, 1.34 grams of sugar, and 0.69 grams of protein. Even though celery is a lower-calorie food, it is rife with micronutrients, including potassium, folate, choline, fluoride, and vitamins A and K. Eating celery may help regulate blood sugar, maintain heart health, and support healthy eyes, as noted by the Crackers are great for dipping, but not all are created equally. While several low-calorie, gluten-free crackers exist, for the sake of this round-up, we decided to use classic Wheat Thins as our choice. It's easy to mindlessly consume handfuls, which is why knowing the serving size matters. One serving of Wheat Thins is 16 crackers. This contains 140 calories, 5 grams of fat, 22 grams of carbohydrates, 200 milligrams of sodium, 2.6 grams of fiber, 5 grams of sugar, and 2 grams of protein. Substantial quantities of sugar and sodium make these crackers something to consume sparingly. Tortilla chips are the perfect snack for dipping but like crackers, serving size matters. Most white corn tortilla chips are similar in nutrition. We opted for Tostitos Original Restaurant Style for this comparison. A single serving is 28 grams or about seven chips. Each serving has 140 calories, 7 grams of fat, 19 grams of carbohydrates, 115 milligrams of sodium, no added sugars, 1 gram of fiber, and 2 grams of protein. While tortilla chips are not a valuable source of nutrients, they can be a part of a healthy diet when eaten in moderation. are delicious salty snacks that vary in nutrition depending on whether they are baked or fried and how much salt is added. For our sampling, we used Lay's Wavy Lightly Salted Original flavor. Each 1-ounce serving is approximately 11 chips, far less than most of us eat in one sitting. This meager serving has 160 calories, 10 grams of fat, 15 grams of carbohydrates, 70 milligrams of sodium, less than a gram of sugar, 1 gram of fiber, and 2 grams of protein. Unlike other potato chip varieties, these aren't high in sodium but have a high fat content. are an easy, high-protein snack to have on hand. One large hard-boiled egg has 77.5 calories, 5.3 grams of fat, 0.5 grams of carbohydrates, 62 milligrams of sodium, 0.5 grams of sugar, no fiber, and 6.3 grams of protein. Hard-boiled eggs are abundant sources of vitamins and minerals, including iron, choline, and carotenoids, states . They also contain lutein and zeaxanthin, antioxidants linked with bolstering eye health. Consuming eggs hard-boiled versus poached or over-easy may prevent contamination by salmonella. Chicken is considered a good quality lean protein source, particularly breast meat. What may surprise you is what a serving size of chicken looks like. The recommends a 3.5-ounce or 100-gram portion of boneless, skinless chicken breast. This has 165 calories, 3.57 grams of fat, no carbohydrates, no fiber, no sugar, 74 milligrams of sodium, and 31 grams of protein. The way you cook chicken matters as much as how much you consume. Baking, poaching, roasting, grilling, or steaming without added fat are the best ways to prepare nutritious chicken. A serving of wine is 5 fluid ounces or 147 grams. For red wine, each serving has 125 calories, no fat, 3.84 grams of carbohydrates, no fiber, 0.9 grams of sugar, 5.88 milligrams of sodium, and 0.1 grams of protein. The nutritional values of wine depend upon the type of grape and the vintner. Generally, red wine is marginally better for you than white wine, having higher levels of select vitamins and minerals, as noted by the . In moderation, red wine has been purported to reduce the risk of heart disease, stroke, and certain kinds of cancer. Fresh sweet corn is nutrient-dense. A 1-cup or 149-gram serving of sweet corn has 143 calories, 2.24 grams of fat, 31.3 grams of carbohydrates, 3.58 grams of fiber, 6.76 grams of sugar, 1.49 milligrams of sodium, and 5.08 grams of protein. Corn contains antioxidants like lutein and zeaxanthin, which may help improve eye health, and high fiber content may aid in healthy digestion, lowering the risk of heart disease and preventing certain cancers, per a study in . The key is moderation, particularly for those needing to regulate blood sugar, as corn is a high-glycemic food. Frozen spinach is quick and easy to use. It also is highly nutritious. A 10-ounce package, or one serving, contains 82 calories. It also has 1.6 grams of fat, 12 grams of carbohydrates, 8.2 grams of fiber, 1.8 grams of sugar, 210 milligrams of sodium, and 10.3 grams of protein. As noted by , frozen spinach may be higher in some nutrients than fresh spinach. It is particularly rich in vitamins A and C, calcium, and iron. Popeye was clearly onto something. Pasta in moderation isn't a bad idea. A 1-cup packed or 151-gram serving of enriched spaghetti has 239 calories. It also contains 1.4 grams of fat, 46.7 grams of carbohydrates, 2.72 grams of fiber, 0.8 grams of sugar, 1.51 milligrams of sodium, and 8.76 grams of protein. There may be some benefit to consuming whole-grain pasta versus enriched pasta because it is higher in fiber and micronutrients and lower in carbohydrates and calories, the jury is still out. If you need to monitor your blood sugar levels, your serving size of pasta matters as it is a high-glycemic food source. Rice is a staple of the diets of civilizations across the globe. While brown and white rice may be part of a healthy diet in moderation, brown rice is marginally better for you due to higher levels of fiber, manganese, selenium, magnesium, and folate. A \u2153-cup serving of contains 82 calories. It also has 0.65 grams of fat, 17.05 grams of carbohydrates, 1.1 grams of fiber, 0.16 grams of sugar, 3 milligrams of sodium, and 1.83 grams of protein. Both brown and white rice are high glycemic foods that can adversely influence blood sugar levels in high quantities, as noted by Healthline. Myriad different ice cream brands and flavors are available in the market today. While we used pumpkin ice cream here, but the nutritional content is consistent with regular vanilla ice cream. A 1/2 cup or 65 grams of regular vanilla ice cream has 140 calories. It also has 7.02 grams of fat, 17 grams of carbohydrates, no fiber, 14 grams of sugar, 50 milligrams of sodium, and 2 grams of protein. Because ice cream is a calorie and sugar-dense food, the best rule of thumb is to monitor serving size. A single serving of half an avocado, roughly 100 grams, contains 160 calories. It also has 14.7 grams of fat, 8.53 grams of carbohydrates, 6.7 grams of fiber, 0.66 grams of sugar, 7 milligrams of sodium, and 2 grams of protein. While the fat content of avocados is high, most of these are monounsaturated. A review in the shows that monounsaturated fats have been linked with reducing \"bad\" cholesterol, which may improve heart health. They are also high in fiber and low-glycemic, which may help with weight management and blood sugar regulation. There is a reason why hummus is a staple among cultures across North Africa and the Middle East. A 2-tablespoon serving contains 71.2 calories. It also has 5.34 grams of fat, 5.5 grams of carbohydrates, 1.6 grams of fiber, 0.18 grams of sugar, 127.8 milligrams of sodium, and 2.34 grams of protein. The indicates that hummus may be associated with myriad health benefits, including anti-inflammatory properties, supporting a healthy heart, and regulating blood sugar. It is also loaded with fiber, manganese, copper, folate, and iron. And dare we say, it is delicious. As bread goes, type matters when it comes to nutritional value. Whole wheat bread is healthier because it is made without eliminating the bran or germ from the wheat kernel. This increases the overall fiber, iron, and potassium in the bread, which can improve heart health, aid digestion, and help lower your chance of having a stroke, according to a study in the . One slice of whole wheat bread, which weighs approximately 43 grams, has 80 calories, no fat, 20 grams of carbohydrates, 3.01 grams of fiber, 4 grams of sugar, 170 milligrams of sodium, and 5 grams of protein. Because butter is predominantly fat, it has often been considered to be an unhealthy food. Times are changing though. Dietitians are beginning to recognize that as long as serving size is kept to a minimum, butter can be a part of a healthy diet compared with many other fats. It is also particularly rich in fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, B12, and K2. A single serving of unsalted butter is 1 tablespoon or 14.2 grams. This has 102 calories, 11.5 grams of fat, negligible carbohydrates, no fiber, negligible sugar, 1.56 milligrams of sodium, and 0.12 grams of protein. Sugar is another food that surprised us when we looked at how much is in a single serving. One teaspoon or 4 grams is a single serving of sugar, and it contains 15.4 calories, 0.01 grams of fat, 3.98 grams of carbohydrates, 3.99 grams of sugar, 0.04 milligrams of sodium, no fiber, and no protein. According to at the University of Michigan, because of its lack of nutritional value, sugar is considered to have \"empty calories.\" It is a high glycemic food that is only valuable as a preservative and for providing flavor and texture to foods. Nuts are healthy snacks, but they are the perfect example of too much of a good thing backfiring. A single 1-ounce 28.35-gram serving of roasted, unsalted cashews is 163 calories. They have 13.2 grams of fat, 9.27 grams of carbohydrates, 0.85 grams of fiber, 1.42 grams of sugar, 4.54 milligrams of sodium, and 4.34 grams of protein. Cashews are high in fiber, loaded with heart-healthy unsaturated fats, and have as much protein as an equivalent serving of meat. They also contain copper, magnesium, and manganese. They are a high-calorie food, so eat sparingly and always opt for unsalted nuts. People think they are doing themselves a favor by eating a \"healthy\" salad for lunch. They don't realize that the dressing they put on that salad may be sabotaging their attempts at eating healthy. Serving size is the key. While the nutritional value of different may vary, many are high in calories, fat, and sodium. We took a look at full-fat ranch dressing, which has a serving size of 2 tablespoons or 30 grams. This contains 129 calories, 13.4 grams of fat, 1.77 grams of carbohydrates, no fiber, 1.41 grams of sugar, 270 milligrams of sodium, and 0.3 grams of protein. Peanut butter is an affordable and popular protein source for many individuals. While peanut butter is high in fat, these are predominantly heart-healthy mono- and polyunsaturated varieties. It is also loaded with vitamins and minerals, including folate, potassium, copper, manganese, iron, vitamin E, and B vitamins. A 2-tablespoon or 32-gram serving has 191 calories. It also has 16.4 grams of fat, 7.14 grams of carbohydrates, 1.6 grams of fiber, 3.36 grams of sugar, 136 milligrams of sodium, and 7.1 grams of protein. Because it is calorie-rich, serving size is crucial. While some types of deli meat may be better for you than others, it is necessary to recognize an appropriate serving size. A 2-ounce or 57-gram serving of deli ham is 69 calories. It generally has 2 grams of fat, 1.5 grams of carbohydrates, no fiber, 1.25 grams of sugar, and 11 grams of protein. One downside to deli meats is that they are generally high in sodium content. There is also some concern regarding potentially carcinogenic preservatives known as nitrates and nitrites. The key is moderation. While doctors have warned about consuming too much red meat due to its saturated fat content, some beef can be a part of a healthy diet when consumed in moderation. Beef is a valuable source of iron, zinc, and vitamin B12. The recommends limiting portion sizes of beef to 3 ounces or 85 grams, which is much smaller than we are accustomed to eating. A single serving of has 227 calories, 14.5 grams of fat, no carbohydrates, no fiber, no sugar, 45.9 grams of sodium, and a hefty 22.5 grams of protein. Several health benefits can be attributed to consuming salmon, particularly wild-caught. Salmon is high in omega-3 fatty acids, which have been linked to improving cardiovascular health and mental well-being, according to . It also has significant amounts of vitamin B12, D, selenium, niacin, and phosphorus. A single 3-ounce or 85-gram serving of cooked Atlantic salmon has 175 calories, 10.5 grams of fat, no carbohydrates, and 18.79 grams of protein. While wild salmon is marginally higher in nutrients and lower in calories and fat, it is often more expensive. There are many , and while some may be more nutritious than others, all are healthy and low in calories. Lettuce contains vitamin A, potassium, and polyphenols, which are antioxidants that may help to combat cardiovascular disease, cancer, and diabetes, per . A 1-cup or 36-gram serving of shredded green leaf lettuce contains 5.4 calories. It also has negligible fat, 1.03 grams of carbohydrates, 0.46 grams of fiber, 0.28 grams of sugar, 10.1 milligrams of sodium, and 0.49 grams of protein. Cruciferous vegetables, including broccoli, are nutritional powerhouses. Broccoli is high in fiber, antioxidants, potassium, iron, manganese, folate, and vitamins C and K1. It has been linked with myriad health benefits, including mitigating heart disease, boosting eye health, and preventing cancer, a by-product of sulfur-rich compounds known as isothiocyanates, according to a review in . Each 1-cup or 90-gram serving has 35.1 calories. It also has 0.3 grams of fat, 5.64 grams of carbohydrates, 2.16 grams of fiber, 1.26 grams of sugar, 32.4 milligrams of sodium, and 2.31 grams of protein. They say an apple a day keeps the doctor away. We agree. While apples have fair amounts of fiber, potassium, and vitamin C, their superpower lies in numerous antioxidants, including quercetin, catechin, and chlorogenic acid. These have been linked with preventing certain types of cancer, regulating blood sugar levels, and improving cardiovascular health, as noted in the . A medium apple that is 3 inches in diameter and 182 grams has 94.6 calories. It also contains 0.3 grams of fat, 24.1 grams of carbohydrates, 4.37 grams of fiber, 18.9 grams of sugar, 1.82 milligrams of sodium, and 0.47 grams of protein. Blueberries are a good source of manganese and vitamins C, A, and K, but where they truly shine is in their antioxidant content, which is considered the highest of any fruit or vegetable, according to a survey in the . These antioxidants can help reduce inflammation in virtually every part of the body, helping to lower blood pressure and reduce cholesterol. A 1-cup or 148-gram serving of blueberries has 84.4 calories. They also have 0.48 grams of fat, 21.5 grams of carbohydrates, 3.55 grams of fiber, 14.7 grams of sugar, 1.48 milligrams of sodium, and 1.1 grams of protein. Tofu is an incredibly nutrient-dense and potentially healthy food. The soy protein is one of the few plant-based foods that contains all nine essential amino acids. It is also rich in iron, potassium, manganese, selenium, phosphorus, magnesium, copper, zinc, and vitamin B. It has been linked with the prevention of coronary heart disease, osteoporosis, and some forms of cancer, as noted by, as noted by the . A three-ounce serving contains just 78 calories. It also has 4 grams of fat, 2 grams of carbohydrates, 0.8 grams of fiber, 0.3 grams of sugar, and 8.7 grams of protein. There are a handful of potential health benefits associated with moderate whiskey consumption, however, there are also dangers associated with excessive alcohol. When you get a visual representation of the serving size for a shot of whiskey, the fine line between healthy and excessive is quite sobering. A single serving of whiskey is 30 milliliters. Each serving contains 123 calories and negligible amounts of fat, carbohydrates, sugar, sodium, fiber, or protein. While it does have high levels of polyphenol antioxidants associated with reducing \"bad\" cholesterol and triglycerides, according to a study in the , the benefits may not outweigh the potential downfalls of alcohol consumption. According to , chocolate may have some health benefits if you opt for the dark variety, which has 70 to 85% cocoa solids. Dark chocolate has antioxidant flavonols. These have been linked with improving cardiovascular health and having anti-cancer properties. But even with the dark stuff, moderation is key. A single serving of is 1 ounce or 28.35 grams. Each serving has 12.1 grams of fat, 13 grams of carbohydrates, 3.09 grams of fiber, 6.8 grams of sugar, 5.67 milligrams of sodium, and 2.21 grams of protein. Mushrooms are a low-calorie, nutrient-dense food. One cup or 96 grams of whole button mushrooms has just 21.1 calories. They also have 0.32 grams of fat, 3.13 grams of carbohydrates, 0.96 grams of fiber, 1.9 grams of sugar, 4.8 milligrams of sodium, and 2.97 grams of protein. What makes mushrooms unique is their high antioxidant levels, which include polyphenols, polysaccharides, ergothioneine, glutathione, selenium, and vitamin C, as noted in . These antioxidants may help to prevent heart disease and certain kinds of cancer. A without toppings can be highly nutritious. Potatoes contain potassium, folate, magnesium, iron, zinc, and vitamins B6 and C. They also have high amounts of essential amino acids and resistant starches, which, as noted in , may aid digestion and blood sugar regulation. While the recommended serving size for a potato is 173 grams, we were hard-pressed to find one that small. We ended up cutting a third of the potato off to obtain the proper weight. This serving size contains 161 calories, 0.2 grams of fat, 37 grams of carbohydrates, 3.8 grams of fiber, and 4.3 grams of protein. Sweet potatoes have healthy amounts of vitamins A, B6, C, potassium, calcium, and magnesium. Their orange-hued meat is also rich in the antioxidant beta-carotene, which can help boost immunity and support healthy eyes, per a review in . We had a similar issue with finding a small enough sweet potato to fit the recommended serving size of 150 grams. We ended up cutting the sweet potato in half. This serving size has 142 calories, 0.22 grams of fat, 32.7 grams of carbohydrates, 5.25 grams of fiber, 9.32 grams of sugar, 273 milligrams of sodium, and 3.16 grams of protein. If we are strictly looking at how much food you are getting for a serving, plain air-popped popcorn gives you a lot of bang for your buck. A 3-cup or 24-gram serving has just 93 calories. It also has 1.1 grams of fat, 18.6 grams of carbohydrates, 3.6 grams of fiber, 0.2 grams of sugar, 1.9 milligrams of sodium, and 3 grams of protein. Popcorn also has modest amounts of vitamins and minerals, including iron, copper, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, zinc, and assorted B vitamins. It also contains some polyphenol antioxidants, which may reduce inflammation. Mayonnaise is another food that gets a bad reputation because it is pure fat. It can, however, be a part of a well-rounded diet if consumed in moderation. In this case, serving size definitely matters. One tablespoon or 13.8 grams of regular mayonnaise has 93.8 calories. It also contains 10.3 grams of fat, 0.8 grams of carbohydrates, no fiber, 0.8 grams of sugar, 87.6 milligrams of sodium, and 0.13 grams of protein. that contain unsaturated fats are also available. Applesauce can also be a part of a healthy diet if you choose your variety carefully and look for unsweetened versions as opposed to those with sugar added. It is high in phytochemical antioxidants, which can protect you against heart disease and certain types of cancer. It is also rife with potassium, calcium, magnesium, and vitamins A, C, and B6. A single serving of apple sauce is 1 cup or 244 grams. This contains 102 calories, 0.2 grams of fat, 27.6 grams of carbohydrates, 2.68 grams of fiber, 22.9 grams of sugar, 4.88 milligrams of sodium, and 0.4 grams of protein. Most sodas are high in calories and sugar and contain little to no nutritional value, making them \"empty calories.\" While they are tasty, consuming too much can lead to a variety of health issues from dental problems to diabetes. The nutritional value of soda varies by product and brand. One 12-ounce or 355-milliliter can of Canada Dry ginger ale, for example, contains 138 calories. While this has no protein or fat, it does have 36 grams of carbohydrates, 35 grams of sugar, and 49.7 milligrams of sodium. Orange juice is another beverage that varies widely in nutritional value depending upon brand. Freshly-squeezed juice with no sugar added is always preferred. Additionally, juice with pulp is higher in fiber than that without. Orange juice can be a healthy source of calcium, folate, iron, and vitamins A and C. One cup, or 248 grams, of orange juice contains 112 calories. It also has 0.49 grams of fat, 25.8 grams of carbohydrates, 0.49 grams of fiber, 20.8 grams of sugar, 2.48 milligrams of sodium, and 1.74 grams of protein.",

Here's one more from an MSNBC foreign correspondent that has a real \"Netanyahu pounces\" kind of feel to it (video via founder Tom Elliott). Watch: MSNBC's on Hamas terror attack: \"I couldn\u2019t think of a better gift for Benjamin Netanyahu right now than this kind of incursion ... This is a very big gift for Benjamin Netanyahu.\" Sadly we can't say we're surprised. No matter how much one despises corporate media it\u2019s not nearly enough. Fact check: True. Forget politics for a second - this is insanely bad analysis. The failures leading to this war are staggering. The discontent I\u2019m seeing in Israel right now with the preparedness and response is at a boil. The idea that this is a political gift is unfathomably stupid. \"Unfathomably stupid\" pretty much sums up MSNBC. Competing for grossest take of the day I see? It's definitely in the running: When the lib media is indistinguishable from Laurence Tribe: Birds of a feather...hey , why DID you delete this? Tribe . *** Related: ***",

    "content": "The Eminence in Shadow is now back up and running on screens for Season 2 of the anime together with many of the new premieres for the Fall 2023 anime schedule , and with it has debuted the opening theme sequence for its new episodes! The Eminence in Shadow wrapped up its first season with a fairly extended amount of episodes than fans had initially expected to see it run for, and it was soon announced that the anime had plans to return for another season. Now after much waiting, the second season of the anime has kicked into high gear with attacking vampires and ghouls. The Eminence in Shadow Season 2 has kicked off a new arc where Cid Kagenou is now dealing with attacking zombies, vampires, and a dark society with the rise of a red moon , and the first episode of this new season kicked off the fights in full by teasing what to expect from the new episodes. To help celebrate the start of the new season is the debut of its opening theme titled \"Grayscale Dominator\" as performed by OxT, and you can check out the opening for The Eminence in Shadow Season 2 below. Where to Watch Eminence in Shadow Season 2 Running for 12 episodes this Fall, you can now check out The Eminence in Shadow Season 2 now streaming exclusively with HIDIVE in both Japanese audio with English subtitles and an English dubbed release . You can also catch up with everything that happened in the first season with HIDIVE as well before the second season really kicks into high gear. They tease The Eminence in Shadow as such: \"Even in his past life, Cid's dream wasn't to become a protagonist or a final boss. He'd rather lie low as a minor character until it's prime time to reveal he's a mastermind ...or at least, do the next best thing-pretend to be one! And now that he's been reborn into another world, he's ready to set the perfect conditions to live out his dreams to the fullest. Armed with his overactive imagination, Cid jokingly recruits members to his organization and makes up a whole backstory about an evil cult that they need to take down. Well, as luck would have it, these imaginary adversaries turn out to be the real deal \u2013 and everyone knows the truth but him!\" How do you like the opening for The Eminence in Shadow Season 2?

    "content": "Between Starfield , Forza Motorsport , Payday 3 , and Gotham Knights , Xbox Game Pass subscribers are quite busy. If you're one of these subscribers drowning in new additions, the last thing you need is to add another game to pile onto the backlog, but according to Xbox Game Pass subscribers over on Reddit, there's another new addition that is also \"the biggest surprise of the year.\" Echoing this, the game has been earning rave review scores over on Metacritic, currently sitting at an 89 on the review aggregator. The game in question is Cocoon . And one of the top posts calls it not just the biggest surprise of the year, but suggests it may be \"the best puzzle game\" they have ever played. Right now, the post is one of the most popular posts of the week on the page so it's clearly resonating. Meanwhile, not everyone agrees in the comments, but there are comments that echo the claim. For example, one notes that they \"don't usually play puzzles\" but are \"surprised by how much\" they are enjoying the game. For those unfamiliar with the game, it was released on September 29, 2023 by developer Geometric Interactive and publisher Annapurna Interactive. Notably, it's the product of the mind of Jeppe Carlsen, the lead gameplay designer of critical hits Inside and Limbo . \"From Jeppe Carlsen, the lead gameplay designer of Limbo and Inside - Cocoon takes you on an adventure across worlds within worlds. Master world-leaping mechanics to unravel a cosmic mystery,\" reads an official blurb about the game. The game's official pitch continues: \" Cocoon is a unique take on the puzzle adventure genre, where each world exists within an orb that you can carry on your back. Wrap your head around the core mechanic of leaping between worlds-and combine, manipulate, and rearrange them to solve intricate puzzles.\" If you do opt to check out Cocoon as a result of its glowing critical reviews and praise from Xbox Game Pass subscribers, you'll get a game that is roughly four to five hours long. Unfortunately, it does not offer much replayability. In other words, you're not going to get much more out of the game than these four to five hours. 0 comments Related: New Xbox Game Pass Deal Gives You a Free Subscription Xbox Series X Players Surprised With New Freebie Highly-Anticipated Game Will Have a Major Downgrade on Xbox Series S New Xbox Deal Gets You Starfield for Free One of the Best Xbox RPGs Is on Sale for $2.99",

We\u2019ve also written up one or two controllers, but we don\u2019t think we\u2019ve ever seen anything like this \u2014 . The guitar in question is a Schecter Hellraiser Deluxe, which seems like a great choice to us. In order to get the notes to control the game, [DOS Storm] converted a handful of notes to MIDI using a VST plugin called Dodo MIDI 2 and the Reaper DAW. Then it was a matter of converting MIDI to keystrokes. This took two programs \u2014 loopMIDI to do take the MIDI data and route it elsewhere, and MIDIKey2Key to actually convert the MIDI to the keystrokes that control DOOM. The result is that the notes that move Doomguy around are mostly in an A-major bar chord formation, with some controls up in the solo range of the fret board. Be sure to check out the demo video below and watch [DOS Storm] clear level one in a fairly impressive amount of time, considering their controller is a guitar. That isn\u2019t even the most ridiculous thing we\u2019ve seen DOOM running on. It\u2019s probably a toss-up between that and . Via",

The upcoming season will see a lot of returning favorites in front of and behind the camera in addition to some exciting newcomers. Dan Trachtenberg , who is best known for helming Prey and 10 Cloverfield Lane , is set to direct an episode of Season 5. Trachtenberg recently spoke to Collider about Stranger Things , and teased it is going to be \"awesome.\" \"I was prepping it before the strike and doing previews for sequences and stuff,\" Trachtenberg explained. \"It's awesome! I'm doing it because I love that show so much. I think every season has gotten better and better and better, and this is the final one, and the Duffers are geniuses and good, really good dudes. And this episode, that's just 'an episode' of Season 5, has several awesome set pieces in it and it's gonna be huge, man. It's a big season, and, so far, so cool.\" Trachtenberg's involvement with Stranger Things was announced back in June. \"Get ready to head back to Hawkins, Indiana. Season 5 of Stranger Things is inching closer, and a new member is joining the Party -- 10 Cloverfield Lane director Dan Trachtenberg will direct an episode of the show's upcoming final season,\" Netflix previously announced. \"There's no word yet on which episode the director will helm, but he's an eminently qualified set of hands.\" How Will Stranger Things End? Stranger Things creators, Matt Duffer and Ross Duffer, recently revealed that their pitch for the fifth season was a tear-jerker. \"Listen. It's our process but it's just like, we really just try to focus on one season at a time,\" Ross Duffer previously told The Wrap . \"We do have an outline for season 5 and we pitched it to Netflix and they really responded well to it. I mean, it was hard. It's the end of the story. I saw executives crying who I've never seen cry before and it was wild. And it's not just to do with the story, just the fact that it's like, Oh my God, this thing that has defined so many of our lives, these Netflix people who has been with us from the beginning, seven years now, and it's hard to imagine the journey coming to an end.\" Stranger Things is expected to return for its final season in 2024. 0 comments Related: Stranger Things Season 5 Reveals Surprising First Look Stranger Things Gets a New Wave of Funko Pops Ahead Of The Final Season Stranger Things Star Robert Englund Addresses a Season 5 Return Stranger Things' Millie Bobby Brown Wrote a Novel, Already Planning Movie Adaptation",

This afternoon President Biden delivered remarks revolving around what happened after he woke up this morning: BIDEN: \"When I got up this morning and started this at 7:30, 8:00, my calls...\" Was that his first briefing on the attacks, which started at approx. 11:30 p.m. ET and continued throughout the night? \"Was that his first briefing on the attacks, which started at approx. 11:30 p.m. ET and continued throughout the night?\" This is a fair question to ask Maybe somebody can ask KJP about it Monday (she'll lie of course but it's worth a try). Nobody woke the president to let him know that one of our staunchest allies was under attack We have questions too, as do many others: Is it White House policy to not wake the President up while one of our strongest allies is being attacked? Even if you believe he was awake at 7:30am and taking calls, that\u2019s nearly a full *8 hours* after war broke out without any comment from him. Biden couldn\u2019t be bothered to deal with Israel for a solid 12 hours Why does he sound proud of this? Our nation\u2019s greatest ally in the Middle East was under terrorist attack and Joe\u2019s bedtime couldn\u2019t be interrupted. Disgraceful. I was up all night keeping up on the facts.

    "description": "Check out the ComicBook team's big questions and predictions for WWE Fastlane 2023!",
    "content": "WWE is hosting Fastlane in Indianapolis tonight, and while the card is only five matches deep, the potential for a night of big action and surprise is still high . Three matches of the five will have Championship gold on the line, including the WWE World Heavyweight Championship, the WWE Women's Championship, and the Undisputed WWE Tag Team Championships. While there's no Title up for grabs in John Cena and LA Knight's match against The Bloodline, there is big potential to move some stories forward for Cena and Knight especially. Then there's the biggest surprise element in Jade Cargill, who is expected to make her WWE debut during the Premium Live Event. The ComicBook team has put together all their predictions and biggest questions heading into Fastlane, and you can find those on the next slide. It's not known how he will make that debut or if she will actually appear on TV, but Cargill is reportedly in Indianapolis today, so it would be odd for her not to make some kind of appearance during Fastlane. There's always the tried and true method of having Cargill appear in the crowd so they can introduce her and have the commentary team talk about her, but she could also get involved in the match between IYO SKY, Asuka, and Charlotte Flair. Cargill is expected to be featured on Monday Night Raw moving forward, so if she makes her quick debut here, WWE can then move forward and start putting her over when she appears on Raw. As for her first in-ring opponent, that remains to be seen, but there are several compelling options depending on which way WWE wants to go. You can find our predictions on the next slide. Fastlane Card and Updated Results: World Heavyweight Championship Last Man Standing Match: Seth \"Freakin\" Rollins (C) vs. Shinsuke Nakamura WWE Women's Championship Match: IYO SKY (C) vs. Charlotte Flair vs. Asuka Undisputed WWE Tag Team Championship Match: Finn B\u00e1lor & Damian Priest (C) vs. Cody Rhodes & Jey Uso John Cena and LA Knight vs. Jimmy Uso & Solo Sikoa Six-Man Tag Team Match: The LWO vs. Bobby Lashley & The Street Profits Check out all of our predictions and questions for WWE Fastlane on the next slide. You can also talk all things wrestling with me on Threads @mattaguilarcb! Do We Get LA Knight vs. John Cena After WWE Fastlane? Matthew Aguilar: Ever since LA Knight started interacting with Cena on TV, WWE has been planting the seeds for a match between the two superstars. Whether Cena and Knight take down Jimmy and Solo remains to be seen, but even if they do, you could see something happening that would lead to a match between Cena and Knight, an encounter that Cena should ultimately lose to push Knight even further to the moon. The only challenge is to get the match off the ground without pushing Knight into heel territory, but I'm certain they can manage. Liam Crowley: I could see this going down at WWE Crown Jewel if Cena is working that event. Knight is wildly popular in Saudi Arabia and giving him a victory over the biggest star in the company in front of that crowd would be huge. Charlie Ridgely: It's gonna happen at some point, right? There's too much potential here to not act on it. For me, it's more of a when than if. It feels like a WrestleMania match but Cena's current run isn't going to last into the spring. Survivor Series doesn't quite feel big enough? Royal Rumble seems like the best bet, and that will give them plenty of time to fall out and develop a good feud. Nick Valdez: It's either that or be fed to Roman Reigns, and it's way too early for something like that. It's the best move to get LA Knight away from the Bloodline because that's just something he's not really ready for yet. The crowd is feeling him and the hype is there, but there's no way LA Knight can stand toe to toe with the actual top of the card and come out the same. A John Cena win seems the best bet. Evan Valentine : We'd better! This almost seems like an even that could be a \"passing of the torch\" from Cena to Knight and John hasn't been afraid to do what it takes to \"push over\" up and comers in the organization. I doubt that this match will be set to the side until the next WrestleMania so maybe we'll see it arrive at Survivor Series? Tim Adams: We may see some more team-ups between John Cena and LA Knight that eventually leads to a one-on-one confrontation between them. Knight would get a tremendous rub by pinning Cena in the ring, as a \"passing the torch\" moment. prev next Is There Any Way Rollins Loses to Nakamura? If Not, When Does Rollins Actually Lose the Title? MA : If this were anything but Fastlane, I'd say yes, but I just don't see Rollins losing the World Heavyweight Championship to Nakamura at a PLE that isn't one of the big four. That doesn't mean it can't happen, but it's just less likely. That said, I'd love to see Nakamura get a run with the Title before he's done with WWE. LC: Yes. Time to crown Nakamura. Lengthy reigns are getting overdone, I want to see this title get hot potatoed a bit. CR: It would be awesome to see Nakamura strapped up, especially with his current heel character, but it doesn't like the right loss for Seth. I'm still leaning towards Priest cashing in and taking it from Rollins. If Judgement Day drop the Undisputed Tag Team Championships to Cody Rhodes and Jey Uso on Saturday, I wouldn't be surprised to see Priest cash in his briefcase later that same night. He'd keep gold and stay on good terms with Rhea Ripley, which would drive him and Finn Balor even further apart. NV: Rollins needs to lose this already. If the World Heavyweight Championship is supposed to be the worker's title (that isn't the IC) then Rollins could stand to lose it. Don't know why we broke off from Roman if the title was just going to have as long of a reign with someone else. Might as well let Nakamura play around with it for a bit and see where it could lead. Now's the time for some experimentation before we're locked in for WrestleMania. EV : Honestly, I'd prefer it if Nakamura was to win this one but I can't see it happening now. Rollins needs more time as the Heavy Weight Champion and truth be told, I don't foresee this particular Pay-Per-View as being the one to see the \"Monday Night Messiah\" lose his gold. Shinsuke might be better set for an Intercontinental run but Gunther still has that belt on lock. TA: Seth Rollins keeps his title until he re-ignites his feud with Cody Rhodes, who is still searching for his first World Heavyweight Championship in WWE. And once again, Cody will come out victorious. Nakamura is just to keep Rollins occupied until WWE is ready for Rollins vs. Rhodes again, most likely at WrestleMania. prev next Do We Get Cody Rhodes Traded to SmackDown After WWE Fastlane? Is That His Big Reveal on NXT? MA: My fingers are double and triple crossed for this to happen, and other than becoming an actual full-time Tag Team with Jey Uso (which doesn't seem likely) there's not much else for him to do on Monday Night Raw. Heading to SmackDown can obviously fire back up the Bloodline storyline, but it also gives him a fresh batch of superstars to work with as he makes his way down that path. As the person who covers SmackDown here, I'm aware I'm bias to wanting this to happen, but whatever, because I still want it to happen. LC: No, the trade return for Jey will be Jade Cargill. CR: I want to see he and Jey tell a story together for a little while, so I hope he sticks around RAW a bit longer. I think his big announcement is that he's \"coaching\" team NXT for Survivor Series. NV: His big reveal is going to be another Dusty Rhodes Tag Team Classic. EV : I could definitely see this happening. I think the more chaos and unexpected events thrown at the \"American Nightmare\" will work well to set up his eventual re-match, and hopeful victory, against Roman Reigns. TA: With SmackDown currently heading to USA Network and the future of Raw up in the air, it seems very likely. SmackDown is set to be the premier program that WWE will put a lot of its focus on, which means its biggest stars need to be on it. But who could Cody even be traded for, without completing gutting Raw? prev next Book the Ending of the WWE Women's Championship Match: Will SKY's Reign End at WWE Fastlane? MA: I'm going to say that Charlotte Flair gets under Bayley's skin with more of her \"who you used to be\" taunts, and Bayley sees an opportunity to cost SKY the match and have Asuka win. It doesn't work though, and SKY ultimately retains with Dakota Kai's help, and this could be one of the bigger nails in the coffin for Damage CTRL. LC: It shouldn't. WWE has yet to give a meaningful reign to a Ms. Money in the Bank cash-in, and IYO SKY should hold the title for a while to end that stigma. Right now, she still feels like a midcard performer because Bayley is overshadowing her. This reign should not end until she establishes herself as a singles star on her own. CR: This match is really about Damage CTRL, so Bayley will be at the center of whatever happens. She'll do something that appears to cost SKY the match, but Iyo will pull through and retain in spite of her mentor. NV: Yeah this is totally the step one of something for Io and Bayley down the line. Bayley will get in the way somehow, but Io will still prevail. Eventually it's going to be Io vs. Bayley for the title, and that'll be the big bucks. EV : I definitely foresee this match being, at the very least, the building blocks for the destruction of Damage CTRL, if not the team dissolving as a result of Fastlane. I think SKY retains her championship but I can foresee her next big match being up against Bayley for the next Pay-Per-View event later this fall. TA: Not in a Triple Threat match. Let SKY continue to run with the title some more, until the inevitable implosion of Damage CTRL. prev next If Jade Cargill Debuts at WWE Fastlane, Who Do You Want to See Her Face First? MA : Since reports put her on Monday Night Raw, I'll go with the red brand's roster. Unfortunately, Raw's Women's Division is a little banged up right now or otherwise occupied. Natalya is probably one of the best first opponents for Cargill, as she can absorb a loss but still make a match competitive. Plus, she is fantastic at making others look great, and no doubt WWE will want to make their new star shine as brightly as possible. As for who I want her to face, Jade and Liv Morgan would probably be fantastic sparring partners, but Morgan is currently hurt at the moment. LC: Beats Charlotte Flair clean a la Kevin Owens debut victory over John Cena in 2015. CR: I really want to see Jade start at NXT and feud with Becky Lynch, but she isn't going to get strapped up right away and losing in her debut isn't a great option either. If we're sticking to the RAW roster, Natalya makes the most sense. Then again, I'm not going to rule out Trish Stratus coming in to really put Jade over. NV: I hope it's more like she's just going to be in the crowd at Fastlane more so than actually getting in the ring. But with the roll out she's getting she'll be in the mix sooner rather than later. I was personally hoping for a Royal Rumble debut and win, to then challenge Rhea. But I could see her coming out and confronting Rhea either way. Somehow. EV : That's a tough one and a good question. I think you want to have her defeat a pretty big name but not have her outright win a belt in her opening salvo. I also don't necessarily foresee her taking on someone like Asuka or Charlotte Flair since they're otherwise occupied. Becky Lynch maybe? TA: Seeing Jade tangle with Damage CTRL wouldn't be a bad way to introduce her to the main roster. The advantage of this is it allows for several one-on-one matches, as well as tag team matches and six-women tags. This allows Jade to get in the ring with several different women in WWE's women division, such as Charlotte Flair, Asuka, and of course, Bianca Belair. prev next Name One NXT Superstar You Want Called Up After Fastlane. MA : Referring to the aforementioned ailing Raw Women's Division, they could use a boost, but I don't think NXT moves Tiffany Stratton up just yet. With that option on halt at the moment, I would say it's time for Bron Breakker. There's literally nothing else for him to do in NXT, so much so that he's facing Melo one more time after a years-long rivalry. Bron is ready and will instantly give Raw's roster another violent heel to deal with, and this is actually one of the only feuds I'd actually want to see Cody Rhodes stick around on Raw for. Also, Bron's spear is better than anyone else's in WWE at the moment, even Roman's. Not part of the question, but just a statement of fact haha. LC: Brooks Jensen. CR: Matt is right about the RAW Women's Division right now. It could use a boost and I'd love to see that boost come in the form of Wendy Choo. She's been recovering from injury but everything I saw from her prior to going out was more than good enough for the Main Roster. NV: In terms of stories they have rolling right now, Dragon Lee's pretty much been called up already. But I can see Trick and Melo coming up to help against Judgment Day during Survivor Series. But part of me hopes Roxanne Perez getting the Asuka test is the final real shot of whether or not she's ready. EV : In my heart of hearts, I wouldn't mind seeing Boa making the jump from NXT to the \"big leagues\". I'm a sucker for more of the \"mystique\" when it comes to professional wrestling, and Boa's make-up-laden aesthetic might work well as an addition to the men's roster. To say nothing of his technical prowess in the ring. TA: Bron Breakker. Feuds with the likes of Baron Corbin are just the appetizer to what Breakker can do on the main roster, be it Raw or SmackDown. With some of the recent releases, there's room for a young hungry superstar to make a name for themselves, and now is Bron Breakker's moment. prev next Book Two Matches for Survivor Series. MA : I'm going to pump up my own prediction and say LA Knight vs John Cena, and then I'll go with Bayley vs IYO SKY. Probs going to be wrong on both haha, but I'm committed! LC: CM Punk vs. Seth Rollins. CR: Damian Priest defending the World Heavyweight Championship against Finn Balor. Survivor Series may be too soon but I want to make sure to put the prediction in writing so I can say I'm right whenever it happens. And just a shot in the dark, I'm going with Gunther vs. Bronson Reed for the Intercontinental Championship. Not sure how they build to it but I don't care, I just want to see it. NV: Judgment Day and JD McDonagh vs. Cody, Jey, KO and Sami, and LA Knight vs. John Cena was a good idea. EV : Bayley vs SKY seems like a gimme at this point, all the signs are certainly there for it. I might also see a solo match between Cody Rhodes and Finn Balor taking place as the American Nightmare keeps working his way to his big Reigns rematch. TA: The Bloodline and Nakamura vs. Seth Rollins, Cody Rhodes, Jey Uso, and John Cena. Damage CTRL and Rhea Ripley vs. Charlotte Flair, Asuka, Bianca Belair, and Jade Cargill. prev next Fastlane Card Predictions MA : Jimmy Uso & Solo Sikoa def.

    "description": "Newsom's veto came amid a West Coast movement to decriminalize the fungus-drug popularly known as \"shrooms,\" along with other plant- and fungus-based psychedelics.",
    "content": "Gov. Gavin Newsom on Saturday vetoed a bill that would have removed criminal penalties for using and possessing small amounts of hallucinogens, including psilocybin \u201cmagic\u201d mushrooms and the cactus-derived drug mescaline. The bill, which would also have decriminalized the psilocybin mushroom extract psilocin and the psychoactive compound dimethyltryptamine, or DMT, would have eliminated criminal penalties for using specific quantities of the drugs for people 21 and older. \u201cBoth peer-reviewed science and powerful personal anecdotes lead me to support new opportunities to address mental health through psychedelic medicines like those addressed in this bill,\u201d Newsom wrote , who three weeks ago passed the bill, SB 58. \u201cPsychedelics have proven to relieve people suffering from certain conditions such as depression, PTSD, traumatic brain injury, and other addictive personality traits.\u201d Newsom promised California would lead on addressing mental health through psychedelic drugs. But he wrote that he could not sign the bill without regulated \u201ctreatment guidelines\u201d on dosing information and therapeutic use, along with \u201crules to prevent against exploitation during guided treatments,\u201d and a medical-clearance process to check for \u201cunderlying psychoses.\u201d Newsom urged lawmakers to send him a bill next year with such guidelines. And the governor left the door open for wider permitted uses of the substances. Newsom said he was \u201ccommitted to working with the legislature and sponsors of this bill to craft legislation that would authorize permissible uses and consider a framework for potential broader decriminalization in the future, once the impacts, dosing, best practice, and safety guardrails are thoroughly contemplated and put in place.\u201d State Sen. Scott Wiener, who put forward the bill, to call Newsom\u2019s veto \u201ca setback for the huge number of Californians \u2014 including combat veterans and first responders \u2014 who are safely using and benefiting from these non-addictive substances and who will now continue to be classified as criminals under California law.\u201d Wiener promised to be \u201cback with legislation next year.\u201d The plant-based drugs at issue in the bill remain illegal under federal law. But Newsom\u2019s veto came amid a movement to decriminalize and even legalize the fungus-drug popularly known as \u201cshrooms,\u201d along with other plant- and fungus-based psychedelics. UC Berkeley researchers indicating 61% of registered voters in the U.S. support legalizing regulated therapeutic access to psychedelics. Oakland\u2019s city council in 2019 passed a resolution decriminalizing consciousness-altering plants including psilocybin mushrooms, following shortly on the heels of Denver, the first city in the U.S. to decriminalize psilocybin, via a ballot measure. In early 2020, the city council in Santa Cruz voted unanimously in favor of a resolution similar to Oakland\u2019s. Colorado voters followed suit with approval of a state-wide ballot measure last year, and Oregon, following a 2021 ballot measure, this year became the first state to legalize psilocybin use by adults. After criminal penalties were dropped in Oakland, the \u201cChurch of Ambrosia\u201d began selling mushrooms on site to members, who can apply for membership online. The \u201cchurch\u201d has expanded to San Francisco. Another San Francisco psilocybin purveyor, The Living Church, takes donations for \u201csacred mushroom\u201d varieties described on the shop\u2019s Instagram page as including the \u201cfriendly, giggly, and gentle\u201d Hillbilly, the Monster Mac for \u201cintense visuals, pure euphoria, time dilation fading into introspection\u201d and Enigma, a \u201cpeculiar blob mutation\u201d that produces a \u201cvery transformative expierience (sic), vivid visuals, and introspective complentation (sic).\u201d Retired Santa Clara County firefighter Angela Graham founded the S.I.R.E.N. Project, which pays for with mental health issues. The 21st Century\u2019s psychedelic movement has received boosts from celebrities including boxer Mike Tyson, who that psilocybin mushrooms freed him from mental distress and suicidal thoughts. Prince Harry, the English Duke of Sussex, wrote in that taking the mushrooms helped him \u201credefine\u201d reality and cope with grief and trauma from the 1997 death of his mother, Princess Diana, when he was 12. More locally, former Specialized Bicycles CEO , a foundation dedicated to researching and promoting psychedelic treatments for addiction and trauma. The U.S. National Institute on Drug Abuse recognizes \u201cgrowing research interest\u201d in psychedelic drugs for treating mental health disorders. But the institute also warns of side effects and said data from 2000 to 2016 show the most common short-term effects reported by by poison-control hotline callers about taking psilocybin or the chemical hallucinogen LSD were agitation, rapid heartbeat, pupil dilation, confusion, and vomiting. Other potential adverse reactions include fear and anxiety, according to the institute. \u201cThese challenging experiences are also known as having a \u2018bad trip,'\u201d the institute noted. Newsom\u2019s reference in the letter to exploitation during guided treatments appears to reflect caution over what researchers in called \u201creported instances of sexual abuse perpetrated by shamans or guides in psychedelic contexts.\u201d The decriminalization bill was opposed by a Marin County-based group calling itself the California Coalition for Psychedelic Safety and Education. Lisa Hudson, a member of the organization, this year that she lost her 16-year-old son Shayne Rebbetoy in 2020 after he took mushrooms, though he could fly, and leapt from the family\u2019s 40-foot-tall deck in San Anselmo.",

    "description": "Replacing former UVA star Brennan Armstrong, MJ Morris throws a career-best four touchdown passes for the Wolfpack.",
    "content": "In his first start of the season, MJ Morris threw a career-best four touchdown passes as North Carolina State topped Marshall 48-41 Saturday afternoon in Raleigh. Morris, a sophomore, completed 17 of 32 passes for 265 yards. He threw three interceptions \u2013 including two in the first quarter \u2013 but settled into the game and put N.C. State (4-2) into a position to win. He got the starting job when former Virginia star Brennan Armstrong was benched after the previous week\u2019s loss to Louisville. Marshall (4-1) saw its nine-game win streak that dated to last season snapped. Cam Fancher led the Thundering Herd with a season-high 315 passing yards and four touchdowns \u2013 two passing and two rushing. The clash was a fast-paced shootout that featured six lead changes. When the dust settled, it was the highest scoring game either team had been a part of all season. Quarterback Thomas Castellanos ran for his fourth touchdown of the game with 25 seconds left to give the Eagles (3-3) a victory over Army (2-3) in West Point, New York. Castellanos rushed for 142 yards and powered the Eagles to an early lead with his three earlier scores, and the last brought them back after Army had controlled much of the second half. After Boston College was stopped on two attempts from inside the 3, Castellanos kept the ball on third down and ran to his right for the go-ahead score. Castellanos had earlier rushed for TDs of 20, 4 and 10 yards. BC has won two straight for the first time since 2021. Bryson Daily ran for 99 yards and threw a touchdown pass for Army. The Tar Heels (5-0, 2-0 ACC) breezed past the Orange (4-2, 0-2) in Chapel Hill as Drake Maye threw for three touchdowns and ran for another. The Tar Heels barely gave the Orange any chances because of a ball-control offense that churned out 644 yards and about twice as much time of possession. Receiver Tez Walker made his UNC debut two days after he was cleared to play by the NCAA following a long transfer-eligibility case. Syracuse had 221 yards of total offense in its second straight loss. Quarterback Garrett Shrader was 15 for 21 for 124 yards and an interception. The host Tigers (4-2, 2-2 ACC) overcame the Demon Deacons (3-2, 0-2). Cade Klubnik and Will Shipley ran for touchdowns, and Clemson\u2019s defense held Wake Forest in check throughout a victory that gave Tigers coach Dabo Swinney a program-record-tying 165th win. Clemson won its 15th straight over Wake Forest despite its offense putting up a season-low 307 yards. Swinney tied the mark of the late Frank Howard, who was Clemson\u2019s coach from 1940-69. The Tigers have a week off before Swinney gets his first chance to move in front when they face No. 17 Miami on Oct. 21. Clemson\u2019s defense showed out strong with a goal line stand in the first half after Wake Forest recovered a fumble at the Tigers\u2019 9. The Demon Deacons had just 239 yards. Shipley\u2019s 1-yard touchdown run with 5:49 to play made things more comfortable. But the Tigers will have to show much more on offense if they hope to escape South Florida with a win in a couple of weeks. Clemson lost two fumbles and missed a field goal.",

    "content": "FTR have been AEW World Tag Team Champions for over six months. The duo of Dax Harwood and Cash Wheeler captured the gold by defeating The Gunns on an April episode of AEW Dynamite where they put their AEW careers on the line. That ultimatum mirrored real life, as Harwood and Wheeler had made it abundantly clear that their AEW contracts were expiring that month. Since becoming champions, Harwood and Wheeler announced that they had each inked four-year extensions with AEW and confirmed that those deals will be their last, as they plan to retire alongside one another come 2027. During this AEW Tag Title reign, FTR have had high-profile defenses against the likes of MJF and Adam Cole, Aussie Open, and Bullet Club Gold. They reignited their rivalry with the Young Bucks at AEW ALL IN: London , ending with another successful defense and a 2-1 edge against the Jackson brothers in their all-time duos bouts. After the Bucks won a No.1 Contenders' Match at AEW WrestleDream , many expected this to lead to a fourth match between the two teams. FTR Lose AEW World Tag Team Championships That fourth match with the Young Bucks is on indefinite pause. Ricky Starks and Big Bill shockingly upset FTR to become the new AEW World Tag Team Champions on tonight's AEW Collision . Starks and Bill were able to isolate Dax Harwood and take advantage of a largely 2-on-1 contest, leading to the victory. You can see highlights from the match below... Big Bill just put Cash Wheeler through the announcer's table on the outside!

Tonight's surprising loss led to speculation that FTR could be on their way out of AEW. Dax Harwood sparked rumors when he recently filed to trademark \"CMFTR,\" the trios name of CM Punk and FTR that the three men used on AEW Collision throughout the summer. Punk was fired from AEW last month. While the reason for the trademark remains unknown, FTR losing their titles tonight likely comes down to both men being banged up. Cash Wheeler was hurt during FTR's AEW WrestleDream defense against Aussie Open and was written out of most of tonight's match after he was put through the announce table.

    "content": "By The Patriots reportedly have high hopes that their highest-paid defensive player could return to play before the end of this year. , Matthew Judon, who suffered a torn lower bicep tendon last week, could be back on the field in about two months. Rapoport added that the timetable could be based on how well the 31-year-old\u2019s elected went. He said December is a \u201crealistic goal\u201d for Judon\u2019s return. Judon suffered the injury against the Dallas Cowboys in Texas on Oct. 1. that the linebacker would be out \u2018indefinitely\u2019 alongside rookie cornerback Christian Gonzalez, who suffered a dislocated shoulder also versus the Cowboys. Matt Judon, who underwent surgery to repair a torn biceps tendon, has not yet been placed on IR. Regardless, based on how the surgery went, there is a good chance he's back before the end of the year. December appears to be a realistic goal. ahead of Sunday\u2019s game against the New Orleans Saints; however, notably, Judon did not. The lack of a roster move on Judon\u2019s part could be a good sign, for the time being, that New England has optimism that the player can return in 2023. Judon, who signed with the Patriots as a free agent in 2021, recorded four sacks this year before his injury. He logged 13 tackles in three games, 10 of those being solo. He had a remarkable 2022 season upon recording a career-high 15.5 sacks, 28 quarterback hits, and 60 tackles last season. Those numbers helped him land a revised two-year contract extension worth $22.5 million with New England this past offseason. Patriots\u2019 head coach Bill Belichick was questioned after the Cowboys game for still having one of his best players in Judon on the field while New England was being blown out. Judon\u2019s injury occurred early in the fourth quarter while the team was down by 28 points. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to put somebody out there,\u201d . The Patriots have a number of other linebackers on the roster who will need to step up in Judon\u2019s absence.

    "description": "The Pirates scored 13 unanswered points in a fourth-quarter comeback that ultimately fell short.",
    "content": "HAMPTON \u2014 Hampton University\u2019s brief football win streak came to an end Saturday with a 30-27 loss to Campbell at Armstrong Stadium. The Pirates slipped to 4-2 on the season and 1-1 in Coastal Athletic Association play. Coach Robert Prunty and the Pirates were never out of the game and nearly pulled off a comeback. After going down 30-14 early in the fourth quarter, Hampton scored 13 unanswered points late to pull make it a three-point game. \u201cIt says a lot that we don\u2019t quit, we keep fighting,\u201d Prunty said. \u201cI tell the guys that it\u2019s coming down just to staying mentally tough. I\u2019m really proud of this football team and the way they\u2019re working. They gotta get it done. \u2026 Just got to finish and we got to eliminate turnovers.\u201d Unfortunately for the Pirates, an onside kick with just less than a minute left was unsuccessful and Campbell iced the game. \u201cWe had two chances, it just didn\u2019t go our way,\u201d Prunty said. \u201c\u2026 Like I told the players, sometimes the ball don\u2019t bounce your way. I\u2019ve been here long enough to see that. It just didn\u2019t bounce our way today.\u201d Hampton\u2019s defense was able to put a rare blemish on Campbell quarterback Hajj-Malik Williams\u2019 stat line early in the game. Omar Ibrahim intercepted Williams on Campbell\u2019s first drive of the game. The pick was Williams\u2019 third of the year. Hampton\u2019s initial drive seemed to be stalling, but a roughing-the-passer penalty on the Camels on third down bailed the Pirates out. Two plays later, Elijah Burris scampered for a 45-yard touchdown run to give Hampton a 7-0 lead. Burris finished the game with 113 yards and an average of 7.5 yards per carry. The Pirates\u2019 remaining two first-quarter drives went nowhere. HU went three-and-out twice for a combination of minus-12 yards. The latter of those two drives ended with Tristian Heaton punting from the back of the end zone and into a strong wind, resulting in Campbell taking over in Pirates territory. Campbell took advantage of both three-and-outs, scoring on its next two drives and going up 14-7. Former Portsmouth Christian star NaQuari Rogers was responsible for the first score on a 2-yard touchdown run, and Williams found Ezeriah Anderson on a 7-yard touchdown pass for the second score. Hampton only had one drive in the second quarter and, for a moment, it appeared it might get on the board. The Pirates drove into the red zone, but turned the ball over after a quarterback keeper by Christopher Zellous came up short on fourth down. The ensuing Campbell drive took up all but two seconds of the remaining 7:46 left before halftime. The Camels drove 80 yards to the goal line, but the Pirates\u2019 defense stood tall, halting Rogers and getting a goal-line stand to keep the score at 14-7 going into the half. \u201cAt that point in the game, it was a huge momentum-changer,\u201d HU linebacker Qwahsin Townsel said. \u201cWhen we get down in the red zone, I just keep telling my guys, \u2018threes not sevens, threes not sevens,\u2019 and they tried to take a chance on fourth down, we made the stop and got them off the field. It felt good in the moment, for sure.\u201d Townsel was one of several Pirates who got in on the stop. He led Hampton with a career-high 17 tackles. \u201cI just kept trying to fly to the ball,\u201d Townsel. \u201cMy goal is to get the guy with the ball, so I just was out there trying to play hard and be the best I can for my team. The chips will fall where they may.\u201d Hampton started the scoring in the second half when Zellous found a diving Evan King for a 22-yard touchdown pass that tied it at 14. The next drive, Campbell had to settle for a field-goal attempt after a successful fourth-down conversion was brought back by a false-start penalty. Caleb Dowden\u2019s 54-yard attempt came up short, giving the Pirates the ball in good field position. Unfortunately for the Pirates, another errant throw by Zellous was picked off. The interception set up a touchdown by Campbell and extended the Camels\u2019 lead to 21-14. Hampton\u2019s next drive didn\u2019t go any better, as a snap on fourth down sailed over Heaton\u2019s head and resulted in a safety and a 23-14 Campbell lead. The Camels quickly added more after a 7-yard touchdown run from Chris McKay made it 30-14. McKay finished with 97 rushing yards. Darran Butts called his own number for the Pirates on the next drive. Butts zipped through the Camels\u2019 defense for a 47-yard run and, two plays later, he found the end zone on a 4-yard run to make it a 30-20 game. Butts finished with 124 yards on the ground. Another missed field goal by Dowden, this time from 38 yards, gave Hampton the ball back, but a few plays later, Zellous threw his second interception. After the pick, the game seemingly was Campbell\u2019s to lose, but Hampton\u2019s defense once again stood strong. The Pirates forced the Camels to punt after a three-and-out, giving the ball back to Zellous and the offense with just more than three minutes to go. Zellous led a 78-yard scoring drive, 71 yards of which came on the ground, and capped it with a 17-yard touchdown pass to Jaden Wimberly that made it 30-27. Zellous finished 14 for 28 with 147 yards and two touchdowns, with two interceptions. \u201cWhat happens here is it gives us an idea of what level that we can play at,\u201d Prunty said. \u201cWe just need to be consistent playing there and finish. I think if we get there, we\u2019ll have a better grasp of this team. We\u2019re learning, but we got to continue to get better.\u201d",

    "description": "One of the key features for Messages in iOS 16, macOS Ventura, and newer versions is the ability to unsend and edit iMessages. Here's how to do it.",
    "content": "Typos and other errors are pretty common during our everyday texting sessions. For a very long time, though, iMessage users had no way to amend these mistakes. That was until iOS 16 and macOS Ventura debuted in 2022, along with the ability to edit or unsend iMessages. Whether you're on , , , or their 2022 predecessors, all you have to do is follow the steps we've listed below. Prerequisites First of all, there are some limitations. Obviously, you won't be able to edit or unsend SMS messages, which are the ones that show up in green bubbles. Another key limitation is that you can unsend or edit an iMessage for a period of time, but if the recipient is running an older version of iOS, iPadOS, or macOS, they'll still see the original message. The Messages app is going to warn you of this. It will tell you that the message has been unsent or edited, and that the recipient may still see it because they're running an older version of iOS (yes, it still calls out iOS specifically even if you're using macOS). The same goes for group texts, as the app will specifically mention the people in the group who are running the older version. Additionally, you have no more than 2 minutes to unsend and 15 minutes to edit a message. And do note that the recipient will still be able to see your edit history anyway. Finally, early builds of watchOS 9 didn't support editing or unsending iMessages. While it's unclear when this feature was implemented exactly, and later versions now support it. So you can fix these errors right from your wrist if you're up to date. How to unsend or edit an iMessage The method of unsending or editing a message is pretty straightforward across , iPads, Apple Watches, and Macs. Long-press on an you sent on iOS, iPadOS, or watchOS, or + on the message if you're using macOS. Select or . A message will pop up informing you that some recipients might still be able to see unsent messages. If you're editing, adjust the message as needed and hit the . Do note that your message will then have an label under it, and recipients will be able to view the edit history. That's it. The message will either be unsent or changed based on what you just did, assuming that the recipient is on iOS 16, iPadOS 16, macOS Ventura, and/or a newer OS version. This makes iMessage a more practical instant messaging service for those who don't always proofread or double-check their messages when texting. After all, accidents happen, and knowing that there is an undo button available encourages people to adopt the platform instead of relying on a third-party alternative.",

    "content": "It\u2019s official: Husband and wife Jay Krymis and Michel Verdi of Padre and Mezcalero have acquired the shuttered Lupe\u2019s De La Mar space at 301 The Promenade North. Lupe\u2019s closed its doors at the start of the year before its neighbor Portuguese Bend Distilling followed suit. This takeover comes after news that the Padre/Mezcalero building at 525 E. Broadway will eventually be demolished to make way for a residential development. However, this doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that Padre and Mezcalero will deputize Lupe\u2019s. Instead, Krymis and Verdi, who formerly ran WeHo\u2019s FUBAR and presently operate Schmitty\u2019s in the same neighborhood, are debating whether or not to maintain Padre\u2019s presence in Long Beach or debut a from-scratch concept. Per Brian Addison\u2019s , Krymis explains, \u201cMe and the team are kinda divided on what we plan on doing\u2026Padre is a strong name in Long Beach and it would make sense for us to simply move it for brand recognition. But the space at Lupe\u2019s itself is entirely different and we definitely want to alter the feel\u2026 We want the space to feel a bit more lived-in, a bit more warm, a bit more casual.\u201d For the F&B duo, this means bringing to the somewhat desolate Downtown area a place \u201cthat has pitchers, that has shareables, that has an extensive happy hour \u2014 that\u2019s a hangout more than an elevated space that is held off for special occasions.\u201d Whatever the space becomes, it will be here by the end of the year and we\u2019ll be eagerly waiting.

    "content": "Forbes Business SportsMoney WWE Fastlane 2023 Results: Winners And Grades As Jade Cargill Appears Alfred Konuwa Contributor Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own. I write about men in tights and the money they make for men in suits. Following Oct 7, 2023, 10:52pm EDT | Press play to listen to this article! Got it! Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Seth Rollins vs. Shinsuke Nakamura at WWE Fastlane Credit: WWE.com WWE Fastlane advertised Shinsuke Nakamura challenging Seth Rollins for the WWE World Heavyweight Championship, Iyo Sky defending the WWE Women\u2019s Championship against Asuka and Charlotte Flair, and the Judgment Day defending the Undisputed WWE Tag Team Championships against Cody Rhodes and Jey Uso. WWE\u2019s newly signed free agent Jade Cargill appeared in a backstage segment to greet Triple H as hype for her debut builds. Cargill received a loud pop from the Indianapolis crowd. Rhodes and Uso won the Tag Titles in the opening match, causing more dissension within the Judgment Day, and inevitably, the Bloodline. John Cena and LA Knight\u2019s match against The Bloodline featured a cameo appearance from Pat McAfee, who teased a WrestleMania in Indianapolis before doing guest commentary. This week\u2019s broadcast of WWE Raw was up, with 1.51 million viewers. SmackDown overnight ratings came in at 2.192 million viewers.

NXT XT Tuesday Night War | Pro Wrestling Bits WWE Fastlane 2023 Winners And Grades Jey Uso And Cody Rhodes Def. The Judgment Day Jey Uso came out with new gear, in the form of blue tights, and I was surprised Cody Rhodes didn\u2019t really match him. Michael Cole actually brought up the history of both Cody Rhodes and Finn Balor being former leaders of the Bullet Club and about 13 subredditors blushed. Jey Uso hit a spear and Micael Cole went out of his way to say how big of a deal it was because of Roman Reigns\u2019 pending return. Damian Priest sold his leg throughout the match, which played into whether or not he\u2019d cash in the Money in the Bank briefcase later. Jey kicked out of everything, even a briefcase shot from Rhea Ripley. Ultimately, Jey Uso and Cody Rhodes hit a modified 1D (with a Cody Cutter) for the win. Cody Rhodes and Jey Uso vs. Kevin Owens and Sami Zayn is going to be a great feud until Cody Rhodes is ready to finish his story at WrestleMania. Judgment Day vs. Jey Uso and Cody Rhodes Grade: A- LWO And Carlito Def. Lashley And Street Profits The Street Profits continue to come out to their babyface theme, but there were not red cups. I won\u2019t believe they\u2019ve developed a killer instinct until they switch to trap music. The majority of this match was two-on-three, much like the famous Bash at the Beach match between NWO and WCW. The third man was revealed to be Carlito, who came out to different theme music but the same massive pop he received in Puerto Rico. Carlito made quick work of the Street Profits and picked up the win. I love to see Carlito back, but I really hope Bobby Lashley doesn\u2019t wash his hands of the Street Profits. LWO vs. Bobby Lashley and the Street Profits Grade: B Iyo Sky Def. Charlotte Flair And Asuka There was product placement all over this show, from Pizza Hut to Slim Jim. In addition to the commercials on WWE Fastlane, even some of these segments felt like in-show commercials. Fans were not into Charlotte and instead backed Iyo Sky, much like WWE Backlash. Bayley ran down, and it seemed certain Bayley was going to cost Iyo the match. Instead, Bayley helped Iyo Sky retain. Iyo, who told Bayley to stay in the back, was overjoyed with Bayley\u2019s involvement. All is well within Damage CTRL for now. Women\u2019s Triple Threat Grade: B+ John Cena And LA Knight Def. The Bloodline Pat McAfee made a surprise appearance, and Michael Cole was (once again) legitimately surprised. McAfee called Cole the greatest of all time and took a shot at \u201chatin\u2019 ass\u201d Corey Graves. Then McAfee teased a WrestleMania in Indianapolis and headed to the commentary desk. For those wondering, yes, LA Knight\u2019s pop was even bigger than John Cena. Jey Uso\u2019s singles street gear is so much better than Jimmy\u2019s who is essentially wearing street clothes. The Bloodline spent an eternity getting heat on John Cena, but when he finally made the tag it led to an explosive pop and hot tag from LA Knight. By the end of LA Knight\u2019s comeback, all four stars were on the ground, leading to a Pavlovian \u201cthis is awesome\u201d chant. After the match, LA Knight declined John Cena raising his hand, and instead raised Cena\u2019s hand. Cena and Knight vs. Bloodline Grade: B+ Seth Rollins Def. Shinsuke Nakamura In a backstage segment, a banged up Damian Priest agreed not to cash in the Money in the Bank contract , even handing off the purple briefcase to Mami like he was her son. It was a very necessary segment if Priest wasn\u2019t going to cash in so fans wouldn\u2019t wonder why he didn\u2019t take advantage of such a golden opportunity. The main event entrances started at around 7:15 p.m. local time, so these two were going to get a lot of time. Both Seth Rollins and Shinsuke Nakamura wore elaborate robes to the ring. Last Man Standing Matches always take a while for fans to really get into it. They\u2019re typically long and have a lot of counting. But fans got more into this match the more weapons were introduced. Shinsuke Nakamura brought out nunchucks, and he was so good with them it made me want to see him as world champion. Michael Cole was the MVP of this match as he begged and pleaded with Seth Rollins not to risk a career-ending back injury by continuing the match. At one point, as Rollins was climbing the ladder, Cole told Graves \u201cyou\u2019ve known this man for 10 years, talk some damn sense into him!\u201d Shinsuke blew red mist in Seth Rollins\u2019 face atop a ladder, causing Rollins to fall through a table. The rest of this match looked like a bloody war. I wonder if WWE uses black and white when showing the replay. Rollins retained with a Falcon Arrow through a table while in the crowd. It was a very good main event. Shinsuke Nakamura vs. Seth Rollins Grade: A Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn . Check out my website or some of my other work here .

    "content": "David Axe Forbes Staff I write about ships, planes, tanks, drones, missiles and satellites. Following Oct 7, 2023, 10:50pm EDT | Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin U.S. Army art The Soviet-made Sagger anti-tank missile still was fairly new and, in the West, relatively unknown when Egyptian forces used it to devastating effect on the Israelis during the Yom Kippur War in 1973. The 26-pound, wire-guided missile could, and did, knock out Israeli tanks\u2014by the hundreds\u2014from several thousand yards away. The U.S. Army scrambled to develop a countermeasure and, 50 years later, the Ukrainian armed forces still are using it to defeat Russia\u2019s heavier, farther-flying anti-tank guided missiles. The crews of Ukraine\u2019s American-made Stryker wheeled fighting vehicles apparently are among the more successful in evading Russian ATGMs\u2014and for good reason. The Americans\u2019 classic \u201cSagger drill\u201d works best in a fast, maneuverable vehicle with good all-around optics. The 18-ton, 11-person Stryker checks all those boxes. A Sagger operator controls the missile via signals that travel to the missile mid-flight via a wire that unspools from the munition like silkworm\u2019s long thread. Eyeballing the target\u2019s movement, the operator carefully steers the missile in real time. This guidance method lends itself to interruption, evasion or both. The U.S. Army\u2019s Sagger drills never really were official, but field manuals describing missile-evasion techniques urged vehicle crews to stay alert for the telltale flash of a missile firing\u2014then maneuver in an \u201cerratic and zigzag path\u201d and get under cover, as fast as possible. The goal was to move faster, and more randomly, than a missile-operator could react to. Fifty years later, Russian anti-tank missiles\u2014including the 32-pound Konkurs and 64-pound Kornet\u2014range farther and might have laser guidance in place of the command guidance. But a Sagger drill still works at times, and especially in a vehicle as maneuverable as a Stryker is. Thanks to its 350-horsepower diesel engine, the eight-wheel IFV can accelerate to 60 miles per hour on good terrain. One Stryker driver explained how the vehicle\u2019s two-man crew stays alive on a battlefield teeming with missiles. \u201cIts main advantages are speed, maneuverability,\u201d the unnamed driver said of his IFV in an official video. Strykers crews run their own version of the Sagger drill. The first step is for the driver and commander to scan through their separate infrared optics\u2014the driver\u2019s Leonardo-made Driver\u2019s Vision Enhancer and the commander\u2019s camera-equipped Kongsberg Protector remote gun turret\u2014for the hot white flash of a missile launching from potentially miles away. \u201cWhen I was aimed at from an ATGM, sensors told me,\u201d the driver recalled. He immediately threw his vehicle into evasive action. \u201cI was able to make a decision either to slow down or speed up.\u201d Jinking foiled the missile\u2019s guidance. \u201cThe vehicle saves us,\u201d the driver added. To be sure, an old-school Sagger drill\u2014rooted as it is in a Middle East battlefield in 1973\u2014probably doesn\u2019t always work against the latest Russian anti-tank missiles in Ukraine in 2023. But it works often enough. Ukraine\u2019s independent air-assault forces have received nearly 200 Strykers from the United States and, despite deploying them to the vanguard of their four-month-old counteroffensive , have lost just three of them that outside analysts can confirm. Something is keeping those Strkyers in action. Well-executed Sagger drills might be one of the main things protecting the speedy wheeled vehicles from Russian missiles. Follow me on Twitter .

    "content": "TEMPE, Ariz. \u2014 For a guy who just notched his first Pac-12 victory, Deion Sanders was in no mood to celebrate Saturday night. \u201cI have great expectations,\u201d Sanders said after his son Shedeur Sanders, CU\u2019s starting quarterback, threw for 239 yards, including a critical 43-yard toss to Javon Antonio with 50 seconds left in a tie game, to power the Buffs to a 27-24 win over Arizona State early Saturday night at Mountain America Stadium. \u201cI have great expectations, and we\u2019re better than this. We really are better than this.\u201d The victory was CU\u2019s first in league play after an 0-2 conference start and moved the Buffs to 4-2 on the season. Coach Prime\u2019s roster is two wins away from bowl eligibility with six games left to play \u2014 three of the next four tilts coming at Folsom Field \u2014 thanks to Alejandro Mata\u2019s game-winning field goal from 43 yards out with 12 seconds left. \u201cWhy do you think I brought him here?\u201d the elder Sanders said. \u201cMata don\u2019t miss. He is who he is. That\u2019s what he always says, what he says to me, he says, \u2018I don\u2019t miss.\u2019 I told him, \u2018It\u2019s over. It is over. Go do your thing. Get your shine on.'\u201d The Buffs almost left this one too late. Almost. CU had secured momentum when Carter Stoutmire blocked an ASU field goal with 6:32 left, preserving a 24-17 CU lead. But the visitors couldn\u2019t take advantage, punting the ball back after seven plays and just 21 yards. ASU quarterback Trenton Bourguet took over from there, completing seven of 12 passes and orchestrating a 13-play, 94-yard touchdown drive capped by a stunning, 15-yard scoring pass to Troy Omeire and setting up the game-tying extra point. A drive that left Coach Prime seething after the game. \u201cI\u2019m trying to figure this out,\u201d Sanders said of his sixth game in charge of the Buffs and first Pac-12 victory. \u201cBecause I\u2019m sick of it. I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m happy about the win but I\u2019m not happy with the fashion (in which) we won the game. We\u2019re better than that.\u201d For much of the second half, they showed it. Shedeur Sanders could be seen sitting with his head in a towel with 3:20 left in the third quarter after two fruitless drives, one that included his fourth sack of the contest. But the transfer QB led the offense back onto the field with 1:07 left in the third quarter \u2014 and led with his passion and his legs. On second-and-3 from the Buffs\u2019 46, the CU signal-caller took off, picked up the first down, and engaged two ASU defenders than that slide to avoid contact. A 12-yard run set up a first down and another Sanders run, this one that evoked a late hit on Caleb McCullough and another set of downs at the Sun Devils\u2019 22. A zone-read mesh between the younger Sanders and Hankerson turned into a 13-yard rush to the hosts\u2019 9. CU took its first lead of the evening two plays later on a pick play in the end zone that freed up Javon Antonio for a 9-yard scoring catch. The extra point put the Buffs up 21-17 with 14:32 to play. \u201cThey left too much time on the clock,\u201d the younger Sanders said after leading CU to its second comeback victory over the last four weeks and first since a heart-stopping 43-35 double-overtime win vs. CSU on Sept. 16. \u201cIt\u2019s just something that kicks in \u2026 because that losing, it\u2019s not in me. If we got a chance, we\u2019re gonna win. \u2026 If it\u2019s not too late in the game, we\u2019re gonna win.\u201d Special teams, meanwhile, proved to be a mixed bag for the Buffs, to put it kindly. The highlight was Xavier Weaver\u2019s 51-yard punt return with 12:07 left in the game, a jolt to the visitors\u2019 sideline that gave CU the ball at the home 25. The drive stalled but Mata nailed a 42-yard field goal to extend the Buffs\u2019 lead to 24-17 with 10:13 remaining in the fourth stanza. The second surge came four minutes later, when Stoutmire got a mitt up and deflected Dario Longhetto\u2019s 52-yard field goal attempt, keeping the hosts scoreless in the second half. The Buffs looked to get the last word in a herky-jerky, see-saw first half when Shedeur Sanders saw a gap open up in the ASU defense on third-and-10, scrambling for a 16-yard score and trimming the Sun Devils\u2019 cushion to 14-13 before the extra point with 54 seconds left in the second quarter. But the hosts cowboyed-up, zipping 48 yards on seven snaps the other direction, capping a 50-second drive with a 33-yard field goal as time expired to reclaim the lead, 17-14, at the break. The polish and poise Coach Prime wanted to see early was absent for CU\u2019s first quarter-and-a-half. The Buffs had a kickoff trickle out of bounds, shanked a 29-yard punt that gave ASU the ball at midfield, and surrendered three sacks in the tilt\u2019s first 16 minutes and four seconds in the opening 25. CU converted just one of its first seven third-down opportunities. A Shilo Sanders missed tackle on third-and-7 with 11:30 left in the first half turned a potential 5-yard gain at the Buffs 18 into a 13-yarder and a fresh set of downs. ASU would score three plays later to regain the lead, 13-7. Center Van Wells missed first drive; the Buffs went backward, losing 12 yards on three snaps. Wells returned for the offense\u2019s second series as coordinator Sean Lewis shifted gears. Going with an even increased tempo, Hankerson touched the ball four straight times \u2014 catch, run, run, catch \u2014 to help propel CU from a third-and-3 at its own 32 to a first-and-10 at the ASU 42. The Buffs appeared to stall at the ASU 29, but the elder Sanders went for it on fourth-and-8 with a perfectly timed screen to speedy back Dylan Edwards, who found a corner and turned it up field for a 15-yard gain. The younger Sanders\u2019 next pass was 12-yard dart to Michael Harrison to to the Sun Devils 2. The visitors netted only one yard over the next three players, but Coach Prime rolled the dice again rather than attempt a short kick, and came up trumps again, as a slot run by Weaver got CU into the end zone for the first time and capped a 16-play, 75-yard drive that saw the Buffs convert both of their fourth-down tries.",

    "content": "Julia Louis-Dreyfus was \"deeply terrified\" by her 2017 breast cancer diagnosis. The 62-year-old 'Veep' actress admitted she was shocked to discover she had cancer and her immediate reaction was to laugh before becoming wildly hysterical. In conversation with journalist David Remnick at the 2023 New Yorker Festival, she said: \"I started laughing. Well, because the night before, I had won an Emmy. And so, I came downstairs and \u2026 the Emmy was there. It was like on the dining room table. I'm coming down to get coffee. My cell phone rings, and it's my doctor saying, 'Guess what, you have cancer'. \"And I'm like, 'Huh? What?' And so, it was a very bizarre juxtaposition. And, of course, I did laugh, and then I became hysterical, crying, because I was terrified, as most people are, or as all people are if they get a diagnosis like that.\" And, while Julia had a supportive family around her, it did not stop her being terrified of what lay ahead. She said: \"I have a very strong and supportive family, and for which I am eternally grateful, upon whom I relied \u2014 sisters, husband, my sons, my mother, my mothers, my stepmother, everybody. \"I was deeply terrified because who wouldn't be? I mean, all the tropes are true. You know, you get that call and it's like, 'What, me? No, no, no.' I mean, you can't imagine that something like that would happen to you.\" Julia announced she was cancer-free in October 2018 following a double mastectomy and six rounds of chemotherapy and says her illness has given her a new perspective on life. She said: \"I'm just so happy to be here, you know. I think I'm enjoying things more. I think I work hard now to try not to allow my stress to enter my body if I can do it. That\u2019s a difficult nut to crack, you know, for sure, because we're all stressed. But it does have an impact. \"I'm not saying I got cancer from stress, necessarily, but it's not good for you. And it's also not a happy place to live in. So, I'm just very focused on \u2026 trying to enjoy my life as much as possible.\"",

    "content": "Initial observations from the CU Buffs\u2019 27-24 win over the Arizona State Sun Devils in head coach Deion Sanders\u2019 first Pac-12 victory at Mountain America Stadium in Tempe, Ariz. : Here\u2019s guessing ASU head coach Kenny Dillingham spent time watching Rocky Mountain Showdown tape. The Sun Devils play-caller took a page out of CSU\u2019s playbook early on, drawing up the same shallow crossing routes the Rams used to pick apart CU\u2019s defense to power a nine-play, 66-yard scoring drive to open the game. Quarterback Trenton Bourguet completed four \u2014 two for gains of 27-plus yards \u2014 in yet another troubling start for CU. For the third straight week, one team came ready to play right out of the gates with an opening possession TD. The other had some really sweet helmets. : Following another familiar theme, Buffs quarterback Shedeur Sanders was under siege from the opening offensive snap. CU\u2019s first drive of the game? A three-and-out that included one sack and an intentional grounding flag. The Sun Devils tacked on two more sacks and four quarterback hits by the end of the first half \u2014 one that saw the Buffs go three-and-out on three of their first five possessions. Throw in a pair of false starts that nearly killed CU\u2019s first touchdown drive, and it wasn\u2019t a great start for a CU front five that entered Saturday with the second-most sacks allowed in FBS. : The benefit of having a talent like Shedeur Sanders at quarterback? He can erase a lot of those issues on his own. That was certainly the case when the junior authored a two-minute drive to close out the first half, one that ended with him scrambling from a collapsing pocket on third-and-10 for a 16-yard touchdown. It was again when he marched CU down the field for a go-ahead touchdown early in the fourth quarter, converting a pair of first downs with his feet, then audibling into a pass and delivering a dart to Javon Antonio on second-and-goal for a 9-yard score. And, of course, there was the 43-yard strike to Antonio with 50 seconds to go. Perfectly placed, and exactly what CU needed. : Yes, the Buffs were playing an inferior team. And, yes, said team was starting its third-string quarterback. Don\u2019t care. Winning conference games on the road is hard, even against a rebuilding program like ASU that no doubt had this game circled on the calendar (because every CU opponent does). That the Buffs escaped with a win is the sign of a mature team, especially when so many helped close the door. Xavier Weaver\u2019s 51-yard punt return. Carter Stoutmire flying in off the edge to disrupt an ASU field goal attempt that went wide. The defense securing five sacks. And, yes, kicker Alejandro Mata, the clutch one, from 42 and 43 yards, the latter to win the game. It was tense. It was ugly. It was way too close for comfort. It\u2019s also a W. : If we can be allowed one tiny quibble with Coach Prime, let it be this: He sure has a hair trigger when it comes to using his timeouts. A week after clock management issues marred CU\u2019s comeback attempt against USC and Prime had no timeouts remaining when the Buffs drew within a touchdown of the Trojans, the Buffs burned through all three of their first-half timeouts before the end of the first quarter. Then he used another on ASU\u2019s first drive of the third quarter when Coach Dillingham pump-faked going for it on fourth-and-9 near midfield. Maybe let that play out, Coach?",

    "description": "Montana Western scored 21 straight points to upend No. 11-ranked Montana Tech on Saturday in Butte.",
    "content": "HELENA \u2014 Did someone order four top-25-ranked Frontier Conference football teams? Because that\u2019s what fans will likely see on Monday afternoon when the newest edition of the NAIA\u2019s coaches\u2019 poll is revealed, something Montana Western\u2019s propensity for beating ranked Montana Tech teams made possible. Man, is the Bulldogs\u2019 offense impressive, or what? Nearly 500 yards of offense, and a critical eight-play, 75-yard drive late in the third quarter to go up two scores, helped Western knock off a nationally-ranked Orediggers team for the fourth time in the last six years (Nov. 5, 2022; Oct. 6, 2018; Oct. 7, 2017). That game six years ago, in Dillon, was against a top-five Tech team, while this year\u2019s victory goes a long way in solidifying the Bulldogs\u2019 highest national ranking of the season and signals to the nation Western\u2019s intention to return to the national playoffs. Michael Palandri, in just his fifth-ever start under center, threw just one incomplete pass in the first half and finished 19-for-27 for 224 yards and a touchdown. His 13-yard score on QB power was the cherry on top of that aforementioned eight-play drive. Running backs Pete Gibson and Jake Humphrey combined for 200 yards and a touchdown on 27 carries. Humphrey, a redshirt freshman out of Walla Walla, Washington, cut back through a crease in the offensive line and sprinted 11 yards into the end zone for his second career touchdown in the first quarter. Gibson, a Dillon native, ripped off rushes of 29 and 35 yards in the second half, the latter of which set up Palandri\u2019s dive for the pylon two plays later. Western\u2019s defense has struggled defending the pass this season and was gashed for another 306 yards and three touchdowns by Tech quarterback Blake Thelen on Saturday. Jordan Jackson enjoyed a career day, hauling in eight passes for 153 yards and two touchdowns, but his 37-yard fourth-quarter score was all the Orediggers managed following a 21-point first half. Kameron Rauser produced Western\u2019s first defensive touchdown of the season \u2013 a 43-yard scoop and score on a fumbled Tech snap in the first quarter. Leading 24-21 early in the second half, Western\u2019s Reese Artz blocked a Ryan Lowry field goal attempt. Western scored on its next two drives to ice the game. Western's Eli Nourse paced the Bulldogs with seven catches, 81 yards, and a touchdown. Nourse's two-yard rushing score was what put Western up by 17 points in the fourth quarter. Now averaging 473.2 yards per game, Western's offense is the seventh-most productive in the NAIA. More importantly, the Bulldogs improve to 2-1 in conference play (4-1 overall) and knock Tech out of a first-place tie with Carroll College atop the Frontier standings. Kaysan Barnett picked SOU quarterback Blake Asciutto off twice (part of four total Raiders turnovers), but the Battlin\u2019 Bears managed just 10 yards rushing, and yielded 280, in a second straight loss. Once, statistically, the best run defense in the NAIA, Rocky facilitated two, 100-yard rushers on Saturday as SOU averaged 6.7 yards per carry. Isaiah Hidalgo picked up 148 yards on 14 carries, while Avery McCuaig found pay dirt thrice and totaled 132 yards. McCuaig, a senior from Calgary, Alberta, scored on a pair of two-yard runs and again on an eight-yarder \u2013 all in the first half \u2013 to aid a 20-3 Raiders halftime advantage. McCuaig (with College of Idaho and Arizona Christian still to play) currently the Frontier with eight rushing touchdowns. Rocky quarterback Luke Holcomb totaled 188 yards through the air in the loss. He left the game to begin the fourth quarter, leaving junior Graedyn Buell to finish the contest. An ineligible man downfield penalty (on a fake punt) ended Buell\u2019s first drive and he was intercepted in the end zone on his second possession, all but sealing Rocky\u2019s fate on Saturday. Rocky wide-out Joseph Dwyer caught nine passes for 129 yards, while running back Zaire Wilcox supplemented his tough day running the football with seven catches and 59 yards. The Battlin\u2019 Bears, who fall to 1-3 in conference play (3-3 overall), have not scored a second-half point on offense in three straight games. A third-quarter safety was all they managed on Saturday in the game\u2019s final 30 minutes. SOU is now 1-2 in league play and 2-3 overall. Mountaineers wide-out Malachi Spurrier enjoyed a second consecutive 100-yard receiving game (six catches, 116 yards, two touchdowns) and EOU won its second straight game to emerge from the depths of the Frontier standings. Northern totaled a season-high 253 yards of offense, but turned the ball over three times, including an interception in the end zone mid-way through the third quarter of a 21-3 game. Sophomore running back Mason Dionne eclipsed the 100-yard threshold for the second time in his career, rushing for a career-high 120 yards, and Caymus Thomas caught six passes for 53 yards for the Lights. EOU quarterback Quincy Glasper threw for 257 yards and three touchdowns. His 27-yarder to Spurrier late in the third quarter was in response to a Northern turnover, putting the Lights in an insurmountable four-touchdown hole. Northern was penalized 12 times for 116 yards on Saturday, as a combined 24 penalties for 226 yards were accepted. It was Northern\u2019s second game of the season with 100-plus penalty yards. EOU\u2019s Aiden Patterson (rushing) and Blake Davis (receiving) scored touchdowns for the Mountaineers who improved to 2-2 in league play (2-4 overall) with the victory. Northern, following Southern Oregon\u2019s victory over Rocky Mountain College, is the last remaining winless conference team (0-3) in the Frontier. The Lights have lost 16 straight Frontier games dating back to the 2021 season.",

    "description": "The Israeli military says that a number of Palestinian militants have infiltrated into Israel from the Gaza Strip.",
    "content": "ASHKELON, Israel \u2014 Israel was plunged into chaos Saturday after the Palestinian militant group Hamas launched a deadly land, air and sea attack inside the country, with fighters infiltrating the southern border and firing a massive barrage of rockets from the Gaza Strip . \"We are in a war,\" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared in a video on social media. He ordered strikes on Gaza and called for an \"extensive reserve mobilization\" as the nation responds to the unprecedented incursion. Over 200 Israelis have been killed and more than 1,200 were injured, a spokesperson for Israel Defense Forces said. The Palestinian Ministry of Health said 232 people were killed after Israeli airstrikes there, with about 1,700 injured. Hamas fighters captured a number of civilians and soldiers as hostages, with fighting ongoing in southern Israel many hours after the operation began, the Israeli military said. President Joe Biden condemned what he called an \u201cappalling assault against Israel by Hamas terrorists\u201d and said that \u201cIsrael has a right to defend itself and its people.\u201d He added, \u201cMy Administration\u2019s support for Israel\u2019s security is rock solid and unwavering.\u201d Follow live updates here The militant group Hamas , which rules Gaza, said it was behind the operation and dubbed it \u201cAl-Aqsa Flood.\u201d The Hamas incursion, stunning in its boldness and complexity, marked a major escalation of its conflict with the Israeli government. \u201cEnough is enough,\u201d the elusive leader of the group's military wing, Mohammed Deif, said in a recorded message that called on Palestinians to join the fight. \u201cThis is the day of the greatest battle to end the last occupation on earth,\u201d he said, adding that 5,000 rockets had been launched. The militant group said it had taken a large number of hostages, including senior Israeli officers. Western leaders lamented the outbreak of violence. Biden said he told Netanyahu in a call that \"we stand ready to offer all appropriate means of support to the Government and people of Israel.\" \"Terrorism is never justified. Israel has a right to defend itself and its people. The United States warns against any other party hostile to Israel seeking advantage in this situation,\" Biden said in a statement. European heads of state \u2014 including German Chancellor OIaf Scholz and French President Emmanuel Macron \u2014 excoriated Hamas and expressed solidarity with Israel. Itamar Ben-Gvir, Israel\u2019s security minister, declared a state of civil emergency, giving police additional powers to carry out raids and arrests. Across Israel\u2019s Route 3, a highway 15 miles north of Gaza, police armed with assault rifles fanned out across roads, checking cars for gunmen trying to pass farther into the country. Highways across the country also emptied out except for emergency vehicles, as security forces erected checkpoints for passing traffic. The military said fighting was ongoing across the country's south many hours after the incursion began, adding that an unspecified number of civilians and soldiers had been taken hostage. In Tel Aviv, residents rushed to hospitals and medical offices to donate blood for the injured, as the city's leaders ordered that bomb shelters be opened. Israel's rescue service has provided care to \u201chundreds\u201d of injured individuals, from moderate to serious, it said, adding that helicopters, mobile ICUs and bullet-proof ambulances have been mobilized. The violence follows weeks of heightened tensions along Israel\u2019s volatile border with Gaza, and heavy fighting in the Israeli-occupied West Bank \u2014 but also years of unresolved grievances over the treatment of Palestinians that have long threatened to erupt. The Israeli military confirmed that an infiltration had occurred in several locations near the Gaza barrier in southern Israel. It ordered residents to remain indoors. Israel has built a massive fence along the Gaza border meant to prevent infiltrations. It goes deep underground and is equipped with cameras, high-tech sensors and sensitive listening technology. Israel and Egypt imposed a blockade over Gaza after Hamas seized control of the territory in 2007. There have been four wars since then, most recently in 2021. There have also been numerous rounds of fighting between Israel and Hamas and other smaller militant groups based in Gaza. The blockade, which restricts the movement of people and goods in and out of Gaza, has devastated the territory\u2019s economy. Israel says it is needed to keep militant groups from building up their arsenals, while the Palestinians say it amounts to collective punishment. Saturday's stunning developments come at a crucial moment, as Israel pursues what would be a landmark deal to normalize relations with Saudi Arabia that is being brokered by the United States. Any new outbreak of fighting is likely to strain that process and pose a major foreign policy challenge for Biden as he pursues re-election in 2024. The assault follows a period of heavy fighting in the West Bank, where nearly 200 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli military raids this year, according to U.N. Mideast Envoy Tor Wennesland. Israel says the raids are aimed at militants, but stone-throwing protesters and people uninvolved in the violence have also been killed. Palestinian attacks on Israeli targets have killed over 30 people so far in 2023, Wennesland said in an August briefing to the U.N. Security Council. The surprise Hamas offensive comes 50 years and a day after Israel's Arab neighbors launched a coordinated surprise attack that began the 1973 Arab-Israeli war. Like that moment, Saturday's incursion will serve as a significant embarrassment to Israel\u2019s vaunted intelligence apparatus. It comes after months of domestic turmoil over the government\u2019s efforts to overhaul the judiciary, which led to mass protests and a rare break between political leaders and the military. Raf Sanchez reported from Ashkelon, Israel; Daniel Arkin from New York; and Max Burman from London.",

    "content": "Argentinian voters are deciding whether to proceed with a (CBDC) or rely on the U.S. dollar as legal tender before the presidential elections. Sergio Massa, current Minister of the Economy, is running for presidency under the Union for the Homeland party and is a keen advocate of a new digital currency for Argentina. His main rival, Javier Milei, running under the umbrella of the Libertarian Party, is pushing for the of the Argentine economy as a solution for the country\u2019s economic travails. Ahead of the October 22 polls, analysts say voters will be split along the lines of monetary policy, with their decision expected to have lasting effects on the Argentinian economy. If citizens vote in Massa, Argentina will turn to a CBDC to solve its economic woes, but there are concerns that it could be a long, bumpy road ahead. The country is still in the research phase, while its peers in the have begun experimenting with CBDCs. In contrast, its next-door neighbor, , has surged ahead with a CBDC pilot, enlisting commercial banks, fintech firms, and service providers to assist in developing the digital realm. The other option for citizens is Milei\u2019s dollarization plan\u2014an ambitious scheme to shut down the central bank and make the U.S. dollar the de facto currency. Milei\u2019s plan is a response to the \u201cshoddy\u201d handling of the local economy by the banking regulator, leading to waves of galloping inflations over the last decade and national currency devaluation. Currently, many residents are hedging their wealth with the U.S. dollar, citing its stability over the peso. Among emerging markets, the peso has been tagged the worst-performing currency after losing half of its value against the dollar. \u201cThe peso melts like ice in the Sahara,\u201d said Milei ahead of the showdown with Massa at the polls. However, plans to replace the peso with the dollar still have to contend with local and international opposition. On the international front, Argentina has been invited to join BRICS, a coalition of nations described as potential emerging superpowers. In recent months, BRICS have made moves to the U.S. dollar in bilateral trading, relying on their native currencies for transactions. Should Argentina elect Milei, the country\u2019s membership in BRICS hangs in the balance, given his affinity for the dollar. Around 90% of 81 central banks are already exploring the viability of CBDCs to improve financial inclusion, payments, and cross-border transactions, according to a by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS). However, rolling out a CBDC is fraught with , including stiff competition from existing payment options and the potential elimination of cash. To solve the challenge, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the BIS are pushing for in the development of CBDCS. Concerning cross-border functionality, the BIS has been experimenting with ways to improve the interoperability of CBDCs with its recently concluded .

    "description": "The last time someone hit the Powerball jackpot was back in July, when one very lucky lottery player won $1.08 billion.",
    "content": "WASHINGTON, USA \u2014 Powerball offered an eye-popping $1.4 billion jackpot for Saturday night's drawing, but the massive prize will be growing even larger after no one correctly matched all six numbers . The winning numbers were 47-54-57-60-65 with Powerball 19 and Power Play 3. Monday's jackpot will be an estimated $1.55 billion, which remains the third-largest prize in the Powerball's history. It'll also be the fourth-largest jackpot in any U.S. lottery game after rolling over for 34 consecutive drawings, since the last time someone won the top prize on July 19 . That streak trails the record of 41 draws set in 2021 and 2022. While no one hit the jackpot, 10 tickets won at least $1 million. Ten tickets matched all five of the white ball numbers and are worth $1 million: one in California, one in Kansas, one in Louisiana, two tickets in Massachusetts, one in Michigan, one in Ohio, two in Texas and one in Wisconsin. Two more tickets matched all five of the white ball numbers and chose the optional Power Play, meaning they're worth $2 million. Those tickets were sold in Iowa and Maine. A jackpot winner Monday would get either the full $1.55 billion paid out over 30 years, or a cash payout of $679.8 million. Winners almost always take the cash option. It's also the first time in the game's history that back-to-back cycles have generated billion-dollar prizes, according to Powerball. RELATED : These have been the 'luckiest' Powerball numbers in the last 8 years The lengthy streak without a jackpot winner is due to the game's long odds, 1 in 292.2 million , that are designed to make winning rare so grand prizes can grow large. Even with the smaller lump sum payout, federal taxes will eat into those winnings, and some states also tax big lottery prizes. Powerball is played in 45 states, as well as Washington, D.C., Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The winning numbers are 47-54-57-60-65 with Powerball 19 and Power Play 3. The Powerball drawing takes place live at 10:59 p.m. Eastern every Monday, Wednesday and Saturday. Tickets, which cost $2 per play, are sold in 45 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The odds of winning the Powerball jackpot are one in 292.2 million. Over the past few years, huge lottery jackpots have become more common as lottery officials have changed the rules and ticket prices to boost top prizes. Powerball's biggest change came in 2021 when officials decided to add a Monday drawing to its weekly lineup of Wednesday and Saturday evening drawings. At the time of the announcement, Powerball proclaimed the addition of the Monday drawing would lead to \"larger, faster-growing jackpots.\"",

    "content": "BERKELEY \u2014 Cal might have found a quarterback on Saturday night against No. 15 Oregon State. But the Bears somehow lost their defense in a 52-40 defeat before 34,930 fans at Memorial Stadium. The Bears (3-3, 1-2 Pac-12) gave redshirt freshman Fernando Mendoza the start at quarterback and he played competently while throwing a pair of touchdown passes. But Clemson transfer DJ Uiagalelei threw five touchdown passes and the Beavers (5-1, 2-1) reached the end zone on their first four possessions of the second half to methodically pull away. Cal could not stop the Beavers, who piled up 498 yards, including 296 through the air. Uiagalelei finished 19 for 25 for 275 yards with the five TDs \u2014 three of them to tight end Jack Velling. His understudy, freshman Aidan Chiles, added a TD pass of his own in the second quarter. \u201cGood God . . . I was trying to think of plays we made on defense. We didn\u2019t do any of that,\u201d Cal coach Justin Wilcox said. \u201cBoy, that was . . . bad defense right there by us. \u201cThe offense and Fernando, they\u2019re the only reason we even had a chance in the game based on what we did on defense and kickoff team.\u201d The game was the first in an unprecedented stretch of five straight games for the Bears against teams ranked in the Top-25. Next up is No. 18 Utah (4-1, 1-1), which had a bye Saturday to prepare for the matchup at Salt Lake City. The Utes have won 17 consecutive home games and 27 of their past 28. Cal may be without a couple of offensive starters next Saturday. Sophomore running back Jaydn Ott, who rushed for 84 first-half yards against OSU\u2019s stout run defense, carried the ball just once more and did not play the final 28 minutes of the game. Starting right guard Sioape Vatikani was taken off the field on a cart after apparently suffering a lower-body injury with just under 12 minutes left in the game. Cal\u2019s coaches had mentioned several times recently the progress made in practice by Mendoza, a 6-foot-5, 220-pounder from Miami, Florida. But he hadn\u2019t gotten any playing time in the Bears\u2019 previous four games after seeing some mop-up duty in the opener. The Bears\u2019 quarterback play with Sam Jackson V and Ben Finley mostly sharing the position through five games had been inconsistent, and after last week\u2019s 24-21 win over Arizona State there became greater urgency to get production from the passing game. Mendoza didn\u2019t light up the OSU defense, but he appeared to make good decisions on his reads and he was 21 for 32 for 207 yards with one interception. \u201cI had the best time of my life out there. It was just great playing with my brothers,\u201d Mendoza said. \u201cI think I played pretty well, but at the end of the day the only thing that matters to me is winning. I believe I did decently well for my first start . . . I\u2019m just looking forward to Utah. I knew we\u2019re going to have a chance against them and I just can\u2019t wait.\u201d Against the Beavers, Mendoza threw touchdown passes of 9 yards to Isaiah Ifanse in the second quarter and 30 yards to tight end Jack Endries with 2:45 left in the third. After the second one, he found Jeremiah Hunter with a two-point conversion pass completion and the Bears trailed just 35-32. \u201cHe earned the opportunity by what he\u2019s done and also the lack of consistency we\u2019ve had at the position I thought he did a heck of a job,\u201d Cal coach Justin Wilcox said of Mendoza. \u201cHe was not perfect, but he brought energy to the game. You could tell the tempo on offense was different. He threw the ball pretty well, he made some plays with his feet. Overall, I\u2019m very pleased with what Fernando did .. . for his first start in that environment against that defense.\u201d Ifanse,the graduate transfer from Montana State, rushed for 86 yards and scored three touchdowns for the Bears. Mendoza added 42 rushing yards as Cal piled up 241 rushing yards against an OSU defense that hadn\u2019t allowed more than 106 in a game. The Beavers led 21-17 after an entertaining first half. Mendoza was 3 for 5 for 13 yards on the Bears\u2019 first series, which ended after he threw incomplete on fourth-and-2 from the OSU. He wound up 10 for 17 for 68 yards in the first half, including a 9-yard touchdown pass to Ifanse. Mendoza started to dash out of the pocket on the play then stopped and delivered a quick pass to the running back for the TD, pulling Cal within 14-10 with 11:16 left in the second quarter. That touchdown was set up by Ryan McCulloch\u2019s 26-yard return of an OSU onside kickoff try, giving the Bears possession at the Beavers\u2019 19-yard line. On the next series, Cal safety Patrick McMorris recovered a fumble by Beavers\u2019 receiver Silas Bolden after Jackson Sirmon knocked the ball free, giving the Bears possession at the OSU 49. Ott raced 21 yards on first down before Mendoza gained 11 yards on a keeper to the 17. Ifanse scored his second touchdown of the night \u2014 his second in a span of 3:07 \u2014 when he virtually walked into the end zone, pushing the Bears into a 17-14 lead with 8:09 to play in the half.",

    "content": "Of all the street foods, elote is certainly a popular one. The food originated in Mexico but has become well-known around the world. Although the spiced, cheesy corn on the cob may be ordered in some restaurants, it's also fairly easy to prepare at home. Making involves grilling corn on the cob, then brushing it with a little bit of mayonnaise. It's then flavored with chili powder, crumbled cotija cheese, and cayenne pepper. For an added burst of acidity, you can add on some lime juice for a finishing touch. If you aren't a fan of eating corn on the cob or you just want to use up that's been long-forgotten in the back of your pantry, you can use canned corn for a bowl full of elote flavors. All you'll need to do is roast your canned corn, then mix it in with the standard elote toppings before digging in. While you can mix up a single serving just for yourself to enjoy, the corn could also make an excellent side dish for taco night. If you want that same slightly smoky flavor that you'd get from grilling your corn, you can still achieve it with the canned variety. Just drain the liquid from the can after it's opened, and dry the corn as best you can. Then toss the corn with a little bit of oil, and spread it out on a sheet pan to roast in the oven or in a pan on the stovetop. You can even add in a little splash of for more flavor. While your , you can combine the mayonnaise, lime juice, seasonings, and cotija cheese in a separate bowl. Once the corn is done and slightly cooled, you can pour it in the bowl and mix it around until each piece is evenly coated. Then, you can simply grab a fork and dig in to your delicious side dish. The bowl will combine all the elote's flavors without the mess of eating corn on the cob. This is also called esquites. Of course, you can stick to the most common elote ingredients when making your Mexican street corn salad. But if you want to amplify the flavors even more, you can bulk up the bowl with some rice, protein, and other toppings to make it more like a burrito bowl. Just remember to keep your corn as the star of the show if you want to really amplify the elote aspect of the dish. You can also use that canned corn to create a Mexican street corn-inspired chip dip. Mix the roasted canned corn, mayonnaise, spices, , and cheese with a little bit of cream cheese and sour cream to make the dip a little creamier. Garnish the dip with a little bit of cilantro, grab some tortilla chips, and scoop up the dip to eat. The next time you're craving some elote, just grab a can of corn and a bowl to make a simplified version of the street food.",

Even if you wanted to argue Kershaw deserved this to go down as an error instead of the hit it was ruled, Marte hit the ball 115.7 miles per hour.

The Snakes weren't done, though. After Kershaw finally recorded his first out, drew a walk and then hammered a ball in the left-center gap to score Thomas. It was 6-0 D-Backs and the end of the night for Kershaw. \"He just made mistakes and they capitalized on them,\" catcher said about Kershaw's outing. This was the worst playoff outing of Kershaw's Hall of Fame career. Let's break it down: There's long been a narrative surrounding Kershaw that he couldn't pitch well in the playoffs or shrunk from the biggest moments or something in that ballpark. He has actually had a good number of stellar playoff outings, but there's a reason the bad ones stick out in the minds of so many people. He has a 2.48 ERA in his career in the regular season. In the playoffs? He's pitched in 194 1/3 innings and has a 4.49 ERA. When the ERA jumps nearly two runs and it isn't a small sample, there's simply no arguing that something has been different.",

    "description": "Robert Rodriguez is waiting in anticipation for an Alita: Battle Angel sequel.",
    "content": "Fans hoping to see a sequel to Alita: Battle Angel may finally be getting a follow-up . The initial adaptation grossed a sizable $404 million globally and has since become a cult classic with a huge following online. A sequel has yet to be officially greenlit given the rights lay with 20th Century Studios, the movie studio formerly known as 20th Century Fox. According to Alita helmer Robert Rodriguez , now that the smoke from the Disney and Fox merger has cleared, it's increasingly possible work may begin on Alita 2 sooner rather than later. \"Yeah, Jim [Cameron] and I always talk about how we'd love to do another Alita ,\" Rodriguez told TheWrap this week. \"That studio [20th Century] was bought by another studio [Disney]. They're starting to make movies now. But that for a while 20th Century wasn't making any of their movies. I think now you're seeing a few rolling out. We would love to.\" Rodriguez directed the film from a script written by James Cameron and Laeta Kalogridis. Earlier this year, Cameron not only said sequels were happening, but it was likely multiple films would be made in the franchise . Cameron's Oscar-winning, money-making Avatar franchise is 20th Century's biggest property, so it's likely only a matter of time before the filmmaker is able to get more of the movies off the ground. \"Robert [Rodriguez] and I had a conversation about it two weeks ago. We're very excited about that prospect,\" Alita producer and frequent Cameron collaborator Jon Landau told us last year . \" Alita is is a movie that even now having recently like re-watched it for what we had, we're really proud of that movie. And we think that there are more stories to tell with her character and that's why we want to go back to it.\" He added, \"Alita Army! Way to go keep it up. I got, I tell you a funny story. I went back to Los Angeles. I've been in New Zealand for quite some time and I went back to Los Angeles over the summer and the day I was there, the first day back, I opened the Los Angeles Times and there's an ad from the Alita Army in color and I was like, 'There you go! Thank you. Keep it up!'\" Alita: Battle Angel is now streaming on Hulu. 0 comments Related: Alita: Battle Angel Cosplay Preps For a Potential Sequel Avatar Producer Jon Landau Teases Alita: Battle Angel Sequel Plans Alita Director Robert Rodriguez Was Born to Make a JoJo's Bizarre Adventure Movie Alita: Battle Angel Star Christoph Waltz Speaks Out on Sequel Plans",

    "description": "Miami had a chance to put the game away, but a crucial mistake turned into a last-second Georgia Tech win",
    "content": "beat No. 17 23-20 Saturday evening thanks to an improbable last-second touchdown pass. With 10 seconds left on the clock, Yellow Jackets quarterback took a snap from the shotgun at Miami's 44-yard line. His initial reads weren't open, so he scrambled to his right towards his right. At the same time, wide receiver streaked toward the end zone. Leary raced past Miami's deep defensive backs and King let the ball fly. Leary caught it in-stride around the 10-yard line without a defender near him. He slid into the end zone to give Georgia Tech its decisive 23-20 lead. Instead of risking a blocked extra point, the Yellow Jackets kneeled the ball on the extra-point attempt. Miami got the ball back with two seconds, but Georgia Tech's defense held. Perhaps the even more improbable than the touchdown is how Georgia Tech got in a position to win the game. Miami had the ball and a 20-17 lead, with less than a minute on the clock. Georgia Tech didn't have any timeouts left. Instead of kneeling the ball out, Miami coach Mario Cristobal bafflingly drew up a run play on third-and-10 from Georgia Tech's 30-yard line. Running back Don Chaney Jr. fumbled the ball and Georgia Tech recovered, a play that held up after official review. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the biggest coaching mistakes at this level that I have ever seen in my lifetime.\u201d Miami could've taken a knee and closed out Georgia Tech. Instead ... disaster struck \ud83d\ude33 \"At the end of the game, chance to put it away and should have just told them to take a timeout right there,\" Cristobal said after the game. \"Recalibrate and just take a knee. So, we gave them a chance and they took advantage of it and scored.\" Of note, to Cristobal when he was the coach at Oregon towards the end of a 2018 overtime loss to Stanford. King completed a 30-yard pass to on the ensuing drive to set up what became the game-winning touchdown pass.",

    "description": "Paul tallied six points and five assists in 13 minutes in win over Lakers",
    "content": "SAN FRANCISCO -- In a preseason opener more intriguing than most in recent memory, it took all of two quarters of basketball to demonstrate the exact reasons why general manager Jr. brought in the 18-year veteran guard this offseason. In the opening minutes of the second quarter of the Warriors' 127-110 win over the on Saturday night, Paul gave a slight nod to starting backcourt mate , surreptitiously inviting him to set a ball screen. Curry readily accepted, but instead of walloping Lakers forward with all 185 pounds of his frame, Curry slipped the screen, creating confusion from Lakers guard , who appeared to think Prince was going to switch. As all defenses know by now, a split-second of airspace is a death sentence when it comes to Curry, who hit nothing but net on the 3-pointer after the assist from Paul. CP3 to Steph ... \ud83d\udca6 Live look at the entire Bay Area after watching that exchange: Paul is one of the best players in NBA history with the ball in his hands. Curry is probably best without it. Making defenses pick their poison is going to be a staple of Warriors offense this season, and it was on display in one single play on Saturday night. \"There's a pace to the game that is fun to watch as a coach, where you just kind of know he's going to be making the right play over and over,\" Warriors coach Steve Kerr said of Paul after the game. \"He understands when we need to pull it back and get into an action, or play faster, because he understands the rhythm of the game. So, Chris is amazing. Really fun to have him on our side, finally.\" Another reason the Warriors brought in Paul, who finished with six points and five assists in 13 minutes in his debut, is to help with their late-clock offense. Kerr's ball-movement heavy, quick-hitting attack is all well and good when it's working, but what about when it stalls out? Golden State was 20th in the NBA in offensive efficiency in the last four seconds of the shot clock last season, per Synergy Sports, and they struggled to find options outside of Curry in the playoffs -- leading Kerr to this season. On Saturday night, Paul showed how he can come to the rescue in those situations. Midway through the second quarter, with less than 10 seconds on the shot-clock, CP3 went old school. He called up center to set him a ball screen, drove into the lane, froze Lakers big man with a head fake, then hit a floater that he's made millions of times. As close to automatic as it gets. CP's float game is \ud83d\udd25 Curry at the start of camp, and the preseason opener only confirmed that assertion. The two even shared a nice chuckle on the sidelines after hit Curry with a bullet pass ... while he was standing on the sideline checked out of the game. JK found Steph in the corner ... except he wasn't in the game \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude05 Injury concerns? Of course. Defensive issues? Maybe. But so far, the Curry-Paul backcourt is looking as good as advertised. And the scary thing for the rest of the league is that they're only going to become more devastating as familiarity builds, and they continue to spread their knowledge to the young Warriors on the roster. \"[Paul's] making my life easier every single day,\" said Kuminga, who had a game-high 24 points to go with eight rebounds and four assists. \"I mean, they're gonna get on me when I'm not doing the right things, and I feel like, so far, it's been him helping me out to read more certain things of the game.\"",

    "content": "[Kevin Hunckler] recently did some in-house manufacturing for a product and shared his experiences in to give the finished units a professional look. The results look great and were easy to apply, making his product more attractive without needing much assembly work. Sadly, when doing initial research he was disappointed to find very little information on the whole process. While in the end it isn\u2019t terribly complex, it still involved a lot of trial and error before he zeroed in on what the suppliers in the industry expect. Fortunately, everything can be done with tools most hackers probably already have access to. The process seems to us somewhat reminiscent of having PCBs manufactured. One defines the product housing, outlines the overlay, creates the artwork, defines an adhesive layer, and makes a design document explaining each layer and important feature. [Kevin] provides examples of his work, one of which fits an off-the-shelf Hammond enclosure. Professionally-made acrylic panels or graphic overlays is something worth keeping in mind for hobbyists and those who might engage in desktop manufacturing, as long as the costs are acceptable. Rather like PCBs, costs go down as quantities go up. [Kevin]\u2019s 50 mm x 50 mm overlay cost about 1 USD each in quantity 200, but only 0.50 USD each when buying 500. These may be great for low or middling quantities, but that doesn\u2019t mean one is out of options for prototypes or micro quantities. We have seen , and even using a 3D printer to .",

The vapour trails of tradition are long and cold The UK press is catching up with the US \u2013 the mood translates. In the Spectator , Cristina Odone argued, \u201cthe key to improving children\u2019s lives is marriage, an institution few dare defend,\u201d calling for the government to change the tax system, boosting the Marriage Allowance so couples share all their personal tax allowance to, \u201csend out the message that tying the knot is worth their while\u201d. The right wing, Traister explains, is prescribing \u201cthe marriage cure\u201d for whatever ails us, be it inequity, dissatisfaction or loneliness, while at the same time removing policies, like legal abortion or no-fault divorce, that have allowed women to survive independently. There is increasing pressure to get married today, a political tactic that diverts attention on to the individual and away from the prospect of designing and supporting legislation around things such as housing and childcare that make the lives of single parents and people living alone easier. Doesn\u2019t it all make you want to organise a mass divorce in Parliament Square? Doesn\u2019t it make you want to burn a white dress? Marriage is one of those sticky problems for many of us, where the thing we want to do is loudly at odds with the politics we want to live. Getting married is a nice excuse to have cake, but it\u2019s also a blunt tool of the state. People can, and do, screw with the institution, reshaping it to their needs, acknowledging it\u2019s a structure that has traditionally embraced such horrors as homophobia, colonialism and capitalism before sighing and asking how it could look, and what, perhaps, it could do for them. But the vapour trails of tradition are long and cold, and the process of moving forward is often trickier than it appears. Discussing her new novel about a 40-something queer woman finding herself in a heterosexual marriage and a nuclear family (an experience that has parallels to her own life), Miranda July said yes, marriage, \u201cabsolutely can be made according to your specific circumstances and desires. But depending on where you sit in the culture and who your parents were, or are, that is either more or less available to you.\u201d If you\u2019re like her, \u201creinventing what a marriage might consist of\u2026 is kind of like painting over the Mona Lisa. It\u2019s not that hard, it\u2019s kind of exhilarating, but you think you might go to jail for it? Every second, I feel like the guards are coming.\u201d There is something particularly upsetting, I think, about the ways the state attempts to legislate love, or manipulate us into relationships that can be more easily controlled. At times it is tempting to twist the politics to suit our romance and get married at least partly so that we can grab the small securities our government offers. For those who are single though, or feeling pressure to conform, this \u201cperiod of marital revivalism\u201d provides an opportunity to think about what we might really be searching for in marriage, whether legitimacy, a big dress or a sense of belonging, and see where else it might be found. And if it\u2019s simply a party, it\u2019s worth remembering that all you really need for that is a decent speaker and an Iceland prawn ring.

    "description": "State Water Resources Control Board calls for sharp reductions in diversions from Sacramento River and its tributaries.",
    "content": "California\u2019s water warriors have a new arena for their perpetual conflict over the allocation of the state\u2019s ever-evolving supply \u2013 a nearly 6,000-word proposal from the state Water Resources Control Board. The draft essentially calls for sharp reductions in diversions from the Sacramento River and its tributaries to allow more water to flow through the environmentally troubled Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. \u201cIt is a consequential effort,\u201d Eric Oppenheimer, chief deputy director of the board, said during a media briefing on what is technically an update of the agency\u2019s management plan for the Delta and San Francisco Bay. \u201cIt reflects years of scientific analysis that we\u2019ve undertaken and years of public input.\u201d The board had previously issued a similar policy paper for the San Joaquin River and its tributaries. The two rivers merge to form the Delta, a vast maze of islands and channels that is the West Coast\u2019s largest estuary. In addition to upstream diversions to irrigate fields and orchards and serve municipal users, federal and state projects pump water from the Delta\u2019s southern edge into aqueducts for transfer to San Joaquin Valley farms and homes as far south as San Diego. The reduction of natural flows through the Delta have, scientists say, increased its salinity and otherwise made it unable to adequately support salmon and other wildlife. The battle over the Delta has raged for decades with environmental groups, lately joined by American Indian tribes, pressing the water board to impose reductions on diversions, and water users seeking to protect their supplies. There are, in the macro sense, two conflicts: how much additional flows are needed to restore the Delta and how any reduction in diversions would be framed and enforced. The water board\u2019s new draft provides some additional focus on both, but doesn\u2019t provide any solid direction. For the better part of a decade, two governors, Jerry Brown and Gavin Newsom, have promoted the concept of \u201cvoluntary agreements\u201d to reduce diversions, hoping to avoid a head-on political and legal collision. \u201cWe want to thank Gov. Newsom for his continued leadership and commitment to using collaborative voluntary agreements between water users and public agencies to support water quality and fish populations throughout the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta,\u201d Farm Bureau president Jamie Johansson said in response to the new plan. However, the water agencies have offered, in the main, much smaller reductions than the water board says are necessary to improve habitat. The environmental coalitions demanding larger reductions see the voluntary agreements as subterfuges to maintain the status quo and have pressed the board to simply set reduction numbers and enforce them by decree. \u201cVoluntary agreements serve as backroom deals that continue to leave tribes, environmental justice communities, conservation groups, fishing communities, and other vital stakeholders out of the government-led planning process,\u201d the Restore the Delta coalition responded. Imposing reductions would touch off a legal battle that Brown and Newsom have wanted to avoid because it would hinge on water rights, some of which date back to the late 19th century. Environmentalists contend that those rights are anachronisms in the 21st century and should be set aside to give authorities the ability to allocate water rationally, particularly since climate change is affecting precipitation and thus the overall water supply. However, when the water board tested its authority vis-\u00e0-vis ordering diversion reductions from senior water rights holders, it lost in court. Moreover, legislation that would have provided such authority didn\u2019t make it through the Legislature this year, thanks to stiff opposition from farmers and other rights holders. The water board\u2019s new draft may provide more grist for debate, but it does not resolve the fundamental conflicts.",

    "content": "Early riser? Not a willing one. I wake about 5.30am. I\u2019m constantly operating on four hours\u2019 sleep. First thing? Telly in bed. I watch Totally Bonkers Guinness World Records . It\u2019s hilarious and ridiculous \u2013 things like the farthest tightrope walk in high heels. I\u2019ve always wanted a go. Breakfast? Nothing except a coffee\u2026 despite what dieticians say. The earlier I eat, the more calories I can ram in. If I had breakfast, I\u2019d be the size of my house. What\u2019s next? A walk with mates. We walk through the park for half an hour and go to a cafe for three hours. We used to do Saturdays, but there\u2019s a parkrun and we got in the way. There was huffing and puffing and \u2018Oh, for God\u2019s sake\u2026\u2019 behind us. Lunch? Carrot shavings and linseeds. A salad(ish). I\u2019d rather eat later in the day. How do you relax? The Sunday papers. I\u2019ll intersperse them with a book. I loved I\u2019m Sorry You Feel That Way by Rebecca Wait. I love telly. I\u2019m slightly obsessed, because my mum was a bit puritanical about it and only let us watch documentaries on scaffolding and stuff like that. Sunday wardrobe? Same as every day: something black that looks like a sack. Sunday soundtrack? My mum and dad used to listen to classical music on Sunday. I\u2019ve got into that habit. I dip into Elaine Paige on Sunday, too. And my daughters introduced me to Lorde and Keaton Henson. In the evening? It could be midnight when I put out the light or half two. I\u2019ll start watching gruesome medical shows at one in the morning. Worst Sunday? My best friend\u2019s dad was the local vicar. I was expected to go to church with her and managed to swerve that by becoming a bellringer. If you don\u2019t catch the sally, that furry bit, when it comes down, it whips around the bell tower. And if you don\u2019t let go, you go up with it. I went up with the bell rope once. I was at least 12ft in the air by the time I remembered to let go. I was only 11 at the time. It was quite a landing. The Great British Bake Off: an Extra Slice is on Channel 4 on Thursdays at 8pm",

    "description": "While lots of huge AAA games have already come out in October 2023, you shouldn't miss these three other games that also came out this week.",
    "content": "Heading into October, it was no secret that this month was going to be one of the most hectic ever for video games. Several notable game franchises are receiving brand new entries; this week alone saw the arrival of a new Assassin\u2019s Creed game and the opening of early access for Forza Motorsport . Still, these flashy AAA games are far from the only ones to be coming out right now, and even just eight days into the month, we recognize that some fantastic games have already flown under the radar. Contents The Lamplighters League Wargroove 2 Silent Hope Particularly for those who like games that force them to think strategically, the first week of October featured three new games that haven\u2019t gotten the attention of Forza Motorsport and Assassin\u2019s Creed Mirage , but still deserve it: Silent Hope, The Lamplighters League , and Wargroove 2 . These are three solid games that are worth a play while you\u2019re waiting for Spider-Man and Mario. Recommended Videos The Lamplighters League Paradox Interactive Did you know that Harebrained Schemes, the developer behind fantastic strategy RPGs like the Shadowrun Trilogy and Battletech , put out a new game this week? Well, on October 3, the studio dropped The Lamplighters League , a supernatural strategy game inspired by the pulpy stories of the early 1900s. That\u2019s reflected in the game\u2019s cartoonish art style and charismatic voice acting, which I found very charming. Related The best indie hidden gems of 2022: 10 excellent games you can\u2019t miss Don\u2019t miss out on these great games from early 2022 When it comes to gameplay, it\u2019ll be familiar to those who played Harebrained\u2019s previous games or the XCOM series. Players can sneak around in real time between fights. During those segments, they can explore, take in more of the world and lore, properly position their soldiers, and even pick off some enemies before an encounter begins using each character\u2019s unique abilities. This setup makes The Lamplighters League\u2019s missions more intense and sprawling than its peers. Although it\u2019s not revelatory for the strategy game genre, it makes you feel like the mastermind behind an eclectic team of spies outsmarting overwhelming forces working against them. While many of this month\u2019s biggest releases are fast-paced, action-focused romps, The Lamplighters League will make you stop, think cleverly, and soundly execute smart tactical strategies to complete a mission with as few mishaps or casualties as possible. The Lamplighters League is now available for PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S. It\u2019s also available via Xbox Game Pass. Wargroove 2 Chucklefish Next, there\u2019s Wargroove 2 , released by Chucklefish on October 5. While it\u2019s also a strategy game like The Lamplighters League , it approaches the idea differently. Advance Wars is the inspiration here, rather than XCOM; the original Wargroove came out when the Advance Wars series was MIA, and a strategy game genre truly needed a game like it. The fact that Advance Wars 1+2: Re-Boot Camp launched earlier this year seemed like it could reduce the necessity of a game like Wargroove 2, but that\u2019s not the case. Wargroove 2 is a deep and engaging strategy game that emphasizes terrain and the tactical relationship between standard units and powerful Commander ones, which are active on the field in this game. Commanders are strong, buff certain units standing near them, and have powerful Groove abilities, like forcibly moving enemies from one space to another, which opens up new combat strategies. You have to be careful not to overextend these Commander units and minimize damage taken by trying to fight on terrain that buffs your unit\u2019s defense. This becomes even more important in Conquest, the game\u2019s roguelike mode, where players move along choice-filled paths of tactical challenges, collecting new units and abilities while trying to keep everyone healthy along the way. Conquest gives Wargroove 2 a sense of endless replay value, which works well in a genre that\u2019s all about mastering mechanics to develop the best strategies. Instead of just a mission in The Lamplighters League , you could be fitting whole Conquest runs between other games for the rest of the year. Wargroove 2 is available now for PC and Nintendo Switch. Silent Hope XSEED Games Finally, there\u2019s Silent Hope for those who just want to fully immerse themselves in a roguelike experience with lots of replay value. Released on October 3 by Marvelous and XSEED, this is a roguelite set in a world where no one but a Princess encased in a giant teardrop can speak. After seven heroes manifest from crystals, they work with the Princess to delve into a giant abyss and search for the king trapped at the bottom of this abyss. In practice, that all means players must venture through the abyss across multiple runs as one of seven character class archetypes, fighting enemies and gathering resources to improve the character\u2019s stats and chances at survival incrementally each time. Although its combat and story aren\u2019t as slick as something like Hades, Silent Hope features a cute and welcoming quirk and charm that could only come from a Japanese developer. It sticks to the core gameplay loop that makes roguelikes immensely enjoyable, while infusing a lot of charm into the world and visuals. While other games this month might be much more ambitious or refined, something as simple as a good roguelike will be just as entertaining in the few quieter moments nestled throughout the rest of 2023\u2019s release calendar. Silent Hope is available across PC and Nintendo Switch. A free demo will give you a solid feel for all of its basic gameplay systems and loops, letting you play through the first area as much as you want, so that alone should be worth a download. Editors' Recommendations Don\u2019t miss this free Epic Games Store gem from the creators of Fall Guys Don\u2019t lock in your \u2018game of the year\u2019 list yet. 2022 is far from over Please don\u2019t let Insomniac turn into Marvel\u2019s video game studio",

The answer is simple. If the culture continues to ...

The answer seems obvious\u2013simple, even\u2013but it\u2019s not. So what\u2019s the answer? If people continue to overlook age bias, stereotyping and discrimination, then every younger person risks aging into it. Ageism affects our health and longevity by as many as 7.5 years . It harms our financial well-being. Plus, ageism takes a toll on emotional and mental health. Researcher and aging expert Becca Levy concluded the 1-year cost of ageism was $63 billion in health-related expenses. In the workplace, olders face longer periods of unemployment when displaced from a job, and they find it increasingly difficult to move from one position to the next. They face hiring discrimination and report fewer professional development opportunities and promotions. When older people are not allowed to work, it takes a toll on the economy. In the U.S. it is estimated that $850 billion in lost gains to the Gross Domestic Product due to involuntary retirement, underemployment, and unemployment among older workers. Moreover, when older job seekers can\u2019t find work, they often draw down their savings or are forced to take early retirement benefits, impacting their lifelong financial subsidies.

It\u2019s A Tactic From 1973. WWE Fastlane 2023 Results: Cody Rhodes And Jey Uso Win Tag Team Titles According to the Department of Housing and Urban Development, older adults are the fastest-growing segment of the homeless population . Workers 55 and older made up nearly 20% of those living in homeless shelters in 2021, and thousands more live in their cars or on the street. \u201cThe fact that we are seeing elderly homelessness is something that we have not seen since the Great Depression,\u201d Dennis Culhane, a University of Pennsylvania professor, told the New York Times. Without employment opportuntities older workers are left particularly vulnerable. Ageism Results in Loss The economy created 119,000 more jobs in September than previously reported in July and August, according to Reuters, with payroll gains almost double the 170,000 forecast. Unemployment remains unchanged from the previous month at 3.8%. Most recently, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported the number of job openings had increased to 9.6 million. The bottom line is that there are plenty of job vacancies but few opportunities for older workers. Lack of employment opportunities directly impacts the financial security of people over 50. The question is, what, if anything, will be done? Case Study for Malaysia An aging population is defined as one in which those aged 65 years and above make up at least 15 percent of the total population. In 2022, the share of the Malaysian population aged over 65 years was at 7.5 percent, but the country expects to reach 15 percent by 2030. The country has slowly increased the retirement age from 55 in 2001 to 60 in 2012. Now they are looking to extend it to 65. Malaysia also offered a two-year tax incentive in 2020 and 2021 for employers who hired workers 65 and older. In comparison, the percentage of the U.S. population of over 65 in 2022 was 17.13\u2013well over the aging population definition. There are no tax incentives for employers to hire older workers. Moreover, older workers already drawing social security are penalized for earning more than $14,250 annually as a single filer and must pay taxes on up to 85% of their social security benefits . Legislation meant to strengthen protections for older job applicants in the U.S. was passed by the House in 2021 but sat in a Senate committee without action. Do 20- and 30-Year-Olds \u201cGet\u201d Ageism? Any younger person who has seen an older parent struggle to find employment surely gets ageism. But not every younger person understands what\u2019s at stake. Sophie Schmitt, Founder and CEO at Seniosphere Conseil in Paris, asked a room full of graduate students at a prestigious French business school if they knew what ageism was. To her surprise, not a single hand went up. Sophie Schmitt on ageism Linkedin Ageism is not confined to the U.S., it is a global challenge. In Europe, one out of two people are ageist, according the the United Nations and World Health Organization. Everyone deserves the right to work and receive equitable wages, no matter what their age or where they live.

    "description": "Tourists at the Acropolis this holiday season can witness the resolution of one of the world's most heated debates on cultural heritage.",
    "content": "Tourists at the Acropolis this holiday season can witness the resolution of one of the world's most heated debates on cultural heritage. All they need is a smartphone. Visitors can now pinch and zoom their way around the ancient Greek site, with a digital overlay showing how it once looked. That includes a collection of marble sculptures removed from the Parthenon more than 200 years ago that are now on display at the British Museum in London. Greece has demanded they be returned. For now, an app supported by Greece's Culture Ministry allows visitors to point their phones at the Parthenon temple, and the sculptures housed in London appear back on the monument as archaeologists believe they looked 2,500 years ago. Other, less widely known features also appear: Many of the sculptures on the Acropolis were painted in striking colors. A statue of goddess Athena in the main chamber of the Parthenon also stood over a shallow pool of water. \"That's really impressive ... the only time I've seen that kind of technology before is at the dentist,\" Shriya Parsotam Chitnavis, a tourist from London, said after checking out the app on a hot afternoon at the hilltop Acropolis, Greece's most popular archaeological site. \"I didn't know much about the (Acropolis), and I had to be convinced to come up here. Seeing this has made it more interesting\u2014seeing it in color,\" she said. \"I'm more of a visual person, so this being interactive really helped me appreciate it.\" The virtual restoration works anywhere and could spare some visitors the crowded uphill walk and long wait to see the iconic monuments up close. It might also help the country's campaign to make Greek cities year-round destinations. Tourism, vital for the Greek economy, has roared back since the COVID-19 pandemic, even as wildfires chased visitors from the island of Rhodes and affected other areas this summer. The number of inbound visitors from January through July was up 21.9% to 16.2 million compared with a year ago, according to the Bank of Greece. Revenue was up just over 20%, to 10.3 billion euros ($10.8 billion). The app, called \"Chronos\" after the mythological king of the Titans and Greek word for \"time,\" uses augmented reality to place the ancient impression of the site onto the screen, matching the real-world view as you walk around. AR is reaching consumers after a long wait and is set to affect a huge range of professional and leisure activities. Medical surgery, and specialized machine repair as well as retail and live event experiences are all in the sights of big tech companies betting on a lucrative future in immersive services. Tech giant like Meta and Apple are that can cost thousands of dollars. The will keep the cellphone as the main AR delivery platform to consumers for some time, said Maria Engberg, co-author of the book \"Reality Media\" on augmented and . She says services for travelers will soon offer a better integrated experience, allowing for more sharing options on tours and overlaying archive photos and videos. \"AR and VR have been lagging behind other kinds of things like games and movies that we're consuming digitally,\" said Engberg, an associate professor of computer science and media technology at Malmo University in Sweden. \"I think we will see really interesting customer experiences in the next few years as more content from museums and archives becomes digitized,\" she said. Greece's Culture Ministry and national tourism authority are late but enthusiastic converts to technology. The popular video game Assassin's Creed Odyssey, which allows players to roam ancient Athens, was used to attract young travelers from China to Greece with a state-organized photo contest. Microsoft partnered with the Culture Ministry two years ago to launch an immersive digital tour at ancient Olympia, birthplace of the Olympic Games in southern Greece. Culture Minister Lina Mendoni said the innovations would boost accessibility to Greece's ancient monuments, supplementing the recent installation of ramps and anti-slip pathways. \"Accessibility is extending to the digital space,\" Mendoni said at a preview launch event for the Chronos app in May. \"Real visitors and virtual visitors anywhere around the world can share historical knowledge.\" Developed by Greek telecoms provider Cosmote, the free app's designers say they hope to build on existing features that include an artificial intelligence-powered virtual guide, Clio. \"As technologies and networks advance, with better bandwidth and lower latencies, will be able to download even higher-quality content,\" said Panayiotis Gabrielides, a senior official at the telecom company involved in the project. Virtual reconstructions using Chronos also cover three other monuments at the Acropolis, an adjacent Roman theater and parts of the Acropolis Museum built at the foot of the rock. \u00a9 2023 The Associated Press.

    "description": "Patrick Mahomes said watching Tom Brady thrive in the NFL until he was 45 years old motivated him to take care of his bodily longevity and increase his focus on nutrition.",
    "content": "Tom Brady concluded his illustrious NFL career at 45 years old after spending an unprecedented 23 seasons playing professional football . The legendary quarterback has inspired countless athletes to follow in his footsteps; stars across sports hope to increase the longevity of their careers by training, eating, sleeping, and thinking like the seven-time Super Bowl champion . Patrick Mahomes , the superstar Kansas City Chiefs quarterback long billed as Brady's successor, is no exception. In an episode of the Netflix docu-series \"Quarterback,\" Mahomes \u2014 a two-time Super Bowl champion and two-time league MVP in his own right \u2014 said he realized the importance of bodily upkeep while watching Brady dominate the NFL into his mid 40s. \"People really started recognizing that with Tom Brady,\" Mahomes said. \"And how much he takes care of his body, and why he's still playing until he's 45 years old.\" \" To me, I saw that and I was like: 'I need to take my game to the next level.'\" Though he hasn't yet reached the avocado-ice-cream-as-a-treat level of commitment to healthy eating Brady long touted, Mahomes has devoted more of his attention to diet and nutrition than he once did. The 28-year-old eats four or five meals per day to avoid consuming too much in one sitting. He tries to load up on fruits, vegetables, and proteins while cutting back on fast and fried foods. Mahomes is also incredibly committed to his fitness regimen. After working with his trainer, Bobby Stroupe, since his elementary school days in Texas, he convinced the Athlete Performance Enhancement Center (APEC) founder to move to Kansas City and work with him in a full-time capacity. The pair work together three days per week during the season \u2014 in addition to regular practices with the Chiefs \u2014 \"just to make sure I can have my body in the best position possible by the end of the season to play my best football,\" Mahomes explained in the episode. \"We train to be able to move in as many ways as possible,\" Stroupe said. \"I believe in armoring the body in different movements to make sure that you are prepared to go where you don't wanna go.

    "content": "The new Star Wars series made history with its female cast, but failed to live up to the hype. Admittedly, had a lot working against it. It never seemed prudent to continue in live-action. It\u2019d be similarly difficult for casual fans \u2014 most of whom hadn\u2019t seen a lick of or , and who only had a vague knowledge of Anakin Skywalker\u2019s erstwhile padawan \u2014 to get on board. If the of Marvel Studios projects is teaching us anything, it\u2019s that audiences don\u2019t actually want to read an explainer or watch a recap to understand what\u2019s happening in their favorite franchise. Despite its obstacles, did have an ace up its sleeve. It\u2019s the first Star Wars project with a predominantly female cast \u2014 yes, even after 40 years, 11 films, and half as many shows. Three of s protagonists are women; impressively, two are women of color. And with the addition of villains like Morgan Elsbeth and the , had a unique opportunity to center its story on the most diverse ensemble in franchise history. The series inadvertently became on that premise alone. And while Ahsoka Tano and Sabine Wren were definitely doing a lot of girl-bossing in s two-episode premiere, something still seemed off. Series creator Dave Filoni brought casual audiences up to speed with plenty of exposition, but the majority of it rested on our heroines\u2019 shoulders. It was up to Ahsoka, Sabine, and fellow alum Hera Syndulla to fill everyone in on the threat that Grand Admiral Thrawn still posed to the galaxy, the void that hero Ezra Bridger left in the Rebellion, and the shadow that Darth Vader \u2014 aka Anakin Skywalker \u2014 casts over Ahsoka\u2019s future. But sadly, wasn\u2019t exactly passing the Bechdel Test. Ahsoka and Sabine are two of the franchise\u2019s most compelling female characters, but doesn\u2019t act like it. It\u2019s not great to watch so many powerful women \u2014 some warriors, some even powerful witches \u2014 sit around talking about the men in their lives. Few conversations end without at least a mention of one (sometimes two!) of these male characters. While the first half of did well to establish tension in the dynamics between Ahsoka and Sabine, or Sabine and her rival Shin Hati, it wasn\u2019t enough to offset the series\u2019 hollow emotional core. Even before Thrawn, Ezra, or Anakin make their respective appearances in , they\u2019re still looming figures in the series. They\u2019re the very force that keeps the story moving, and each serves as motivation for s female characters. Each of our heroines are defined, in some way, by the men of their past: Hera by a loss that fans know well, Ahsoka by fear, . And that would be pretty compelling, if it served as more than just a plot device for the series. It gets worse once does add Thrawn, Ezra, and a trio of Nightsisters to the mix. Ezra doesn\u2019t feature as prominently in the final episodes, which does give Sabine a lot more room to come into her own \u2014 but Morgan Elsbeth and the Nightsisters essentially exist to do Thrawn\u2019s bidding. Even Shin Hati is attached to her master, Baylon Skoll; until he leaves her high and dry in Episode 7, she mostly serves as his sounding board and occasional attack dog. Morgan Elsbeth and the Nightsisters are some of the coolest villains in Star Wars history, but they don\u2019t get many chances to stand on their own. This wouldn\u2019t be the first time a Star Wars story used women to prop up male characters. While Leia Organa is a welcome exception \u2014 despite being \u201cthe girl\u201d on an all-men crew \u2014 the franchise has yet to match her strong characterization since. The prequels had Padm\u00e9 Amidala, a formidable politician that became a pawn in Emperor Palpatine\u2019s nefarious scheme. had Jyn Erso \u2014 a fierce warrior with plenty of pathos, but one that was defined by her relationship to her estranged father (and was, once again, surrounded by dudes). The list goes on: from to the sequels, no Star Wars story has really managed to create a strong female ensemble, or give any female character a real sense of autonomy. might come closer than any live-action project has before, though it still falls short of the substance that its characters deserve. Some of the series\u2019 best moments manifest in duels between Morgan Elsbeth and Ahsoka, or Shin Hati and Sabine. In those brief match-ups, no one is thinking about their responsibility to their respective master. No one\u2019s talking about it, either. It certainly fuels their motivation, but the winning or losing is the only thing that matters in the moment. If only moment in had that same sense of urgency. The series did have its work cut out for it, but it also had a whole lot of potential. In some ways, it did succeed in bringing animated stories into live-action, but it did so at great cost to its most interesting characters. Their adventures will continue in future Star Wars stories; hopefully with a bit less emphasis on the past and more on their futures.",

If none of the above is really resonating, don\u2019t worry. The main narrative of mostly serves as a set-up for the game\u2019s grimdark setting and mission structure, and it\u2019s easily the least interesting aspect. Where the game shines, however, is in its minute-to-minute gameplay and character interactions. is developed by Fatshark, the same studio behind the Vermintide games, and it bears a lot of similarities. Instead of pre-set characters, you have four classes to choose from: Veteran, Zealot, Ogryn, and Psyker. These classes all fulfill different roles. For example, Ogryn is a heavy melee tank while Psyker is a power-based class. However, there\u2019s a deep level of customization in that really lets you fine-tune each class however you want. makes good use of the grimdark Warhammer setting to ratchet up the tension. received a massive update at the beginning of October, which completely overhauls the class system and makes its skill trees much more robust and dynamic. Many of these changes let you lean even further into specific builds like a veteran kitted out for close-quarter shotgun combat. This focus on builds integrally changes the esque experience, making it more important than ever that you learn how to work as a team and how different classes might play off one another. Of course, the other reason teamwork is so vital is due to enemy design, and is a masterclass in that respect. has over a dozen unique enemy types, and the varying difficulty can throw anything your way at any time, meaning you always need to be on your toes. There are five different difficulty levels to choose from, which scale things like enemy damage and the amount of spawns. From there, your character level factors into your own strength and abilities. Past that, the random nature of enemy types means you might run into a surprise or two. For example, the chainsaw-wielding Mauler might disrupt your formation and force you to split up and fall back. Meanwhile, bosses like the Daemonhost can bring you to a screeching halt as you try to stealth around, lest you incur their sorcerous wrath. There\u2019s an ebb and flow to the encounters in , see-sawing between nail-biting adrenaline and quiet exploration. Interspersed in these changes are loads of little character interactions, like snippets of dialogue that add a lot to the characters and lore.

This, combined with the way the game mixes up enemy placements and types, helps make each match feel different and distinct, something -style shooters sometimes struggle with. Even if the main story feels like it goes nowhere, there are still interesting backstories and personalities to discover for each character. Since its launch in November 2022, Fatshark has been diligent about updating and listening to the community. A lot of the stingy progression has been ironed out with the class overhaul. The shooting and combat already felt fantastic, and now it has the systems in place to back that core gameplay up. If the Warhammer series seems impenetrable to get into, is a great place to start because of the way it centers co-op. Whether you\u2019ve got a squad ready to go or you\u2019re jumping into matchmaking, is one of the tightest horde shooters in years, and it\u2019ll likely only get even better over time.",

    "description": "Some researchers are questioning the strength of the evidence against ultra-processed foods.",
    "content": "Ultra-processed foods are taking up more and more space in global conversations about public health and nutrition. From breakfast cereals and protein bars to flavored yogurt and frozen pizzas, ultra-processed foods are everywhere, filling aisle upon aisle at the supermarket. Fully of the calories consumed by adults and of those consumed by children in the United States are made up of these highly palatable foodstuffs with their highly manipulated ingredients. And ultra-processed foods are not just filling our plates; they\u2019re also taking up more and more space in global conversations about public health and nutrition. In the last decade or so, researchers have ramped up efforts to define ultra-processed foods and to probe how their consumption correlates to health: A wave of recent studies have linked the foods to heightened risk for conditions ranging from cardiovascular disease and cancer to obesity and depression. Still, some researchers \u2014 and perhaps unsurprisingly, industry representatives \u2014 question the strength of the evidence against ultra-processed foods. The category is too poorly defined, and the studies too circumstantial, they say. Plus, labeling such a large portion of our grocery carts as unhealthy ignores the benefits of industrial food processing in making food affordable, safe from foodborne pathogens, easy to prepare, and in some cases, more sustainable \u2014 such as through the development of designed to replace meat and milk. \u201cYou cannot throw the baby out with the bathwater and decide that you\u2019re going to just dump everything\u201d that\u2019s ultra-processed, says Ciar\u00e1n Forde, a sensory science and eating behavior researcher at Wageningen University in the Netherlands and coauthor of a . As the debate about ultra-processed foods roils on, one path forward is to invest in understanding the mechanisms by which ultra-processed foods affect health. If the foods are indeed harmful, what about them \u2014 what features? \u2014 makes them so, and why? Through feeding volunteers carefully formulated diets and watching their consumption behavior, researchers can identify the qualities that make these foods both so appealing and so unhealthful, they say. Such studies could help to pinpoint the most harmful types of ultra-processed foods \u2014 ones that might be targeted with warning labels and other policies \u2014 and guide companies in tweaking their recipes to produce more healthful options. \u201cI think the biological mechanisms are really important both to strengthen the evidence, but also to find solutions,\u201d says Filippa Juul, a nutritional epidemiologist at New York University. That said, Juul adds she thinks there\u2019s already enough evidence about the harms of ultra-processed foods to recommend that people eat less of them. To study ultra-processed foods, researchers must be able to define them, and even this is contentious. Food preparation involves processes like grinding, cooking, fermenting, and pasteurizing \u2014 methods that have long been used to make foods safer and more digestible, palatable, and storable. But according to the most widely used classification system, called NOVA, ultra-processed foods are distinguished by additional industrial techniques, like hydrolysis, hydrogenation, and extrusion, and with ingredients like emulsifiers, thickeners, flavors, and other additives that are rarely found in home kitchens. Most of the evidence that ultra-processed foods are harmful comes from observational studies in which participants are asked about the foods they eat and have their health tracked over time. These studies have consistently found that people who ate more ultra-processed foods were more likely to develop , , , , , , and diseases of the gastrointestinal tract such as , as well as to during the course of the studies. Such observational studies can\u2019t prove that ultra-processed foods caused these health problems, in part because other factors in people\u2019s lives could account for their greater risk of illness and death, Juul says. In the United States, for example, people who eat more ultra-processed foods also tend to have and to live in , and unmeasured factors such as stress, sleep, and exposure to racism and weight bias could confound the correlation between food processing and health. However, Juul adds, the association between ultra-processed foods and poor health is remarkably consistent in research from around the world. And though ultra-processed foods often have poor nutritional profiles \u2014 containing more sugar, sodium, and saturated fat than their minimally processed counterparts \u2014 that\u2019s not the whole story: Studies that have adjusted for differences in nutritional quality have found . \u201cThere seems to be something else about these foods; it\u2019s not just about the nutrients,\u201d Juul says. Unlike observational studies, randomized controlled trials can provide direct evidence that a particular diet causes health issues, but so far, only one of this type has been published. In the tightly controlled study, led by National Institutes of Health nutrition and metabolism scientist Kevin Hall and published in 2019, 20 participants lived at a clinical center for one month and were offered either minimally processed foods or ultra-processed foods for two weeks, then the other for two weeks. The meals were matched for overall calories, carbohydrates, sugar, fiber, fat, protein, and salt, and participants were told they could eat as much or as little as they liked. During two weeks on the ultra-processed diet, participants ate an average of 508 more calories per day and gained about two pounds, the study found; during two weeks on the minimally processed diet, they lost about the same amount. That result was surprising to Hall, who had predicted that the level of processing wouldn't matter since the two diets had similar nutrient levels. It also raised new questions: What is it about ultra-processed foods that make us eat more? And do all ultra-processed foods have similar effects on us? The answer to the second question is probably not, Hall says. For example, in a , overall intake of ultra-processed food correlated with a greater risk of type 2 diabetes, but some food types \u2014 including cereals, whole grain breads, yogurt, and dairy-based desserts like ice cream \u2014 were linked with a lower risk. Hall says it will take a lot more research to figure out which subcategories of ultra-processed foods are unhealthy and why; different mechanisms may underlie different maladies. A long list of mechanisms could contribute, adds Juul \u2014 such as food additives that affect the microbiome, the foods' rapid and easy digestibility, chemicals absorbed from packaging, or the displacement of healthy foods from the diet. \"It's likely a combination of all of these things,\" she says. If people outside of lab settings eat about 500 extra calories per day on an ultra-processed diet, as they did in Hall's 2019 study, it could help to explain why obesity rates have grown in recent decades, he believes. Hall is now focused on understanding why ultra-processed foods would drive us to do this. One possible explanation is energy density or the number of calories per gram of food. In Hall's 2019 NIH trial, for example, energy density was higher for the ultra-processed foods, primarily because they contained less water, than for the minimally processed foods. has shown that people tend to consume more calories when they eat energy-dense foods, perhaps because the foods are less physically filling to the gastrointestinal tract and allow for more calories to be consumed in a shorter amount of time, interfering with normal satiety signaling. When Hall and colleagues at 2,733 meals served in two NIH trials comparing different types of diets, they found that energy density was one of the most important determinants of calorie intake within a given meal. Hall and colleagues also saw in the study that participants ate more when they were offered foods containing greater amounts of certain pairs of nutrients \u2014 fat and sugar, fat and , or carbohydrates and sodium \u2014 than are found in nature or in whole foods. Such foods are \u201chyper-palatable,\u201d explains Tera Fazzino, a behavioral psychologist at the University of Kansas who the term. Hyperpalatable foods have been shown in animal and human studies to excessively activate reward-sensing circuits in the brain, and it\u2019s more difficult to stop eating them, she says. That\u2019s different from the way we enjoy other foods, Fazzino adds. An apple, for example, contains naturally occurring sugars that make it pleasant to eat, but it\u2019s not hyperpalatable because it doesn\u2019t also contain lots of fat. In a similar manner, many of the foods that Fazzino enjoys when she visits family in Italy, such as fish lightly seasoned with olive oil and salt and biscotti made with butter and a touch of sugar, leave her feeling perfectly satisfied, she says. In contrast, it can feel like an act of resistance to stop eating hyper-palatable foods, such as the many packaged snack foods formulated with tasty combinations of carbohydrate, fat, and salt, Fazzino says. And that\u2019s a worry because Fazzino\u2019s research indicates that from 49 percent in 1988 to 69 percent in 2018. At the NIH, Hall is currently running another clinical trial to try to tease apart the contributions of energy density and hyper palatability to how much food people eat. In this study, participants will try four different diets, all matched for nutrient levels, for one week each. One is minimally processed. The other three are ultra-processed and either dense in calories or hyperpalatable, or both. In the Netherlands, meanwhile, eating behavior researcher Forde is focused on yet another food characteristic to explain the greater calorie intake of ultra-processed foods: texture. Many ultra-processed foods are \u201ceffectively prechewed when they arrive on your plate because they\u2019re softly textured,\u201d Forde says \u2014 and that makes them easier to eat more quickly. Research by Forde and others has found that people eat meals with harder textures more slowly. In a recent trial, participants consumed . Calorie intake was lowest of all when people ate a meal that was both hard-textured and minimally processed. Forde\u2019s group is now planning a randomized controlled trial, funded in part by food companies, that will test participants\u2019 intake of two different ultra-processed diets for two weeks. Forde predicts that people will eat more of the \u201cfast diet,\u201d which is soft in texture, than the \u201cslow diet,\u201d which has been designed to have harder textures. Other researchers are looking at ultra-processed foods from the perspective of . Because we can eat these foods quickly, and they often lack much structure or fiber to slow their digestion, they deliver a quick dose of calories and a rewarding spike in the neurotransmitter dopamine to the brain, says Alexandra DiFeliceantonio, a neuroscientist who studies eating behavior at the Fralin Biomedical Research Institute at Virginia Tech Carilion. In an ongoing study, she and colleagues are giving people calorie-matched, rapidly digested sugar (\u201cfast calories\u201d) or slowly digested sugars with added fiber (\u201cslow calories\u201d) along with previously unfamiliar flavors. DiFeliceantonio hypothesizes that people will develop a stronger preference for the flavors paired with the fast calories. And this, she adds, could help explain why we might struggle to stop eating certain ultra-processed foods that were \u201cliterally engineered to be delicious,\u201d she says. DiFeliceantonio hopes that studies like hers will help disentangle what it is about ultra-processed foods that cause overeating and support new regulations that lead to more healthful choices. \u201cThen,\u201d she says, \u201cyou have a really strong scientific foundation for making changes in the environment and not just asking people to make changes on an individual level.\u201d Regulations might include limiting how the foods are advertised (for example, not during television shows for children) or requiring neighborhood markets to carry fresh foods in addition to packaged ones. Some public health experts say that regardless of the mechanisms, we know enough that we should be taking steps to reduce the consumption of ultra-processed foods right now. \u201cWhether they\u2019re hyperpalatable, whether they\u2019re energy-dense, whatever the cause is, the effect has been huge,\u201d says Barry Popkin, an economist and nutrition epidemiologist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Popkin points to countries that have already imposed on certain ultra-processed foods. Chile, for example, has added warning labels on the front of food packages and taxed sugary drinks; the country has also banned certain foods in schools and restricted their marketing to children \u2014 policies associated with a and . More than , covering about 20 percent of the world\u2019s population, now because of their effects on health, and many other countries, including Israel, Canada, Brazil, and Mexico, are adding warning labels to unhealthy foods, Popkin says. Forde worries that such policies will only make food more expensive and slow progress in developing more sustainable foods. It would be more productive, he says, to encourage food companies to leverage their processing technologies to make healthier products. (Forde sits on an advisory council of Kerry Group, a food and ingredient company.) They could use food-processing techniques to reduce the caloric density of foods or incorporate more texture so that people eat a bit slower, he says. \u201cIf processing is the problem, processing is also by far the best solution we currently have,\u201d he adds. Hall would also like to see food scientists work with nutrition scientists to take on this challenge. Take a chicken nugget, for example. By adding a bit of fiber and tweaking the salt and fat content, skilled food scientists might be able to make it less energy-dense and remove its hyperpalatable qualities, he says. Whether people will still want to eat such a nugget remains to be seen.",

    "content": "Denver\u2019s largest infill project, Denargo Market, plans to develop land that has stood empty for years north of downtown, create a stronger connection between the South Platte River and the Brighton Boulevard corridor, and provide the River North Art District neighborhood with its tallest buildings. But rather than throwing up apartments as quickly as possible to generate rents, developers Golub & Co. and Formativ are leading with public improvements, including four acres of open space and other community amenities near the river that are expected to open in the summer of 2025. \u201cDeveloping 17 acres of prime riverfront space here in Denver is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and the culmination of years of development work in this area for our team,\u201d said Sean Campbell, CEO of Formativ. \u201cThis is the largest infill taking shape in Denver right now, and it will be a game changer for inclusivity in our city.\u201d Denargo Market represents a $1.5 billion investment, with about a 10th of that dedicated to the public parts of the project, Campbell said. It will be mixed-use in the full sense of the word, with residential, office, retail and a hotel planned on 17 acres of land that a decade ago served as the gathering place for produce vendors feeding Denverites. Although Brighton Boulevard and the RiNo neighborhood have plentiful retail and restaurant options with more coming, earlier developments at Denagro Market, near Arkins Court and Denargo Street, didn\u2019t include ground-floor retail. The nearest place to grab anything is a 7-11 on Broadway and 31st Street, something Campbell said the project plans to rectify with 80,000 square feet of retail that will stay active day and night. \u201cWe all want a city that is vibrant,\u201d Denver Mayor Mike Johnston said during a groundbreaking ceremony on Sept. 28. \u201cThat means that it is active, engaged, where people are present and enjoying all the city has to offer. Denargo Market will add that vibrancy to this neighborhood and to downtown.\u201d Denargo Market residents will be able to reach downtown or other parts of River North on foot or by bike and they will have plentiful public spaces to gather and play right outside their doors, he said. The development further opens up the South Platte River, long hidden in many places, to the larger community. Among the public amenities are a new sports court, a revamped dog park, a pedestrian plaza, a half-acre great lawn and splash pad, a community garden and what is expected to be one of the city\u2019s largest public art installations. Denver Parks & Recreation is working on improving the parcels directly along the river. Campbell pledged that Denargo Market would not only become a place where people would want to work and live but also a place where residents of other neighborhoods would want to spend their nights and weekends. Although the project is focusing on its public amenities first, that strategy isn\u2019t completely altruistic. For starters, the land is on a former landfill and needs extensive environmental remediation, said Laura Newman, vice president of investment and development at Golub, which is based out of Chicago. Utilities, stormwater systems and new streets are needed, and those take time. Completing those \u201chorizontal\u201d improvements will buy more time for demand in the market for \u201c . Heavy debt burdens, high interest rates and excess supply have put commercial real estate markets under intense stress right now. Waiting out the down cycle and popping back on the other side with something new and fresh should work in favor of Denargo Market. Take demand for office space, which is down substantially since employers sent workers home during the pandemic. Chipotle once considered the site for a new campus and office space remains a key offering at Denargo Market. Of the total of 3 million square feet Denver approved, campus-like office opportunities ranging from 200,000 square feet to 1.5 million square feet are being marketed. Denargo Market will also include more than 1,000 residential units. The development was grandfathered ahead of the passage of the city\u2019s Inclusionary Housing Ordinance, which required developers of larger projects to set aside 8% to 12% of their units as affordable. Denver had around 24,000 new apartment applications in the first and second quarters of 2022, but in the second quarter of this year, applications for only 70 units were submitted, noted Marty Roth, a senior vice president with CBRE specializing in land services, in a recent gather of commercial real estate brokers last month. Denver will see a glut of apartments followed by a dearth, Roth predicted. If it gets the timing right, Denargo Market could land on the right side of that curve. Golub and Formativ donated land for a building with 56 units of affordable housing designated for teenagers who age out of the state\u2019s foster care system and find themselves homeless. Pennrose will develop the community and Boulder-based TGTHR will provide services to help homeless youth aged 18 to 24. \u201cStarting with the public realm improvements and the incredible affordable housing project with TGTHR was intentional; this ensures Denargo Market will be a sustainable place that welcomes everyone in our city to live, work, and play,\u201d Newman said. Once the public improvements near completion, in early 2025, Golub and Formativ plan to break ground on a 16-story, 380-unit apartment building near the intersection of Denargo and Delgancy streets with 4,000 square feet of ground-floor retail.",

    "description": "Nearly a year after it was announced, AMD's FSR 3 is here. But it feels like yet another promise for what the feature could be in the future.",
    "content": "Square Enix This story is part of Jacob Roach's ReSpec series, covering the world of PC gaming and hardware. AMD\u2019s FidelityFX Super Resolution 3 is available after nearly a year of waiting. The company announced the feature around November of last year, in a swift response to Nvidia\u2019s, at the time, new Deep Learning Super Sampling 3 ( DLSS 3 ). AMD\u2019s pitch was simple. The company was going to deliver the same performance-multiplying feature that generates frames instead of rendering them, and it would work with any graphics card. Contents Where are the games? The compromise Hurry up and wait Now it\u2019s here, and on paper, FSR 3 does exactly what AMD claimed. It\u2019s clear AMD has a lot more work to do to make FSR 3 work properly, though. And after almost a year of waiting for the feature to arrive, it\u2019s hard betting on promises for what FSR 3 could be in the future. Recommended Videos Where are the games? EA There are so many great games for FSR 3 to debut in. AMD launched the feature in two games that were released this year: Forspoken and Immortals of Aveum. Both launched to a critical and commercial \u201cmeh\u201d from the gaming community. Forspoken saw some attention at launch, in an otherwise dull time of the year, while Immortals of Aveum never reached above a peak player count of 1,000 on Steam. Related AMD might still have some next-gen GPUs left in the tank \u2014 but I don\u2019t buy it Where in the world are all of AMD\u2019s next-gen laptop GPUs? AMD\u2019s new laptop CPU is the fastest I\u2019ve seen, but you shouldn\u2019t buy it yet Regardless of what you think of these games, they are not good candidates to launch some new, game-changing tech. Contrast that with DLSS 3.5 with Ray Reconstruction , which not only launched in Cyberpunk 2077 but alongside the game\u2019s hotly anticipated 2.0 update. That\u2019s how you debut a feature that gamers will get excited about. Nvidia certainly has a dominant position in the GPU market, so it\u2019s able to do things like timing the release of a new feature alongside a major game expansion. AMD, being far from the market leader, may not have that same amount of sway with developers. Regardless, AMD has put its stamp on some of the biggest game releases this year, all of which lack FSR 3. AMD\u2019s badge shows up in Resident Evil 4, Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, The Last of Us Part One, and most recently, Lies of P. Easily the biggest miss is Starfield , especially after AMD hyped up being the \u201cPC exclusive partner\u201d for the game. All of these games are absent from AMD\u2019s list of upcoming FSR 3 games, too. The biggest title on the list is Cyberpunk 2077, but we still don\u2019t know when FSR 3 will arrive in that game. I have no doubt that FSR 3 will start showing up in more games throughout the rest of the year and into the next. That\u2019s how these rollouts work. Launching FSR 3 with Forspoken and Immortals of Aveum isn\u2019t AMD putting its best foot forward, though, especially with heavy hitters like Starfield and Star Wars Jedi: Survivor sitting on the back burner. The compromise AMD The compromise for FSR 3\u2019s lackluster support at launch seems to be AMD Fluid Motion Frames. This is not FSR 3 (at least not in name). Fluid Motion Frames is a driver-level feature available to RX 7000 and RX 6000 graphics cards that adds frame interpolation to DirectX 11 and DirectX 12 games. Both Fluid Motion Frames and FSR 3 offer frame interpolation, but FSR 3 is built into games while Fluid Motion Frames happens at the driver level. That is a very important distinction. FSR 3, built into the game engine, is part of the rendering process. Fluid Motion Frames sits on top through the driver. FSR 3 can access information in the game engine, such as motion vectors and overlays, to present a cleaner final image. Fluid Motion Frames can\u2019t. AMD has made it clear that Fluid Motion Frames is still in its early days. It\u2019s only available through a preview (beta) driver and with some strict stipulations. It makes sense that AMD took this approach because Fluid Motion Frames needs a lot of work. For starters, it doesn\u2019t always work. I\u2019d suggest watching the breakdown from Daniel Owens below for an in-depth look in Cyberpunk 2077. Essentially, Fluid Motion Frames compares two sequential frames and uses them to guess what a frame in between would look like. It just doesn\u2019t always work. As you can see in the breakdown, Fluid Motion Frames will give up if there\u2019s too large of a difference between two frames and shut itself off temporarily. This is, according to AMD\u2019s most recent patch notes, part of the design. This is NOT FSR 3. It's better! But also worse! AMD Fluid Motion Frames If you\u2019re walking in a straight line or moving around slowly, you\u2019ll see the smoothness boost Fluid Motion Frames boasts. If you\u2019re in any sort of fast motion, where you want extra smoothness the most, the feature does essentially nothing. I\u2019d argue it leads to a worse gameplay experience, too, as you\u2019re jumping between a very high and relatively low frame rate whenever you\u2019re in motion. A locked 60 frames per second (fps) looks and feels better than a frame rate constantly jumping up to 120 fps and down to 60 fps. There are other problems that AMD didn\u2019t draw attention to when it announced Fluid Motion Frames, too. For instance, Fluid Motion Frames will still attempt to interpolate frames, even when you\u2019re in menus, leading to fine text and menu selection fields spinning out into a mess of artifacts. The dealbreaker for me is the base frame rate requirements, though. AMD says you should have a base frame rate of at least 55 fps for a 1080p display, and at least 70 fps for a 1440p display for Fluid Motion Frames to work properly. What happens if you drop below that? Below, you can see Hogwarts Legacy at 4K with ray tracing turned on. Fluid Motion Frames causes this low frame rate to fall apart into a smearing mess that looks like you\u2019re playing the game in slow motion. This video is fed through Twitter\u2019s atrocious compression, but that\u2019s doing the gameplay experience a favor here if anything. Oof, AMD Fluid Motion Frames not looking so hot on the 7900 XT pic.twitter.com/Ytw49uRnMJ \u2014 Jake Roach (@ManowarElves) October 4, 2023 This is outside of what AMD recommends for the tech, but it\u2019s a good demonstration of the limitations of Fluid Motion Frames. It functions as a way to boost already high frame rates, and in a way that isn\u2019t at all consistent. It\u2019s particularly disappointing because this feature is something you can\u2019t find with an Nvidia graphics card, and it would be one of the reasons to just ship to a GPU like AMD\u2019s RX 7800 XT . As with FSR 3, I\u2019m sure AMD will continue to iterate on Fluid Motion Frames. This is still in a preview state for now, so some issues are to be expected. That\u2019s my main problem with FSR 3 and Fluid Motion Frames, though. We\u2019ve waited long enough. Hurry up and wait AMD AMD\u2019s rollout of FSR 3 reminds me of how Intel handled its first-gen Arc GPUs: the A750 and A770 . They were announced prematurely, leading to a wave of speculation, rumors of cancellation, and a build-up of lofty expectations. When the GPUs finally arrived, it was clear Intel still had a lot of work to do on its drivers, which is why we\u2019ve so commonly seen stories of Intel delivering double the performance in certain games with a driver update. The accelerated announcement led to products that arrived in a half-finished state. FSR 3 feels similar. AMD announced the feature alongside its RX 7900 XTX and RX 7900 XT , setting up a narrative that FSR 3 would be a key feature of this next generation. Nearly a year on, we have FSR 3, but it\u2019s nothing close to a key feature for AMD\u2019s current generation. We will see FSR 3 in more games, and I\u2019m hopeful Fluid Motion Frames will mature into something that\u2019s useful for AMD users. That\u2019s what we\u2019ve seen in the past with some of AMD\u2019s other software features. Even now, though, far separated from the original announcement, FSR 3 still feels like a promise more than a feature. There\u2019s a lot of potential here for FSR 3. I\u2019ve been forward about the fact that Nvidia is increasingly selling DLSS over the raw power of its GPUs, and AMD could do something similar with FSR 3. That requires careful execution with game support and features that make sense for a wide swath of gamers. Currently, FSR 3 and Fluid Motion Frames don\u2019t deliver on those fronts. I\u2019m hopeful FSR 3 and Fluid Motion Frames will get better. But my excitement for the features that started in November of last year has all but disappeared. Editors' Recommendations This \u2018Swiss Army Knife\u2019 app transformed how I play PC games The success of AMD\u2019s FSR 3 hinges on this one feature AMD isn\u2019t just copying Nvidia\u2019s homework with FSR 3 Why I leave Nvidia\u2019s game-changing tech off in most games It\u2019s time to stop trying to play games without an SSD",

    "description": "The British government's contentious policy to stem the flow of migrants faces one of its toughest challenges this week as the U.K. Supreme Court weighs whether it's lawful to send asylum-seekers to Rwanda.",
    "content": "Back Print By Brian Melley - Associated Press - Sunday, October 8, 2023 LONDON \u2014 The British government\u2019s contentious policy to stem the flow of migrants faces one of its toughest challenges this week as the U.K. Supreme Court weighs whether it\u2019s lawful to send asylum-seekers to Rwanda. The Conservative government is challenging a Court of Appeal ruling in June that said the policy intended to deter immigrants from risking their lives crossing the English Channel in small boats is unlawful because the East African country is not a safe place to send them. Three days of arguments are scheduled to begin Monday with the government arguing its policy is safe and lawyers for migrants from Vietnam, Syria, Iraq, Iran and Sudan contending it\u2019s unlawful and inhumane. The hearing comes as much of Europe and the U.S. struggle with how best to cope with migrants seeking refuge from war, violence, oppression and a warming planet that has brought devastating drought and floods. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has vowed to \u201cstop the boats\u201d as a top priority to curb unauthorized immigration. More than 25,000 people are estimated to have arrived in the U.K. by boat as of Oct. 2, which is down nearly 25% from the 33,000 that had made the crossing at the same time last year. The policy is intended to put a stop to the criminal gangs that ferry migrants across one of the world\u2019s busiest shipping lanes by making Britain an unattractive destination because of the likelihood of being given a one-way ticket to Rwanda. Consequences of the crossing have been deadly. In August, six migrants died and about 50 had to be rescued when their boat capsized after leaving the northern coast of France. In November 2021, 27 people died after their boat sank. The government claims the policy is a fair way to deal with an influx of people who arrive on U.K. shores without authorization and that Rwanda is a safe \u201cthird country\u201d \u2014 meaning it\u2019s not where they are seeking asylum from. The U.K. and Rwandan governments reached a deal more than a year ago that would send asylum-seekers to the East African country and allow them to stay there if granted asylum. So far, not a single person has been sent there as the policy has been fought over in the courts. Human rights groups have argued its inhumane to deport people more than 4,000 miles to a place they don\u2019t want to live. They have also cited Rwanda\u2019s poor human rights record, including allegations of torture and killings of government opponents. A High Court judge initially upheld the policy, saying it didn\u2019t breach Britain\u2019s obligations under the U.N. Refugee Convention or other international agreements. But that ruling was reversed by a 2-1 decision in the Court of Appeal that found that while it was not unlawful to send asylum-seekers to a safe third country, Rwanda could not be deemed safe. The government argues the Court of Appeal had no right to interfere with the lower court decision and got it wrong by concluding deportees would be endangered in Rwanda and could face the prospect of being sent back to their home country where they could face persecution. The U.K. also says that the court should have respected the government\u2019s analysis that determined Rwanda is safe and and that its government would abide by the terms of the agreement to protect migrants\u2019 rights. Attorneys for the migrants argue that there is a real risk their clients could be tortured, punished, or face inhumane and degrading treatment in violation of the European Convention on Human Rights and they cite Rwanda\u2019s history of abusing refugees for dissent. The second flank of their argument is that the home secretary did not thoroughly investigate how Rwanda determines the status of refugees. One of the claimants asserts that the U.K. must still abide by European Union asylum procedures despite its Brexit split from the EU that became final in 2020. EU policies only allow asylum-seekers to be sent to a safe third country if they have a connection to it. Even if the courts allow the policy to proceed, it\u2019s unclear how many people will be flown to Rwanda at a cost estimated to be $206,000 per person. And there\u2019s a chance it wouldn\u2019t be in place for long. The leader of the opposition Labour Party, Keir Starmer, said Sunday that he would scrap the policy if elected prime minister. Polls show Labour has an advantage in an election that must be called by the end of next year. \u201cI think it\u2019s the wrong policy, it\u2019s hugely expensive,\u201d Starmer told the BBC. The court is not expected to rule immediately after the hearing. Copyright \u00a9 2023 The Washington Times, LLC. Please read our comment policy before commenting.

    "content": "Back Print By Associated Press - Sunday, October 8, 2023 LONDON \u2014 Bills edge-rusher Von Miller is active for Buffalo\u2019s game Sunday against the Jacksonville Jaguars but defensive end Shaq Lawson is out with a toe injury. The Bills activated Miller, the NFL\u2019s all-time active sacks leader, from the reserve-physically unable-to-perform list on Saturday. He hasn\u2019t played since injuring his knee last November. Starting defensive end Greg Rousseau (foot) is also out. Christian Benford (shoulder) is inactive, meaning Buffalo will be without its two starting cornerbacks. Tre\u2019Davious White tore his right Achilles tendon last week. Damar Hamlin is inactive a week after the safety played in his first regular-season game some nine months since having a near-death experience on the field at Cincinnati. For the Jaguars, LT Cam Robinson (suspension), WR Zay Jones (knee), and return specialist Jamal Agnew (quad) are all active as expected. Jacksonville\u2019s inactives are WR Elijah Cooks, CB Christian Braswell, LB Devin Lloyd and OL Cole Van Lanen. Jags\u2019 WR Parker Washington (knee) was placed on the reserve/injured list Saturday. Veteran edge rusher Dawuane Smoot, who returned to practice this week, remains on the physically unable to perform list. He sustained a torn Achilles tendon last December.

    "content": "Former Vice President Mike Pence (R), a 2024 presidential candidate, on Sunday criticized President Biden for his strategic positioning on Iran and suggested the administration\u2019s policies have \u201cset the conditions\u201d for the Hamas attacks in Israel on Saturday. In an interview on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union,\u201d Pence pointed to the recent U.S.-Iran hostage exchange, which will unfreeze $6 billion of Iranian funds in foreign accounts which had been blocked because of sanctions. The Biden administration has said that Iran has pledged to only use the funds for humanitarian purposes, but Iranian leaders have said they would decide what was best for their people. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Sunday said those funds remain unspent in a frozen account in the weeks after the prisoner exchange was conducted. \u201cPresident Joe Biden\u2019s kowtowing for the last two and a half years to the mullahs in Iran, lifting sanctions, begging them to get back in the Iran nuclear deal, and then paying $6 billion in a ransom for hostages, I think, set the conditions for this unprecedented terrorist attack by Hamas against Israel,\u201d Pence said. But the Biden administration has maintained unwavering support for Israel in the wake of an attack by Hamas on Saturday that took Israel by surprise. The prisoner exchange freed Americans who had been jailed in Iran under harsh conditions for years. Still, Pence laid heavy criticism on the White House. \u201cThere\u2019s no question in my mind that Iran is behind, has subsidized, has approved and in the last day has even applauded this extraordinary terrorist attack by Hamas against Israel,\u201d he said. U.S. officials said Sunday they could not yet determine if Iran was behind the attack. Pence also criticized the foreign policy positions of some of his fellow GOP presidential candidates, including former President Trump, biotech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. \u201cBut I also believe this is what happens when we have leading voices like Donald Trump, Vivek Ramaswamy and Ron DeSantis signaling retreat from America\u2019s role as leader of the free world. Look, what happened in Ukraine was an unprovoked invasion by Russia. What happened this weekend was an unprovoked invasion by Hamas into Israel,\u201d Pence continued in the interview. \u201cAnd I really believe now more than ever, both the debate within the Republican Party and the debate within America is whether or not we\u2019re going to once again stand without apology as the leader of the free world, as the arsenal of democracy,\u201d he continued.",

    "description": "Amazon's second round of Prime Day deals is here, but don't buy into every laptop deal you see. Here's what you need to know.",
    "content": "The second round of deals is almost upon us, this time with a new name: Prime Big Deal Days. This will be one of the best times of the year to upgrade your tech, whether that's laptops, phones, accessories, or other electronics. We've already started rounding up the best for you, but you might run into others and wonder whether you should take advantage of them or not. It's important not to get too swept up in the excitement of Prime Day deals, as you'll run into a lot of listings for old or underpowered PCs trying to pass off as a deal. So, we're here to help you by highlighting some important things to look out for when browsing for deals over the next couple of days. Watch out for old specs One of the most common things you'll come across during Prime Big Deal Days is laptops that claim to have big discounts when, in reality, they're just an attempt to get rid of old stock. A lot of companies prey on unsuspecting customers when it comes to PC specs, so it's important to have an idea of what's relatively recent. A lot of listings will have words like \"newest\" or \"latest\" to describe old models. If you're buying a new laptop today, we recommend looking for at least Intel 11th-generation or AMD Ryzen 5000 series processors. The have up to 13th-generation (for Intel) or Ryzen 7000 series (for AMD), so try to look for those numbers when shopping around. For example, the model below has an 11th-generation processor, as noted in the listing, but also in the processor name, Core i5- 35G7. In a similar vein, if you're buying a gaming laptop, you have to look out for old graphics cards. For Nvidia GPUs, you should mostly be looking for the RTX 30 or RTX 40 series. Anything below that is too old and underpowered for a new laptop. On the AMD side, we'd recommend looking for the Radeon 6000 series, so avoid models with numbers starting in 5 or lower. A lot of listings will have words like \"newest\" or \"latest\" to describe old models. A couple of extra things worth looking out for include having at least 8GB of RAM, at least for Windows machines. Chromebooks may not need as much power, but if you're buying a Windows PC, 8GB of RAM is the bare minimum for a solid experience, and even on , 8GB is preferable. Most of Apple's MacBooks are fairly high-end machines, so you shouldn't have to worry as much about underpowered configurations. However, you should definitely avoid any Macs with Intel processors and look for models with the Apple M1 or M2 processors. The M2 models are preferred, but if there's a very big discount, an M1 model may still be good. Buy from reputable brands Something else you might see are products from brands you've probably never heard of and that, many times, sound like they've been created using a random name generator. You'll see this a lot, especially on Amazon, and they're important to avoid. These companies have close to no track record, not only in terms of the quality itself but also in customer support in case something goes wrong. Even if a laptop looks like a good deal, it might break down and leave you without a way to fix it or get reimbursed for your purchase. What's more, a lot of these companies also have a tendency to overvalue their products' \"real price,\" so many of these deals aren't even discounts in the first place. Make sure you check that the product is fulfilled by Amazon, either in the box on the right-hand side or with the blue Prime icon. Additionally, even if you're buying a computer from a well-known brand, places like Amazon and Newegg have another trap that's easy to fall for: third-party sellers. Of course, many third-party sellers are legitimate businesses with great customer support, but the openness of Amazon and Newegg makes it very easy for unknown, shady companies to have their listings shown to a wide audience. You may be expecting to get one product but receive something completely different, you may be unable to return the product, or you may get no customer support at all if things go wrong. Make sure you check that the product is fulfilled by Amazon, either in the box on the right-hand side or with the blue Prime icon. Even though there are a lot of buyer protections in place, no one wants the hassle of having to ship something back or go through a tedious repair process, especially when there's no guarantee things will actually be solved. Before buying, check who's selling a product and what their seller rating is to have an idea of what to expect. Double-check prices Another shady tactic many sellers use is to arbitrarily mark up the \"official\" price of a product in the lead-up to a sales event like Amazon Prime Big Deal Days. This allows them to claim a much bigger discount than what you're actually getting, and sometimes, it may not be a discount at all. When you find a deal that seems good, try to compare prices with other retailers first. On top of that, it's a good idea to install an extension like Keepa or Honey, or use a website like CamelCamelCamel. These are price trackers, and they let you see the price history of an item so you can make sure that the current price is actually worth your attention. It's also worth getting back to my first point about specs. While it can be worth it to buy a laptop with an 11th-generation processor, you have to be especially careful with deals on these models. Older computers naturally aren't as good or future-proof, so they're only worth it if they have truly major discounts compared to newer models. Buy only what you need Finally, one tip you can use for any time you go shopping is to buy only what you need. Something being a great deal doesn't always mean it's a great fit for you, and it doesn't mean you need to spend money. I always say that if you buy a $3,000 product for $2,000, but you didn't need that product in the first place, then you didn't save $1,000 \u2014 you just spent $2,000. If you already have a modern laptop with 12th-generation Intel processors, for example, there's probably no reason to upgrade to a 13th-generation model unless something is really not working for you. Similarly, if you already have a GeForce RTX 30 series GPU, you don't need an RTX 40 series model just yet. It's okay to wait a little longer for a more meaningful upgrade when you actually need it. And on the topic of gaming, don't buy laptops that aren't suited for the tasks you plan to use them for. A work and school laptop probably doesn't need an Nvidia GPU unless you're also using it for gaming. You're not going to benefit from spending more on a gaming laptop unless you're using that power for tasks that actually need it. Conversely, buying a super cheap laptop without a dedicated GPU won't be a good way to save money if it can't handle the games you want to play or if you want to edit videos, for example. Regardless of Amazon Prime Day (or Prime Big Deal Days) or any other sales event, these pieces of advice are always important to keep in mind when shopping for a laptop. You should always try to avoid old specs, buy from reliable brands and sellers, and make sure you're getting a good deal on a product you actually benefit from. And if you're looking beyond laptops, we also have roundups of great deals on , , and other .",

    "description": "The Trojans needed heroics from Caleb Williams and triple overtime to fend off Arizona, a three-touchdown underdog.",
    "content": "With only four games and no matchups involving ranked teams, the seventh Saturday of the Pac-12 season did not have the look of the most dramatic thus far, but it delivered a series of riveting affairs. Only one of the four games was decided by double digits (Oregon State over Cal), and each of the other three was in doubt with two minutes remaining. We figured it would be difficult to top Colorado\u2019s late escape in Tempe \u2014 the Buffaloes kicked the game-winning field goal with 12 seconds left \u2014 but then USC-Arizona happened. And it was glorious mayhem. Who figured UCLA would hold WSU\u2019s high-scoring offense to 10 points. Or that USC would manage just 28 points in regulation (about half its season average) against Arizona. Or that ASU quarterback Trenton Bourguet would throw for 100 yards more than Colorado\u2019s Shedeur Sanders. Or that Arizona freshman quarterback Noah Fifita would play as well as USC\u2019s Caleb Williams. Or that Cal would score 40 points, rush for more than 200 yards and lose by double digits. Week 6 was loaded with the unexpected. To this point, USC\u2019s triple-overtime escape stands as the game of the year in the conference. The Trojans trailed 17-0 before finding their rhythm offensively and led 28-20 midway through the fourth quarter. But they couldn\u2019t hold the advantage, then bungled a game-winning, 25-yard field goal in the final seconds of regulation. It took Caleb Williams\u2019 amazing feats, and feet, to escape in the extra periods. A sloppy affair filled with sputtering offense ended in pulsating fashion when the Sun Devils went 94 yards in 13 plays for the game-tying touchdown with 50 seconds remaining. That was more than enough time for CU to respond as Shedeur Sanders completed a 43-yard pass that set up a 43-yard, game-winning field goal. The Buffaloes (4-2) are now two wins away from being bowl-eligible and host Stanford on Friday. Fisch had the Wildcats ready to play emotionally, and perfectly prepared tactically, in their final scheduled game against USC. The balanced playcalling (42 runs, 35 passes) put freshman quarterback Noah Fifita in positions to succeed and kept USC\u2019s defense guessing. The defensive gameplan was top-notch, as well. Arizona\u2019s three losses this season (to Mississippi State, Washington and USC) have come by a total of 16 points. The first-year defensive strategist made maximum use of his extra week to prepare for WSU\u2019s high-octane attack. Lynn unveiled a defensive front in which at least two, and sometimes all three players were in standing positions. The unblockable Bruins forced four turnovers, held WSU\u2019s offense to one touchdown and limited quarterback Cam Ward to 197 yards passing. The Cougars never did figure it out. The third-year coach addressed what is typically a verboten topic among coaches, the point spread, following the overtime defeat at USC. \u201cI think the 21-point underdog stuff has got to probably come to an end here soon,\u201d Fisch said. Savvy gamblers hope he\u2019s wrong, because there is money to be made on the Wildcats until the betting lines adjust to the on-field reality. After his team allowed Oregon State to score 52 points and gain 499 yards, Wilcox offered the following: \u201cWe\u2019ll find out where the defenders are come next week, because boy \u2014 and this is not taking anything away from Oregon State because I really do think those guys do a great job coaching \u2014 but, man, ooh, that was bad defense right there by us.\u201d The transfer quarterback had his best game as a Beaver (especially considering the competition), throwing for five touchdowns and completing 76 percent of his passes against what is typically a well-coached defense. And critically, Uiagalelei did not throw an interception, which separated him from other players we considered for the OPOW honors. The senior receiver hauled in 10 catches for 88 yards and against USC, including two scores in overtime. He\u2019s now tied for third nationally in touchdown catches with eight and tied for fifth in receptions with 46. UCLA tailback Carson Steele, Oregon State receiver Anthony Gould and ASU receiver Elijhah Badger. It\u2019s not often that the Hotline honors an entire unit, but the Bruins\u2019 defensive front was magnificent from the first snap to the last, often generating pressure with just three rushers. Gabriel Murphy and Laiatu Latu generated much of the chaos but were hardly alone. (Carl Jones Jr. had four tackles and a QB hurry.). A few hours later and several miles across town, Arizona\u2019s line submitted a first-rate effort of its own. Related Articles The Cougars converted 60 percent of their third-down opportunities through the first four games of the season, tops in the nation. But they managed just two conversions in 13 attempts Saturday in the Rose Bowl. The Trojans finished the first half with a 6-0 mark against teams that have a combined record of 10-24. The record of their next six foes: 26-7. As the existential crisis looms in the background, the Beavers (5-1) have produced their best start since 2013, when they opened 6-1 before slamming into a five-game losing streak. Their next four games: UCLA at home, Arizona and Colorado on the road, then Stanford at home. The Bears started their third different quarterback, freshman Fernando Mendoza, in an attempt to jump-start a struggling offense. Mendoza had one career pass attempt prior to Saturday but played reasonably well with 200 yards passing and two touchdowns. Justin Wilcox\u2019s program has now played 1.5 seasons since Chase Garber\u2019s departure and has yet to achieve stability at the most important position. ESPN\u2019s \u2018College GameDay\u2019 will be on hand as the bitter rivals collide. It\u2019s the third time the popular studio show has made the trek to Montlake and the first time in series history that both teams will carry top-10 rankings into the game. The Huskies are an early 3-point favorite. Our preference for guest picker: UW alum Rainn Wilson. Maybe he can serve Kirk Herbstreit and the \u2018GameDay\u2019 crew some beets from Schrute Farms.",

    "description": "At least 370 Palestinians and over 600 Israelis have now been killed in the escalating violence.",
    "content": "Hundreds of Palestinians have been killed over the past 24 hours as Israel bombarded the Gaza Strip with airstrikes \u2014 Israel\u2019s response to \u201cOperation Al-Aqsa Flood\u201d, launched by Hamas on Saturday morning. It is reported that over 600 Israelis have been killed in the past 24 hours, which is more than in the first year-and-a-half of the second Intifada. Hours after Hamas launched the operation, the largest Palestinian offensive on Israel in decades, Israel announced it was launching \u201cOperation Iron Swords\u201d, with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu saying, \u201cCitizens of Israel, we are at war. The enemy will pay an unprecedented price.\u201d Airstrikes began just minutes after the Israeli operation was announced, shortly before 11 a.m. local time on Saturday. Airstrikes continued throughout Saturday afternoon and into the night, with Israeli airstrikes leveling entire residential buildings in the densely-populated Gaza Strip. Rocket fire from the Strip also continued into the night, with Hamas reporting more than 5,000 rockets fired into Israel. On Sunday afternoon, around 3:30 pm local time, the Israeli Security Cabinet officially declared a state of war, which, according to a statement from the Prime Minister\u2019s Office allows the government to carry out \u201csignificant military activities.\u201d Prime Minister Netanyahu released a statement on Sunday telling Palestinians in Gaza to \u201cleave now,\u201d because Israel is going to \u201cturn all Hamas hiding places into rubble.\u201d More than two million Palestinians live in the Gaza Strip, which is under complete blockade by both Israel and Egypt. Gaza\u2019s land borders, as well as airspace and maritime borders, are all under the control of the Israeli military, meaning that it is virtually impossible for Gazans to leave the territory unless Israel or Egypt open up their borders, which at the time of publication remained closed. Saturday overnight was rough for Palestinians in Gaza, the Israeli bombardment never stops. Massive airstrikes and shelling target resident towers, homes, lands, police headquarters checkpoints, and civil institutions. Five resident towers, which are homes for thousands of people, have been completely destroyed since Saturday afternoon, and hundreds of homes were bombed with people still inside. Several families across the Gaza Strip were wiped out by Israeli bombing in Dier Al-Balah, Khan Yonus, and Rafah. In addition, Israel announced it would cut off power supplies to the Gaza Strip, so that now people will only receive 2-4 hours of power daily. The bombings have also damaged other infrastructure, and some areas in Gaza have lost internet connection in addition to power. The Gaza health ministry reported 313 were killed by the Israeli fire and over 1,990 injuries. Dozens of people are still missing without any details about them. By Saturday afternoon, people in Gaza knew the incoming Israeli response would be overwhelming. In al-Shuja\u2019iyya, an area home to over 300,000 people in eastern Gaza, people began packing their belongings and leaving their homes to the center of Gaza City. Some people went to their relatives\u2019 homes, but most headed to the UNRWA schools in Gaza. UNRWA said that 28 schools in Gaza are prepared to host people who evacuated their homes across the Strip and reported that 20,300 people had already evacuated to the schools since Saturday. People in al-Shuja\u2019iyya have learned the lesson since the 2014 war when Israel bombed the area and forced people to leave their homes barefoot amid massive bombing as they were forced to flee. The Israeli government is once again threatening Palestinians to leave their homes. The Israeli government coordinator who runs a Facebook page for Gaza workers who work in Israel posted a warning that included seven areas in Gaza that should evacuate their homes, including al-Shuja\u2019iyya. Due to this, many in al-Shuja\u2019iyya are leaving their homes before the situation worsens, although the possibilities of finding a safe space remain unclear. As of 2 p.m. local time, Palestinian resistance fighters were still engaged with Israeli forces in several Israeli localities bordering Gaza, while the Israeli army announced that it would be evacuating 25 other border towns, and possibly more in the next 24 hours \u201caccording to the assessment of the situation.\u201d Throughout the day, the fighting between Israeli forces and Palestinian commandos has been thickest in Kfar Aza, Re\u2019im, Ofakim, Kissufim, Kibbutz Magen, Erez, Zikim, and several other Israeli colonies, although the map of confrontation continues to shift throughout the day, with some place being taken over by Israeli forces, while others coming under control of Palestinian resistance fighters. Most importantly, both the resistance factions\u2019 media organs and Israeli military sources are confirming that the Palestinian forces have been able to partially resupply in certain areas, which indicates that the resistance intends to prolong its operation in occupied Palestine. Hamas military spokesperson Abu Obidah confirmed that Hamas could resupply its fighters inside the occupied territories and managed to infiltrate more fighters. \u201cThe Al-Qassam leadership managed to supply the fighters with weapons, shells, and equipment. The leadership also infiltrated new fighters and supported them with over 100 rockets.\u201d Abu Obidah said. In a recent statement by Abu Obidah, he said that the Hamas air forces joined the battle with over 35 homemade drones. The fighters inside Israel are not only Hamas-affiliated fighters, the PIJ also said that dozens of its fighters are joining the battle and fighting the Israelis. Whether this may lead to extended control over areas surrounding Gaza, or is part of a moving force meant to fulfill limited tactical objectives before withdrawing, remains to be seen. Media reports have reported increasing Israeli and Palestinian casualties from the ongoing fighting in the settlements, and the Israeli army released the names of 25 soldiers killed during the fighting as of 1 p.m. local time. On Sunday morning, October 8, Hezbollah forces in southern Lebanon fired rockets into northern occupied Palestine at three Israeli targets in the Shebaa Farms region, which is historically Lebanese land that has been occupied by Israel since 1967. The areas targeted by Hezbollah were \u201cradar sites\u201d such as Zebdine and Ruwaisat al-Alam. The Islamic resistance organization put out a statement following the attack, proclaiming that it was \u201con the road to the liberation of what remains of occupied Lebanese soil,\u201d and that an armed force in Hezbollah had carried out these attacks on the Israeli sites with \u201ca large amount of artillery fire and guided missiles.\u201d The immediate cause of the strike was its coinciding with the surprise attack of the Gaza resistance a day earlier, which Hezbollah conducted in retaliation for Israel\u2019s retribution against Palestinians in Gaza and its attacks on Al-Aqsa, and \u201cin solidarity with the Palestinian resistance and their struggle,\u201d as conveyed by a Hezbollah spokesperson. Yet the Lebanese strike was also preceded by gradually mounting tensions on occupied Palestine\u2019s northern border, namely between Hezbollah and the Israeli regime. The tensions expressed themselves in various incidents and inflammatory remarks from Israeli officials, including Defense Minister Yoav Gallant\u2019s threats of sending Lebanon \u201cback to the Stone Age\u201d after Hezbollah put up tents on the Israeli side of the border. By approximately 11:50 a.m. local time,, the head of Hezbollah\u2019s Executive Council, Hashem Safi al-Din, put out a statement saying that \u201cwe are not remaining neutral in the battle that is being waged against the Israeli occupation.\u201d Seven Palestinians have been killed by Israeli gunfire in the West Bank since Saturday morning, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, including one child. Following the beginning of \u201cOperation Al-Aqsa Flood\u201d out of Gaza on Saturday morning, protests and demonstrations in support of Gaza erupted in various parts of the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem. At the same time, Israeli settlers embarked on a number of attacks on Palestinian villages across the West Bank. The first Palestinian to be killed in the West Bank on Saturday was an unidentified man from the Ramallah-area village of al-Lubban al-Gharbiyye, west of Ramallah, according to the Palestinian Authority-owned Wafa news agency. The man was shot and killed after allegedly attempting to carry out a stabbing near the illegal Ariel settlement in the Salfit district of the West Bank. Later in the afternoon, the Israeli army shot and killed a young Palestinian man during confrontations near the entrance to Jericho city. He was identified as Karam Nasser al-Aydi, 22, a resident of the Ain al-Sultan refugee camp in Jericho. Al-Aydi was reportedly shot in the head by Israeli gunfire. In the town of al-Bireh, which borders Ramallah in the central West Bank, one Palestinian young man was killed and at least 12 others were injured by the Israeli army during protests at the northern entrance to the city. Omar Ibrahim Al-Tarsha, a resident of the Ramallah-area town of Beitunia, was shot in the head and later succumbed to his wounds. According to the Palestinian Red Crescent Society, medical crews treated 12 Palestinians for gunshot wounds and rubber-coated steel bullet injuries during the confrontations. A 12-year-old Palestinian boy was shot and killed in the city of Qalqilya in the northwestern West Bank, according to Defense for Children International Palestine (DCIP). He was identified as Ahmad Abdulnaser Adnan Rabi, and was participating in a demonstration that marched towards an Israeli checkpoint outside the city when Israeli forces began opening fire on demonstrators. According to DCIP, an Israeli soldier shot Ahmad in the waist from a distance of 50-100 meters (165-330 feet). The boy was transported bia ambulance to a nearby hospital where he underwent surgery for about an hour before he was pronounced dead. According to DCIP, Ahmad was one of at least 40 Palestinian children who were killed by Israel in the West Bank in 2023. Later on Saturday night, a 19-year-old Palestinian was shot and killed in the city of Hebron. According to Wafa news, 19-year-old Yusuf Nader Suleiman Idris was shot by Israeli forces in the chest. The circumstances of his killing, and whether there were protests or confrontations happening at the moment. Another Palestinian teenager, identified by the MOH as Mahmoud Basem Khmais, 18, was killed by Israeli forces during confrontations at the entrance of the town of Beit Ummar in the Hebron district of the southern West Bank. Khmais was shot in the chest and was immediately rushed to the hospital, where he was pronounced dead. Several other Palestinians were injured during the confrontations in Beit Ummar, primarily with rubber-coated steel bullets and tear gas. A seventh Palestinian was killed in the early morning hours of Sunday, October 8th, in the Nablus district of the northern West Bank. He was identified as 19-year-old Ahmed Atef Awawdeh. Awawdeh was reportedly shot dead by Israeli forces near the Palestinian town of Deir Sharaf. The Jenin Brigade released a statement claiming Awawdeh as one of its fighters, saying he was martyred while \u201cengaging in an armed clash with the occupation forces near Shavei Shomron [settlement].\u201d A general strike was announced across the West Bank on Saturday night. By Sunday morning, shops, businesses, government offices and schools were all shuttered as approximately three million Palestinians observed the strike. In addition to suppressing protests across the West Bank, the Israeli army enforced massive closures inside the West bank and along the borders of the occupied territory, shutting down major checkpoints into occupied Jerusalem and Israeli-controlled territory. Israeli forces set up roadblocks and closed off entrances and exits to at least six villages in the Ramallah governorate. Israeli forces also enforced a full closure of the Bethlehem governorate, closing off the main checkpoints surrounding Bethlehem city and the neighboring town of Beit Jala, as well as a number of villages in the Bethlehem governorate. In the wake of the Gaza operation on Saturday morning, Israeli settlers carried out a number of attacks across the West Bank. In Jenin, Israeli settlers opened fire on Palestinian homes in the town of Jalbun in two separate incidents on Saturday. No injuries were reported. A group of Israeli settlers also launched an attack on the Salfit-area village of Yasuf, firing live ammunition at Palestinians and setting fire to homes. According to local media, two Palestinians were injured with live ammunition, and two homes in the village were set on fire. When residents went out to confront the settlers and defend their village, they were reportedly met with violence from both settlers and accompanying Israeli soldiers, who fired live ammunition, rubber bullets, and tear gas at Palestinians. A similar attack was reported in the Nablus-area village of Qusra, though no injuries were reported. Israeli settlers also attacked and injured Palestinian farmers in the Bethlehem and Jordan Valley districts of the West Bank.",

    "content": "Boss Women Media founder Marty McDonald has always strategically used her platform to showcase the brilliance of Black women. Her annual business summit, , reconvened in person for the first time in three years just last week. The event, which took place in Dallas, centered Black women entrepreneurs and included speakers KeKe Palmer, Pinky Cole and Nicole Lynn. The conference was a notable success and $100k was awarded to three Black women business founders at its conclusion. In addition, McDonald announced the launch of her new podcast at Black Magic Reimagined entitled \u201cThe Audacity of Ambitious Women,\u201d which is available on Spotify now. Her children\u2019s apparel and book brand \u201cElle Olivia\u201d officially launches today in 400 Target stores nationwide, proving that the CEO is in her winning season. \u201cElle Olivia,\u201d McDonald tells , is about Black girls having true representation and encourages them to dream big. When we showcased the brand [at pop-up shops], everyone was so proud of seeing a character that their daughter could wear that looks like them. Some feedback that we\u2019ve just received was \u2018the product speaks to exactly my little girl.\u2019 \u201cThe opportunities of where we show up and how we exist are still sparse, right?,\u201d she asks. \u201cSo it\u2019s important for us to continue to show up to create space.\u201d McDonald believes that genuineness is the greatest currency Black women possess. \u201cWe need Black women to continue to show up and be their authentic selves and to create space for them and others so that we will continue to be in spaces and places where we belong and deserve to be.\u201d It took a lot for McDonald to pave this unique and vital lane for herself. She left her marketing job back in 2018 to fully dedicate herself to Boss Women Media. It wasn\u2019t so much a leap of faith as it was a conscious decision to bet on herself. McDonald says the choice, however, was a difficult one to make and only could happen once she was outside of her comfort zone. \u201cIt mentally took for someone to constantly not believe in me. It took for me to be challenged in a way that allowed me to feel imposter syndrome, to feel isolated, to feel like I didn\u2019t belong. Because if I didn\u2019t experience those feelings from the get go, then I wouldn\u2019t know what the reward of feeling the complete opposite would be. \u201cOnce I was able to hone in on what good enough looked like for me and what me belonging looked like through self-confidence and mindset shifting, then I was able to say \u2018I am betting on myself and I believe in myself.\u2019 I\u2019m not allowing paralyzing fear to prevent me from being happy and having a career that I love and do work that\u2019s making an impact\u2014work that is changing the lives of others along with changing my own life.\u201d As a business owner, McDonald knows the pressure she faces is higher than her non-Black peers to achieve success. She reveals that being overly critical of herself comes with territory but has improved over the years. \u201cYou better believe I\u2019ve struggled with perfectionism. When it comes to working with brands, I have to set clear expectations of what I say that I\u2019m gonna deliver to them. \u201cBecause I am a Black-owned business, the opportunities are either smaller to exist or the opportunities for impact seem like I have to make such huge jumps for companies to recognize what success looks like. So I don\u2019t put myself in a box of everything has to be perfect based off of X, Y, and Z because it is not always gonna be right. But setting those clear expectations up front is how I\u2019m able to deliver against that.\u201d Ultimately, McDonald understands her purpose is much bigger than her. \u201cBoss Women Media is just a testament of the work and a testament to what we\u2019re producing for women and how they need it,\u201d she explains. \u201cPeople are tired of just being empowered and not equipped. \u201cWe are equipping women with other women who look and sound like them to be fierce and fearless to go after their careers or their business dreams.\u201d McDonald also understands that Black women entrepreneurs are under attack, as by Edward Blum\u2019s ruthless quest to stop the Fearless Fund. She says unity, not division, is more crucial than ever. \u201cThis is where we have to\u2014as Black organizations\u2014really take a stance together and not a space will we stand apart. We\u2019re all targets from the laws that were put in place in 2020, in 2021 and no one is safe in doing this work alone. This is a moment in time when we cannot be afraid to use our voices to stand together.\u201d In such a volatile climate, McDonald remains dedicated to her journey and relies on community to uplift her during trying times. \u201cFor me personally, I know that I\u2019m filled when I\u2019m doing the work that I\u2019ve laid in front of myself...it brings me a lot of joy. Being around people who fill me up, who are like-minded, who push me are all part of my self-care. \u201cIt\u2019s not just going to get my nails done or getting a pedicure or getting my hair done. It\u2019s about what fills me inside, gives me purpose, drives me forward. And by me leaning into just that for self-care moments, I\u2019m protecting myself, my mind, my body and my spirit.\u201d",

That result ultimately cost Liverpool the title, I guess. Mahrez penalty miss leaves Liverpool and Manchester City at impasse Read more Updated at 17.52 BST 3m ago 17.50 BST 61 min \u201cIs Haaland playing?\u201d writes Jeff Sax. \u201cHe has had no effect on the game so far.\u201d He just fell over, which the home fans very much enjoyed. The quieter he is, the more worried I\u2019d probably be as an Arsenal supporter. Updated at 17.50 BST 5m ago 17.49 BST 59 min The left-back Gvardiol has arguably been City\u2019s most purposeful attacker so far, which is another thing I didn\u2019t expect to type today. Updated at 17.49 BST 5m ago 17.48 BST 58 min City suddenly spring into action. Alvarez releases the overlapping Gvardiol, who fizzes a square ball to Foden just inside the area. He can\u2019t sort his feet out for a shot so instead lays it back to Alvarez, whose first-time shot is well blocked by Gabriel. He and Saliba have been excellent. 7m ago 17.46 BST 57 min City make a total Horlicks of the free-kick. 8m ago 17.45 BST 56 min Lewis puts the ball in the Arsenal net, though Michael Oliver had long since penalised Martinelli for fouling him 30 yards from goal. He handled it anyway so there\u2019s no controversy here, it gives me great pleasure ro report. Updated at 17.46 BST 9m ago 17.44 BST 55 min Odegaard chips a seductive ball into Nketiah, back to goal in the area. Dias holds him up expertly and that\u2019s the end of that. 10m ago 17.43 BST 54 min It\u2019s all Arsenal at the start of the second half. City look like a team waiting to concede, which feels very weird to type. 11m ago 17.42 BST 52 min \u201cRussell Yong gives no consideration to how many chances were created as a result of the keeper booting it long and giving it away to the opposition around midfield,\u201d says Adam Becker. \u201cGranted, it is a much less dangerous chance, but the maths of the volume of chances there, plus the possession given away by booting it long, could very well mean playing it short is statistically better. I don\u2019t know for sure, but there are more variables than just the comical errors in front of goal (which I think Russell is overstating the frequency of anyway).\u201d These are very fair points. It\u2019s a complicated subject if you only consider the percentages, never mind when you add managerial philosophy and everything else. 13m ago 17.40 BST 51 min Declan Rice is having a terrific game. He robs Lewis and slides an angled pass to Martinelli, who whacks a shot straight at Ederson from a tight angle. Much better from Arsenal . 14m ago 17.39 BST 50 min Nketiah wins a corner for Arsenal . Martinelli\u2019s wicked inswinger is flapped away under pressure by Ederson.

Gabriel of Arsenal has a shot saved by Ederson of Manchester City. Photograph: Ryan Pierse/Getty Images Updated at 17.47 BST 15m ago 17.38 BST 49 min Arsenal have started the second half better than City, who have looked half asleep for most of this game, even when they\u2019ve been keeping the ball for long periods. They\u2019re not right at the moment, though I appreciate there are reasons for that. 17m ago 17.36 BST 47 min Martinelli has already got the crowd going. He throws a few shapes on the left, then curls a good inswinging cross that just evades Jesus at the far post. 17m ago 17.36 BST 47 min \u201cPenny for Alex Greenwood\u2019s thoughts given her and Mateo Kova\u010di\u0107\u2019s respective afternoons ,\u201d writes Tom Stratford. \u201cNot sure I entirely understand this sport anymore\u2026\u201d 18m ago 17.35 BST 46 min Peep peep! 19m ago 17.34 BST Half-time substitution for Arsenal To loud cheers, Gabriel Martinelli returns to the side in place of Leandro Trossard. 19m ago 17.34 BST \u201cI understand the frustration with Kovacic not being sent off , I\u2019m an Arsenal fan, but I still have sympathy with Michael Oliver,\u201d writes K\u00e1ri Tulinius. \u201cReferees used to be interpreters of the game, artists in their own right, but now thanks to VAR people expect them to mete out objective justice.\u201d I\u2019d argue that VAR has created such a monstrous culture of entitlement that people expect referees to mete out subjective justice \u2013 the justice they want as a fan. This is why it\u2019s too late to go back to the old system. 25m ago 17.28 BST \u201cI completely disagree with you on the Jones tackle last week,\u201d says Espen Bommen. \u201cHowever, that aside, would you agree that if VAR freezes a frame of the studs making contact with Odegaard and his ankle bent at a horrible angle, Kovacic would now be off? There are many reasons to be opposed to VAR. One of them is that [potential libel deleted as a precaution because I missed our legal training session this week due to the cricket World Cup]. \u201d 30m ago 17.23 BST To play or not to play \u201cG\u2019day Rob,\u201d says Russell Yong. \u201cHearing of the latest travails of Raya and Onana, the mind harkens to those blooper compilations that were so popular round the turn of the century (you know the ones: slide whistles, comedic commentary, usually by Danny Baker). Back then, howlers of the \u2018goalkeeper gets robbed/cheaply coughs up possession to pressing striker\u2019 category were so rare they were genuinely memorable and the same from compilation to compilation. These days it feels like we have enough such moments from across Europe to fill a whole DVD every week. \u201cWhen it comes to playing out from the back and keepers playing like outfielders, it\u2019s all very well if you\u2019re City and can count on scoring five even if you cough up one (though it must be said that Ederson, for all that his team represents the alpha and omega of this playing style, actually rarely gives away such chances), but if you\u2019re anyone else, having your goalkeeper risk giving away even just one such chance a week is not something you can afford. \u201cI get that tactics evolve, but it seems ludicrous that so many managers, managing blatantly inferior players, have decided this risk is worth it and this is the acceptable logical conclusion. It makes me wonder when we\u2019re going to have a moment of great reckoning, although thinking back to the 2018 World Cup final and Mandzukic \u2018doing\u2019 Lloris, if that didn\u2019t force a reckoning, l guess we\u2019ll never get one.\u201d It would be interesting to know whether the decision to play out like that is driven by data, managerial ego, both or neither. And talking of bloopers, this clip fills me with joy. 34m ago 17.19 BST Half time: Arsenal 0-0 Man City Peep peep! No goals at the Emirates and not much excitement. Josko Gvardiola had the only shot on target, which was headed off the line by the outstanding Declan Rice, though Nathan Ake missed a very good chance and David Raya almost gave a goal to Julian Alvarez. City came closer to scoring, yet it\u2019s Arsenal who will feel aggrieved as they walk down the tunnel. Mateo Kovacic might have been sent off for a bad tackle on Martin Odegaard and was very lucky to avoid a second yellow for a lunge at Rice. Closest we have come to a goal. Arsenal's Declan Rice clears the ball off his own line Photograph: Adrian Dennis/AFP/Getty Images Updated at 17.33 BST 37m ago 17.16 BST 45 min Three minutes of added time. 39m ago 17.14 BST 43 min \u201cSo last week we see Curtis Jones sent off for a very similar foul to the one committed by Kovacic, but this week it is perfectly fine,\u201d says Richard Hirst. \u201cGo fathom.\u201d Jones\u2019s tackle was higher and therefore potentially more dangerous. I thought a yellow card was just about right for Kovacic\u2019s first foul, but I\u2019m very surprised he got away with the second. VAR can\u2019t get involved for bookings either, which is something they may need to think about, certainly for (potential) second yellows.

An outstanding cross from Gvardiol is missed by Raya, flapping desperately, but both Gabriel and Haaland can\u2019t make contact at the far post. 43m ago 17.10 BST 38 min Zinchenko has two shots blocked in the space of three or four seconds. City break and Lewis tries to play in Haaland, who bounces off Saliba and falls over. Saliba will feel 12 feet tall right now; that was a vital bit of defending. 44m ago 17.09 BST 38 min Arsenal are the better team at the moment. The match is also becoming more emotional, which should suit them more than City. 46m ago 17.07 BST 35 min Kovacic is late on Rice, and pretty much everyone at the Emirates expects him to be sent off. The referee Michael Oliver immediately waves his hands to say it\u2019s not worthy of a second yellow card. Mikel Arteta dances around in the highest dudgeon, and this time his antics are understandable: Kovacic should have been sent off. For an experienced player on a yellow card, that was a bizarrely risky tackle. No card:Manchester City's Mateo Kovacic reacts. Photograph: David Klein/Reuters Updated at 17.10 BST 48m ago 17.05 BST 34 min Alvarez wallops miles over from 25 yards. 48m ago 17.05 BST 33 min \u201cArsenal seem to get up for playing United, Liverpool, Chelsea and Spurs, but go into a complete mental fug against City,\u201d says Ederson. \u201cUnless they start believing they can beat the champions they are never going to manage it. Arteta has received huge praise for coming second but it seems to me more Solskjaer than Klopp.\u201d Time will tell. Didn\u2019t they play well for an hour in the home game last year? I missed it because I was working overnight on the cricket, but that\u2019s the impression I got from the reports I skim-read at 4am when I was barely awake. I\u2019ve been surprised by how poor they\u2019ve been today.

    "content": "NASA will launch its latest mission, Psyche, this week. The spacecraft will visit a strange asteroid that is thought to be made almost entirely of metal , studying it to understand more about the formation of planets in our solar system. Contents What to expect from the launch How to watch the launch Psyche Launches to a Metal Asteroid (Official NASA Broadcast) The mission has had some troubles and delays but is now ready to go ahead with the launch this Thursday, and the event will be livestreamed by NASA so you can watch along at home. We\u2019ve got the details below: Recommended Videos What to expect from the launch This artist\u2019s concept illustration depicts the spacecraft of NASA\u2019s Psyche mission near the mission\u2019s target, the metal asteroid Psyche. NASA/JPL-Caltech/Arizona State Univ./Space Systems Loral/Peter Rubin The spacecraft will launch using a SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket from Launch Complex 39A at NASA\u2019s Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Once it has left Earth\u2019s atmosphere, it will travel around 2.2 billion miles to the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter where it will go into orbit around asteroid Psyche. The journey will take just under six years, with the spacecraft\u2019s arrival at the asteroid scheduled for 2029. Related OSIRIS-REx mission returns asteroid sample to Earth in NASA first How to watch final moments of NASA\u2019s first asteroid sample return mission Watch NASA\u2019s cinematic trailer for its asteroid mission\u2019s homecoming The aim is for the spacecraft to begin its main mission in August 2029, when it will use its instruments including a camera, spectrometer, and magnetometer to investigate the metal asteroid. Psyche is around 170 miles across and is of particular interest to scientists because it is thought to be the core of an object called a planetesimal, which is one of the early stages of a forming planet. Studying Psyche could help scientists understand the early stages of the solar system and how rocky planets like Earth or Mars formed. In addition to the Psyche spacecraft, there will also be a secondary passenger along for the launch: a technology demonstration called Deep Space Optical Communications (DSOC). This small box attached to the spacecraft will test out using lasers to transmit data from beyond the moon, allowing higher bandwidth communications for future NASA missions. The DSOC will travel along with Psyche and transmit for the first two years of its journey, testing out the new communication system. How to watch the launch The launch will be livestreamed on one of NASA\u2019s TV channels, so you can watch the whole launch event. Coverage begins at 9:15 a.m. ET (6:15 a.m. PT) on Thursday, October 12, with liftoff scheduled for 10:16 a.m. ET (7:16 a.m. PT). There is also a spacewalk going on that day, so the spacewalk will be shown on the NASA TV public channel while the Psyche launch will be shown on the NASA Television media channel. To make life easier, you can head over to NASA\u2019s YouTube page for the Psyche launch and watch directly from there, or use the video embedded near the top of this page.

    "description": "David Heyman praised Barbie's originality at Deadline's Contender's London event.",
    "content": "Barbie is currently the highest-grossing film of 2023 , and it already has a lot of Oscar buzz. The film was directed and co-written by Greta Gerwig and stars Margot Robbie in the titular role alongside Ryan Gosling 's Ken. There are many reasons why the film has become such a phenomenon , and producer David Heyman attributes it to the audience's \"hunger for originality.\" Heyman recently spoke at Deadline 's Contender's London event and praised Barbie 's originality while addressing the audience. \"One of the reasons the film has done so well is because it's original,\" Heyman explained. \"There's a real hunger for originality. Greta Gerwig is a singular artist, she pushes the boundaries of what's possible in the most collaborative way. The film is fun, thematically rich, and very moving. It was challenging, of course, but when we made it, there was a spirit of fun that permeated the production.\" Last month, Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav gave Gerwig a shoutout during the Goldman Sachs Communacopia + Technology conference ( via Yahoo! ). \"Greta Gerwig gets the most credit. She's an extraordinary genius,\" Zaslav said when asked what lessons Warner Bros. was taking from the film reaching number one at the box office, adding that Gerwig \"worked very effectively\" and \"right down to the wire\" with the marketing team. \"Every division of this company got behind Barbie ,\" Zaslav explained. \"Every asset that we have was turned pink.\" He added, \"When we get something we believe in, we can really drive it.\" Barbie Has Yet To Surpass Frozen II At Box Office: Barbie has beaten lots of box office records since it was released in theaters. Greta Gerwig's new film managed to earn $1 billion in only 17 days to become the highest-grossing film directed solely by a woman . However, when you factor in movies co-directed by women, Barbie still isn't number one. The film did beat Captain Marvel , which was co-directed by Anna Boden, to become the highest-grossing live-action movie directed or co-directed by a woman , but there is still one animated film standing in Gerwig's way: Frozen II . Frozen II was released in 2019 and managed to earn $1,450,026,933 at the worldwide box office. The Disney film was co-directed by Jennifer Lee, who also helmed the first Frozen with Chris Buck. At the time of this writing, Barbie has made $1,434,628,000 worldwide. While Barbie is close to surpassing the animated film, the fact that it's been out for months and is now available to buy on digital could keep it from taking the record.

For one, the graphics are now in HD, which makes the aerial islands and dungeons look more vibrant and detailed. You can play it with motion controls or with a modified button and stick layout. The non-motion controls take a bit to get used to, but overall they are pretty good. The tutorial section has also been cleaned up, letting you get to the meat of the game without a boring slog through dozens of menus and slow-paced introductory missions. Autosaving, skippable cutscenes, and reworked camera controls round out the most important updates. Aside from those drastic changes, the core experience is still intact. You\u2019ll play as Link as he treks across a variety of floating islands and the land beneath the clouds in search of Zelda. The usual assortment of puzzle solving, dungeon diving, and enemy slaying are here in spades, and Zelda fanatics will probably find much to love about its story--according to Zelda lore, Skyward Sword is the very first game in the esoteric timeline. Our Skyward Sword HD review awarded it a 7/10, thanks to clever puzzles, engaging boss fights, and well-designed dungeons.

    "description": "Garth Davis explains what drove him to adapt sci-fi thriller Foe and how two stories were made into one movie.",
    "content": "Forbes Business Hollywood & Entertainment Director Garth Davis On Foe And How Sci-Fi Questions Our Existence Ma\u00eblle Beauget-Uhl Contributor Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own. I write about culture, cinema and tv. Following Oct 8, 2023, 04:10pm EDT | Press play to listen to this article! Got it! Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Set in 2065, Foe , directed by Garth Davis ( Lion ) and starring Academy Awards nominees Saoirse Ronan and Paul Mescal, makes us question our humanity and what part of it we are willing to let go of in the most extreme situations. Adapted from Ian Reid\u2019s novel of the same name, Foe introduces us to Henrietta and Junior, a young couple whose marriage is threatened when a stranger named Terrance (played by Aaron Pierre) announces that Junior has been chosen to be part of a mission that would send him to space for 2 years. Paul Mescal and Saoirse Ronan as Junior and Henrietta in Foe Prime Video Aaron tells Hen and Junior that a duplicate of Junior will be created in order to keep Hen company. To make this AI version of Junior, Terrance has to move in the couple\u2019s house to analyze Junior\u2019s character, and make sure that the other Junior will be as truthful to the real Junior as possible. Then begins an intense psychological mind game: Who really is the stranger in the house? Why are Hen and Junior behaving so strangely ? It is safe to say that watching the first hour and a half of Foe , spectators will mostly have questions, and not so many answers, until an unexpected and mind-blowing twist reveals the unbearable truth. This piece does contain spoilers past this point \"That was a great challenge, because for first time viewers, we kind of a had to create the illusion that they are watching a story that they believe is happening\u201d told me Davis. \"But the real story, which drove all the performances, is kind of hidden, and we don\u2019t really understand the truth of what is happening until later in the movie. The trick was \u2018How to achieve a first time viewing and a second time viewing that was truthful to what was happening?'. So that\u2019s what really excited us.\" Aaron Pierre as Terrance in Foe Prime Video Foe reminds us that the sci-fi genre comes in many shape or form. Here, it is reinvented within a dystopian romance, in a near apocalyptic world, where the climate crisis has completely change the face of the earth as we know it. It is now a world where rain no longer falls, and where hope seem to have deserted every corner of the planet.

It\u2019s A Tactic From 1973. But even in the midst of the worst and of the unimaginable, some existential questions, the very same questions that make us human, still need to be answered. Here, the characters are not required to fight an alien invasion, or to take part in spaceship battles. Instead, they have to fight for who they really are and for their relationship, in a world where everyone has already given up. \"I\u2019ve always loved sci-fi for the reason that it connects with your spirituality, with something bigger than our everyday lives, and reminds us what it is to be a human being in a universe. I love how that reminds us of our insignificance, and when we understand how insignificant we are, we understand how miraculous we are as well, and I love how sci-fi does that\" continued Davis. The director also explained that in Foe , the relationship between Hen and Junior \"has a lovely metaphorical parallel to the state of the planet\". Director Garth Davis on set of Foe Prime Video Trading in what makes us humans, including our pain, for a predictable future, where being alone doesn\u2019t need to be so lonely anymore, and where even death could become an option, are both a scary and fascinating thing to behold in Foe . As a spectator, I wondered if such a future could exist, and if I would ever consider making the decision Henrietta has. I asked Garth Davis if he had ever felt like what he was filming might actually be a version of our future: \"Absolutely, and the things that you so articulated beautifully, are the things that drove me to make it: I feel like society, in general, is asleep at the wheel. I mean the warning signs are there, I think we\u2019ve lost a connection to who we are, and by that I mean, really who we are. And I think the film encourages us to kind of stop and to be reminded that this time on earth is precious (\u2026) We have a responsibly to that, and when we fall in line with that, we find true happiness. And you really feel the full spectrum of life.\" Watching Foe is like standing in front of a very disturbing looking glass, asking us to reconsider how we treat ourselves: If we have the arrogance, the vanity, to create another form of intelligence, that we expect to be identical to us, both morally and physically, why aren\u2019t we willing to treat them as our equals ? \u2018\u2019There was something really precious at stake here: real or unreal, we have a responsibility to anything that is living.\u2019\u2019 added Davis. Saoirse Ronan and Paul Mescal in Foe Prime Video In a shocking, devastating plot twist, where Junior\u2019s AI version is being killed off, we also witness a complete lack of humanity, where people no longer face their responsibilities. Junior\u2019s AI version isn\u2019t even given a decent burial -something humans have been doing since the beginning of time-, and the metaphor of him being vacuumed into a bag in a foetal position is as clever as it is excruciating. So what kind of future is there to save ? How low were we thinking of ourselves to begin with ? \"We are nature, the way we treat ourselves reflect the way the planet is treated as well. And we got to realize that we are part of something bigger than our simple little lives that we lives, and our ego.\" corroborated Davis. As for a second viewing experience, for Davis, it really will be at this moment that spectators will \u2018\u2019align with Hen\u2019\u2019 as well as \u2018\u2019get an incredible emotional access to her\u2019\u2019. The performances in Foe are incredibly raw and heart-wrenching, and the chemistry of the trio Ronan-Mescal-Pierre is palpable. When the truth is finally revealed, and Hen is being separated from the other Junior, Davis explained that Paul Mescal \u2018\u2019had to access a very painful place\u2019\u2019, and it was his role as a director to \u2018\u2019give him a lot of emotional support\u2019\u2019. Through its incredible messages and acting, Foe is a movie that can stay with you for a very long time, but it will indeed require a second watch, in order to really get access to the full spectrum of emotions and multiple dilemmas Hen was facing from the start. Foe is now out in theaters and will be streaming soon on Prime Video. Ma\u00eblle Beauget-Uhl Editorial Standards Print Reprints & Permissions",

Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin FC Barcelona prodigy Lamine Yamal has become the youngest goalscorer of all time in La Liga history. ... [+] AFP via Getty Images FC Barcelona prodigy Lamine Yamal made history on Sunday by becoming La Liga's youngest ever goalscorer. The Spain international netted a much-needed strike for his boyhood club, who had been shocked by falling 2-0 down at Granada. Bryan Zaragoza Martinez put the hosts ahead with a brace which was started in less than half a minute when Gavi was dispossessed in his own half. Approaching the half hour mark, the winger doubled his side's account and left Xavi Hernandez's men stunned. The former midfielder didn't give his charges a dressing down during a water break approaching 40 minutes, though, and instead encouraged youngsters such as Fermin Lopez and Lamine Yamal. A pat on the back clearly worked for the teenager, who Xavi helped make history by becoming Barca's youngest appearance maker in the 21st century and in La Liga in the spring when given a run out towards the end of a 4-0 win over Real Betis. Since then, Lamine Yamal has become a starter in the first team and was guaranteed the nod this evening given injuries to Raphinha and Robert Lewandowski meaning Ferran Torres had to fill in as a striker. Playing on the right wing, the number 27 made an impact on the fixture and in history when embarking on an excellent diagonal run in the box in stoppage time of the first half. Latching on to Joao Felix's pass, Lamine Yamal made sure he stayed onside, controlled the ball with the outside of his stronger left foot and then poked home a much-needed consolation goal. Barca therefore went down the tunnel at the interval just a goal down, with Lamine's name the talk of social media. With another record broken, he had eclipsed Fabrice Olinga who scored the only goal of the game for Malaga against Celta Vigo on August 18, 2012 aged 16 years and 98 days. As another international break is upon us, it was now or never for Lamine Yamal to top Olinga and he has achieved it at 16 years and 87 days of age. After facing Granada, Barca will not be in action again until October 22 when they host Athletic Club at the Montjuic Stadium, with Lamine Yamal already 16 years and 101 days of age by then.

    "content": "US party leaders in Washington have wasted no time in turning the Middle East conflict into a domestic political dispute, with senior Republicans accusing both the Biden administration and each other of having triggered the violence. The secretary of state, Antony Blinken, charged top Republicans with exploiting the crisis for their own political ends after several Republican presidential hopefuls accused the Biden administration of effectively causing the conflagration. \u201cIt\u2019s deeply unfortunate that some are playing politics when so many lives have been lost and Israel remains under attack,\u201d Blinken told CNN\u2019s State of the Union. The reported presence of US citizens among the dead and captured from the Hamas attack on Israel is likely to inflame the partisan mud-slinging between Republican leaders and the White House. Several presidential candidates accused Joe Biden of being partly responsible for the crisis, blaming him for appeasing Iran through the recent deal involving the return of five detained Americans in exchange for the release of $6bn in frozen Iranian funds for humanitarian use. Blinken insisted on Sunday that none of the $6bn had yet been liquidated. \u201cNot a single dollar has been spent from that account. The account is closely regulated by the US treasury department, so it can only be used for things like food, medicine, medical equipment \u2013 that\u2019s what this is about,\u201d he told CNN. Tim Scott, the Republican senator from South Carolina who is vying for his party\u2019s presidential nomination, went so far as to accuse Biden personally of being \u201ccomplicit\u201d in the Hamas attack. \u201cBiden\u2019s weakness invited the attack, Biden\u2019s negotiation funded the attack,\u201d he said on social media. Nikki Haley, Donald Trump\u2019s former UN ambassador and another 2024 White House hopeful, also turned on the US president, saying that Blinken\u2019s assurance that the $6bn had not yet been released was duplicitous. \u201cHamas knows, and Iran knows, they\u2019re moving money around as we speak, because they know $6bn is going to be released. That\u2019s the reality,\u201d she said. The sniping was not limited to cross-party wrangling. Top Republicans also attacked each other over the Israeli crisis. The former vice-president and presidential hopeful Mike Pence seized the opportunity to take a pot shot at his former running mate Trump as well as two other rivals in the Republican presidential contest. Pence told CNN\u2019s State of the Union that the Middle East violence was partly catalysed by their calls for America to withdraw from the world stage. He pointed his finger specifically at the former US president, the entrepreneur, and the Florida governor respectively who have raised doubts about US funding to support Ukraine. \u201cThis is what happens when we have leading voices like Donald Trump and Vivek Ramaswamy and Ron DeSantis signaling retreat from America\u2019s role as leader of the free world. What happened in Ukraine was an unprovoked invasion by Russia, what happened this weekend was an unprovoked invasion by Hamas into Israel,\u201d he said. Top Republicans also lambasted their party peers for the vacuum in leadership in the House of Representatives at such a critical moment. Last week Kevin McCarthy was ousted as speaker of the House by the hard-right flank of the party, and a replacement has yet to be found. Another presidential hopeful, the former governor of New Jersey Chris Christie, said that the outbreak of fighting in the Middle East had made a bad business on Capitol Hill worse. \u201cThe actions taken by some members of my party were wholly irresponsible without this going on, they\u2019re now putting an even brighter light on the irresponsibility of not having someone in place,\u201d he told ABC\u2019s This Week. Michael McCaul, the Republican chair of the House foreign affairs committee, also lamented the absence of leadership. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t my idea to oust the speaker,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cI thought it was dangerous. What kind of message are we sending to our adversaries when we can\u2019t govern, when we are dysfunctional, when we don\u2019t even have a speaker of the House. That\u2019s a terrible message.\u201d",

I am a chemical engineer covering the energy sector. Following Oct 8, 2023, 03:33pm EDT | Press play to listen to this article! Got it! Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin ODESSA, TEXAS - MARCH 13: An oil pumpjack setup in a residential neighborhood pulls oil from the ... [+] Permian Basin oil field on March 13, 2022 in Odessa, Texas. The Permian Basin is the largest petroleum-producing basin in the United States. (Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images) Getty Images One of my 2023 energy sector predictions was that U.S. oil production would set a new all-time high this year. After record-setting production thus far this year, it would take a collapse along the lines of the huge Covid drop seen in the spring of 2020 for the U.S. to not set a new annual production record for 2023. For the first three quarters of 2023, U.S. oil production has averaged 12.8 million barrels per day (bpd). The previous annual record \u2014 set in 2019 just before the Covid-19 pandemic impacted production \u2014was 12.3 million bpd. U.S. weekly production at the end of September was 12.9 million bpd. That is 900,000 bpd higher than it was one year earlier. For the entire month of September, production also averaged around 12.9 million bpd, but July\u2019s production was higher than September\u2019s, at 12.99 million bpd. These numbers are just short of the previous monthly record of 13.0 million bpd set in November 2019. The previous record for half a year of production was set in the second half of 2019 at 12.62 million bpd. But the first half of 2023 has slightly beaten that record with a production level of 12.69 million bpd. Unless U.S. production averages 2 million bpd lower in the fourth quarter than current production of 12.9 million bpd, then a new oil production record will be set for the year. With nearly a full quarter to go in 2023, my prediction of a new annual production record is nearly baked in now.

Victoria, Tasmania, South Australia , the Northern Territory and Western Australia already have bans in place while Queensland students will face one from next year. The ACT is asking its residents for feedback on a possible ban. NSW premier Chris Minns stressed the importance of the ban which will apply \u201cacross the board\u201d. He said yesterday: It\u2019s essential to ensure that young people in particular can focus on the schoolwork in front of them and teachers have an attentive class. An explosion in phone use in schools had coincided with declining test scores, he said. He cited UK research that indicated schools with phone bans had better academic outcomes for 16-year-olds. We cannot expect young people to focus on the academic work while they\u2019ve got a phone pinging in their ear every other second. The policy - a Minns government election pledge - will affect 320,000 students in 400 schools.

The single, titled \u2018Talk Different (Raise Your Voice)', comes just ahead of the voice to parliament referendum. It hopes to inspire young people to vote and \u201cserve as a timely reminder that they have the power to create social change\u201d. Founder of Dark Star Music International Ronan Coleman said he saw the referendum as a \u201cgreat opportunity\u201d to bring people together through music: Music is the universal language that brings people together from all walks of life, which is what the proposed constitutional reforms are all about. CEO of Songlines Aboriginal Music, Robbie Bundle, said the project was borne out of a willingness to come together and support one another: The song lyrics are a powerful reminder for people to \u2018use your voice\u2019 and \u2018turn up\u2019, and even though we \u2018walk different\u2019 and \u2018talk different\u2019 essentially, we\u2019re all human, and we all deserve equal human rights and the same chance to lead a happy, healthy life. Director of RedBridge Group, Kos Samaras , said the youth vote will play a critical part in the outcome of the referendum: Gen Z and Millennials make up about 43 percent of the voters. Recent polls show that around 10% of this cohort remain undecided, so a swing towards Yes within this demographic could contribute towards achieving a Yes majority. 15m ago 00.19 BST Monash University staff to begin two-day strike over pay and job security Caitlin Cassidy Union members at Monash University will strike for the longest time in more than a decade in a bid for wage increases, eased workloads and increased job security. It\u2019s the latest round of industrial action to sweep through Victorian universities, following a week-long strike at the University of Melbourne that wrapped up on Friday and a 36-hour strike at RMIT .

Photograph: Wikipedia Updated at 00.33 BST 24m ago 00.10 BST Peter Costello won\u2019t seek third term as Future Fund chair Former treasurer Peter Costello has advised the government he will not seek a third term as chair of the Future Fund. According to a joint statement from treasurer Jim Chalmers and minister for finance Katy Gallagher , Costello advised the government of his decision a fortnight ago. The statement reads: We thank Mr Costello for his significant contribution as a board member and then Chair over the past 14 years. He leaves with the Government\u2019s appreciation and respect. Chalmers and Gallagher note Costello\u2019s \u201cinstrumental\u201d role in establishing the Future Fund in 2006 and setting up its initial investment mandate: Upon the fund\u2019s inception, Mr Costello spoke about the importance of ensuring that Australia could meet its unfunded superannuation obligations without imposing an undue burden on future generations. During his time at the Future Fund, its portfolio has grown steadily and is today worth more than $200 billion. It has delivered an average annual return of 8.8% per annum over the past decade. A formal recruitment process will now commence to appoint a new chair, the statement reads. The government will also carefully consider any future board vacancies as an opportunity to refresh and renew the Future Fund\u2019s leadership.

A moderate flood warning remains in place for the Thomson River downstream of Wandocka. No significant rainfall has been recorded in the 24 hours to 9am Sunday, and no significant rainfall is forecast across the Thomson River catchment over the next few days. The river level is likely to remain above the minor flood level (2.40 m) during Monday.

Albanese said he has put a request in for a phone call, but Netanyahu \u201chas the task at hand that he\u2019s focused on\u201d: We\u2019ve put in a request for a phone call with the prime minister, but I understand that his priority will be organising the defence that needs to occur [there]. Albanese said that across the political spectrum here in Australia, \u201cthis isn\u2019t a partisan issue\u201d. This is one where clearly Hamas has been the aggressor here and \u2026 an attack like this requires substantial planning. The concern about thousands of rockets being shot into Israel, a very dangerous escalation could occur here as well. There\u2019s reports as well of Hezbollah firing rockets into Israel. So, this is a very dangerous time in a volatile part of the world. Of course Israel will defend itself, but of course there should always be restraint when it comes to the targeting of civilians.

This morning he appeared on breakfast television programs to advocate for a yes vote (we brought you this earlier ). The Voice is a simple proposal from Indigenous Australians for practical change. To kick off the last week of the Yes campaign, I talked about it on @sunriseon7 , @TheTodayShow , @ABCTV News Breakfast and @SkyNewsAust First Edition.

Prime minister Anthony Albanese also claimed that \u201csome arrogance has crept into the no side campaign\u201d when asked about polling. But as AAP reports, deputy Liberal leader Sussan Ley argues the country would still have negative outcomes either way after the referendum. She told Sky News: It\u2019s a lose-lose whatever the result is on Saturday. It will be bad, divisive and unhappy for Australians the next day, so we do need to bring the country together. It is just so important that the day after we come together as a country. Updated at 23.32 BST 2h ago 22.58 BST Five men charged over plot to import cocaine through Sydney airport Five men have been charged over an alleged plot to import 100kg of cocaine in the cargo hold of a passenger plane from South Africa. In a statement the Australian federal police said all five men appeared in Parramatta local court yesterday and were remanded in custody to reappear on 30 November. A 42-year-old man is alleged to be the primary Australian facilitator of the plot. A 62-year-old man allegedly coordinated the activities of two men working at Sydney airport as part of the operation. A 55-year-old man and a 61-year-old man allegedly used their employment and access of freight handling operations at the airport to facilitate the removal of five large bags of cocaine from the cargo hold to a secure airside area. These men then allegedly transferred the five bags to a car driven by a 24-year-old man outside the freight terminal. All three men were arrested shortly after the alleged handover on Saturday afternoon. The cocaine haul could have been sold as 100,000 individual street deals, police say, with an estimated street value of $40m. Updated at 23.16 BST 2h ago 22.54 BST Paul Keating backs the voice, saying it will \u2018drastically\u2019 improve Indigenous outcomes Less than a week out from the referendum, former prime minister Paul Keating has voiced his support for the Indigenous voice to parliament. Writing in The Australian , Keating said an Indigenous voice would \u201cdrastically\u201d improve outcomes. He said the idea of a voice has been tried, and \u201cit worked big time\u201d. For this and a host of other reasons, I will be voting Yes on Saturday. In his piece, Keating pointed to consultation employed over seven months between the commonwealth government and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in respect of Native Title. That consultation began in the cabinet room on 27 April, 1993, and finished on 15 November, 1993, seven months later, on the day before, as prime minister, I introduced the Native Title Bill to the House of Representatives. He said this consultation was the \u201cvery first episode of an Indigenous \u2018voice\u2019 speaking directly to the executive government on a matter materially central to Indigenous people\u201d. Last year , Keating \u2013 along with Noel Pearson \u2013 urged Labor not to postpone the voice referendum if it won government. Former prime minister Paul Keating.

In a statement released this morning, the ADA says this represents the \u201csingle biggest threat to the dental profession and access to dental treatments for patients since the start of Covid\u201d. The ADA has written to premiers and first ministers in NSW, Victoria , SA, the ACT and the NT asking them to step in and grant dentists the same amnesty doctors have received. But the ADA said it hasn\u2019t received any noteworthy response. It said this will force many dental practices to either hike prices up considerably during the cost of living crisis, or face bankruptcy. CEO Damian Mitsch is calling on state governments to \u201csit down at the table with us to negotiate a way out of this mess\u201d. Of course dentists want to pay their taxes \u2013 what they don\u2019t want is the unwanted surprise of a backdated tax bill for five or six figure sums that could see them having to close down. The dental peak body is also urging its 17,500 members to write to their local MP to push for the amnesty and stop any backdate which would cripple many businesses.

    "description": "Trey Lance returns to the 49ers' home as the Dallas Cowboys' third quarterback, while the Niners inactivated pass rusher Randy Gregory and running back Elijah Mitchell.",
    "content": "SANTA CLARA \u2014 Two hours before kickoff, Trey Lance was back on the field at Levi\u2019s Stadium, throwing warmup passes as the Cowboys\u2019 No. 3 quarterback, and doing so from about the same spot where he sustained a fractured ankle in last season\u2019s home opener. Then it was reunion time. Once Lance was done throwing, he visited at the midfield logo with several ex-teammates, including 49ers backups Sam Darnold and Brandon Allen, before Brock Purdy emerged for his warmups and stopped for a minute-long chat with Lance. Lance is officially the Cowboys\u2019 No. 3, emergency quarterback behind Dak Prescott and Cooper Rush, as has been the case throughout the season for Dallas (3-1). Unlike Christian McCaffrey suiting up two days after his official trade to the 49ers a year ago, pass rusher Randy Gregory is not being rushed into action following his acquisition Friday from the Denver Broncos, as expected. Gregory is among the 49ers\u2019 deactivated players for tonight\u2019s game against the Dallas Cowboys, Gregory\u2019s initial team from 2015-21 before he joined the Broncos. Also out for the 49ers are running back Elijah Mitchell (knee), tight end Jalen Graham, defensive tackle Kalia Davis, offensive lineman Nick Zakelj, tight end Brayden Willis and Allen, the No. 3 quarterback. Offensive lineman Jon Feliciano (concussion) and wide receiver Jauan Jennings (shin) are cleared to return. This is Mitchell\u2019s second game out, so McCaffrey\u2019s backups at running back are Jordan Mason and Ty Davis-Price, the latter of whom has not had a carry this season. The 49ers elevated Austin Bryant from the practice squad to add depth on the defensive line, which saw Kerry Hyder Jr. released in Friday\u2019s corresponding roster move. Bryant also came up for the season-opening win at Pittsburgh, delivering one pressure and one hurry in 16 snaps. Also summoned from the practice squad Saturday was cornerback Kendall Sheffield, who also came up a week ago and played well on special teams (16 snaps) and had three tackles on defense (11 snaps). For the first time this season, McCaffrey fell out of the NFL\u2019s lead in rushing, albeit before kickoff against the Cowboys. The Miami Dolphins\u2019 Devon Achane ran for 151 yards Sunday, pushing his season total to 460 yards \u2014 one more than McCaffrey\u2019s production in the 49ers\u2019 4-0 start. Achane has just 38 carries (to McCaffrey\u2019s 80) and has five rushing touchdowns in a Dolphins backfield he shares with ex-49er Raheem Mostert, who on Sunday scored his seventh rushing touchdown this year, one better than McCaffrey. McCaffrey has scored in a franchise-record 13 consecutive games. Third among the NFL\u2019s rushing leaders is the Indianapolis Colts\u2019 Zack Moss, whose 165 yards in their win Sunday pushed his season total to 445; Jonathan Taylor had 18 yards in a six-carry season debut. Deactivated by the Cowboys were safety Israel Mukuamu, cornerback Eric Scott, offensive tackle Asim Richards, wide receiver Jalen Brooks, tight end Peyton Hendershot and former San Jose State defensive lineman Viliami Fehoko. Dallas will have for the first time this season its preferred five offensive linemen in the starting lineup, including the return of left tackle Tyron Smith from a two-game absence.",

Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Wong said she did not have \u201cany information at this stage about Australians hospitalised, or injured, or any fatalities\u201d but was working to confirm the welfare of Australians in the affected areas. Albanese later told ABC Sydney it was \u201clikely\u201d that it was not just Israeli citizens who had been kidnapped, given citizens of other nations regularly visit Israel. Australia has changed its travel advice to \u201cdo not travel\u201d to Gaza and near its border, Wong said. Asked about apparent celebrations in some suburbs of Sydney, Wong said \u201cthe targeting of civilians and the taking of hostages is never a cause for celebrations\u201d and Australia would \u201cnever condone\u201d such tactics \u201cwhatever people\u2019s views of the history of this conflict\u201d. Albanese told Channel Nine\u2019s Today program there was \u201cnothing to celebrate by the murder of innocent civilians going about their day\u201d. \u201cSome of those who\u2019ve been captured were young people who were attending a rave, enjoying life, enjoying each other\u2019s company.\u201d Israel has cut off electricity and fuel supplies to Gaza, which may soon affect the strip\u2019s medical facilities that are already under extreme pressure from people injured in the bombardment. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Afternoon Update Free daily newsletter Our Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it matters Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

    "content": "Marvin Mims Jr. had a rookie moment in Week 4 against Chicago, but he hit his first real adversity as a professional Sunday against the Jets. The Broncos\u2019 dynamic rookie wide receiver played a key part in two of Denver\u2019s three turnovers in a 31-21 loss to New York, fumbling a first-quarter punt return and mishandling a third-quarter flip from running back Samaje Perine on a trick play. After the Denver defense started the afternoon with a stop, Mims should have called fair catch on a high punt from Thomas Morstead. Instead, he got hit almost immediately and the ball popped out. The Jets only got a field goal out of the ensuing chance, but even still it set an ominous tone. \u201cI mean, I thought I had a little bit of room and just misjudged it, basically,\u201d Mims told The Denver Post. \u201cJust the speed of the game and all that stuff. As soon as I got my hands on it he hit me and it just fell out.\u201d Then later he tried to take a pitch on an end-around from Perine but it was high and he wasn\u2019t able to corral it. \u201cI just didn\u2019t really get my hands on it and didn\u2019t keep my eye on the ball and it just ended up going over my head,\u201d Mims said. Each team put the ball on the ground four times Sunday, but the Broncos lost three \u2014 the other was Russell Wilson\u2019s game-sealing fumble in the final minute \u2014 while the Jets lost one and recovered three. Broncos running back Javonte Williams went through more than 30 minutes of pregame workouts before the team ultimately made him inactive for Sunday\u2019s game against the Jets. Williams, who injured his hip flexor last week against Chicago, did substantial running and cutting on the field more than two hours before kickoff, but the Broncos decided to be cautious with him. That was despite him being a full participant in Friday\u2019s practice and ramping up his activity throughout the week. Elsewhere on the injury front, defensive lineman D.J. Jones hurt his knee in the first half and did not return to the game. Safety Kareem Jackson left the game briefly, too, but was back in by the end. Safety Justin Simmons returned to action after missing two weeks, played every snap and after the game said he thought he came through it well physically. P.J. Locke wasted little time getting back into action after spending the first four weeks on injured reserve with a dislocated toe. Locke, the reserve safety, was out there for the opening kickoff and jumped right back into core special teams duties for the Broncos. Outside linebacker Ronnie Perkins, meanwhile, made his NFL debut against the Jets. The Broncos signed Perkins off of New England\u2019s practice squad earlier this year. A 2021 third-round draft pick, Perkins had never appeared in an NFL game for the Patriots. He got special teams snaps and rotated in at outside linebacker as well.",

    "content": "A look at the heroes and zeros from the Broncos\u2019 31-21 loss to the New York Jets on Sunday at Empower Field at Mile High. The Broncos feasted on Jets quarterback Zach Wilson in the first quarter. Second-year outside linebacker Nik Bonitto flew off the edge, recording two sacks as he treated Wilson like he was food. Defensive end Zach Allen was impressive, as he had a sack, a forced fumble and a pair of quarterback hits. If only the Broncos could\u2019ve sustain that aggression the entire game. As has been the case whenever he\u2019s been given an opportunity this season, the undrafted rookie was like the Flash on Sunday. On Denver\u2019s first drive, McLaughlin sped down the sideline for a 38-yard gain. Two plays later, McLaughlin bobbled a screen pass from quarterback Russell Wilson but managed to maintain possession before running 22 yards for a touchdown. Denver\u2019s former edge rusher might be the biggest winner of the week. Gregory managed to escape the horror show in Denver after the Broncos traded him to the San Francisco 49ers. He leaves a 1-4 team and joins a Super Bowl contender while pocketing $28 million in guaranteed money from Denver. He deserves a huge shout out because he is winning at life right now. The Broncos looked like they had another double-digit comeback in them. Cornerback Pat Surtain II intercepted a pass in the red zone before Wilson completed a 20-yard pass to wide receiver Jerry Jeudy on third-and-14. But then the Broncos once again shot themselves in the foot. Wilson fumbled the ball while escaping pressure and Jets cornerback Bryce Hall recovered and scored on a 39-yard touchdown. A big mistake that now has Denver at 1-4. The Broncos have won five straight coin tosses and elected to defer each time. Maybe it\u2019s time for Denver to just take the ball to start games. On Sunday, the Broncos once again failed to score on the first drive of the third quarter. The Broncos were forced to punt on two straight drives while the Jets scored 10 straight to take a 18-13 lead. It didn\u2019t take long for the Jets to realize the key to beating Denver\u2019s defense was to stop letting Zach Wilson throw the ball and run the rock. Second-year running back Breece Hall picked apart Denver, rushing for 177 yards on 22 carries. On the Jets\u2019 first drive of the second half, he cruised to the end zone on a 72-yard touchdown to take a 15-13 lead. Earlier in the second quarter, the Jets rushed nine straight times for 67 yards then settled for a field goal to cut the deficit to 10-8. New York\u2019s rushing total at the end of the night: 234 yards and plenty of Broncos missed tackles.",

    "description": "The Avlanche trimmed the roster on Sunday with the initial Monday deadline looming, but there could be further alterations between now and opening night Wednesday in Los Angeles.",
    "content": "The deadline for the Colorado Avalanche to set their initial roster is Monday, and there were a couple of surprises in the past two days. Every NHL team is allowed a maximum of 23 players on the active roster from Monday through the trade deadline in March. There were no surprises among the players still on the Avs roster after practice Sunday, but the club made more cuts than expected. Forward Ben Meyers and defenseman Sam Malinski were assigned to the Colorado Eagles, while forward Riley Tufte was placed on waivers. The Avs put defensemen Brad Hunt and Jack Achan on waivers Saturday, and both cleared so they\u2019re eligible to join the Eagles. If everyone who is not participating in training camp because of injury goes on injured reserve as expected, the Avalanche will have 21 players on the active roster, not the maximum 23. One player who did earn a spot is Fredrik Olofsson. He won the competition for the fourth-line center role, and Bednar confirmed he\u2019s made the club. He skated between Andrew Cogliano and Logan O\u2019Connor at practice Sunday. \u201cWe have a need at center and Olofsson had a great camp,\u201d Bednar said. \u201cHe\u2019s played well for us and has a little bit of experience. So he wins that center job, and we don\u2019t have any more room for now. I thought all of those guys did a nice job and we\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d Things can still change between the Monday deadline and Wednesday night in Los Angeles when the Avs open their season against the Kings. They could attempt to claim any of the numerous players from other clubs who were also on waivers Sunday. The Avalanche could also recall any of the players who were sent to the Eagles on Tuesday or Wednesday, provided they have the necessary space below the $83.5 million salary cap ceiling. That is where this could be tricky. Captain Gabe Landeskog is expected to miss the entire season, and his $7 million will land on long-term injured reserve Monday. The Avs are then allowed to go over the $83.5 million cap, which they are already planning for with some of their offseason additions. The key to the early-season roster may be goalie Pavel Francouz, who has been absent from camp and the club has offered no timeline on a return. According to CapFriendly\u2019s roster-building tools, the Avs would have $2.525 million in space with the current 21-man roster \u2026 if Francouz also goes on LTIR. If Francouz is placed on LTIR, he has to miss a minimum of the first 10 games of the season. If Francouz goes on regular injured reserve, he doesn\u2019t count toward the 23-man roster limit, but his $2 million cap hit remains. And that wouldn\u2019t leave the Avs with enough room to add a 22nd or 23rd player. There is one guy among the 21 players remaining in camp who isn\u2019t sure if he\u2019ll be ready for Wednesday \u2014 Cogliano. He wore a normal practice jersey Sunday for the first time in camp, shedding the non-contact sweater. But neither he nor Bednar was ready to pronounce him ready for the opener as he works his way back from two neck fractures sustained during the Seattle series in April. If Cogliano can\u2019t play Wednesday and the Avs don\u2019t add someone to the roster between now and then, Kurtis MacDermid would likely slot in on the fourth line. \u201cIn terms of the fractures, they are completely healed,\u201d Cogliano said. \u201cNow it\u2019s about everything that goes with the muscles and just making sure I\u2019m comfortable. I\u2019m close.\u201d",

    "content": "What is it going to take for the Broncos offense to start a second half in rhythm? They\u2019ve deferred the coin toss each of the first five games this year and those half-openers have finished in four three-and-outs and a missed field goal. Sean Payton\u2019s offense netted minus-16 yards on four third-quarter possessions against the Jets. Even two drives that stalled inside the New York 5-yard line in the first half looked pretty by comparison. Denver ran it all over New York early on and then did nothing \u2014 for long stretches literally less than nothing \u2014 most of the rest of the afternoon. Wilson mounted a 75-yard touchdown drive to get the Broncos within 24-21 with 4:44 to go, but then fumbled about 20 yards short of field goal range in the final minute. Ouch. He got battered all day by a barrage of pressure and hits from the Jets\u2019 dominating front four. The best thing to be said about Vance Joseph\u2019s group on Sunday is that it didn\u2019t allow a touchdown to the Jets in their first five red zone trips. But that\u2019s not to say the Denver defense played well. Jets quarterback Zach Wilson showed early on he wasn\u2019t to be trusted, but Nathaniel Hackett and company didn\u2019t really have to. They just ran the ball all over the Broncos. Breece Hall\u2019s 72-yard touchdown run served as the big hit on an afternoon of bruising body blows. Pat Surtain II did his best to put the Broncos in position to pull a rabbit out of the hat at the end, picking off Zach Wilson late to give the offense one more chance at it, but that wasn\u2019t enough. The day started with a big mistake and never got much better. Marvin Mims, Jr, who has made several big plays early in his rookie year, fumbled for the second straight week. This time, he didn\u2019t get it back and it set up a Jets field goal after the defense had forced an opening-drive stop. They also recovered a fumble later when Tremon Smith jumped on a muffed punt. Special teamer of the week: Jets kicker Greg Zuerlein, who hit all five of his field goal attempts. It might not have been the worst coaching job in the history of the NFL, but it certainly wasn\u2019t good. The Jets entered averaging 15.5 points and ran roughshod over Joseph\u2019s defense. The Broncos couldn\u2019t figure out a way to move the ball for the middle half of the game. They put it on the ground too much, didn\u2019t get open enough and didn\u2019t protect Wilson enough. And Wilson himself played his worst game of the season against the first real, tough defense on the schedule. It doesn\u2019t get easier from here for the 1-4 Broncos, with a short turnaround before flying to Kansas City for a Thursday night game and the Chiefs on the schedule again shortly after that before a Week 9 bye week. Tough sledding ahead.",

    "content": "Initial thoughts from Broncos\u2019 31-21 loss to the New York Jets in Week 5 at Empower Field at Mile High: : It\u2019s time. Time to bring back the D. It just feels right. The flying Bronco had his time. And it was glorious. Four Super Bowl trips. Three Lombardi Trophies. John Elway\u2019s helicopter run. Von Miller tugging on Superman\u2019s cape. But it just isn\u2019t the D. The Broncos\u2019 Snowcapped helmets were a nice reminder of that Sunday, even if the all-orange pants and tops that accompanied them were a complete abomination. The old is new again, and it should be here to stay. : Five games in, there is no longer a debate. Jaleel McLaughlin is Denver\u2019s most explosive running back, and getting him the ball 12-15 times a game should be a top priority. Head coach Sean Payton appeared to agree Sunday (at least early on). The undrafted free agent was the first running back on the field, and he had seven touches for 83 yards and a touchdown by halftime \u2014 marking the third time in four games McLaughlin has scored. If only he\u2019d gotten a few more opportunities (five touches) in the second half. : The Broncos lost this game in so many ways. But if you want to pinpoint one particular area that cost the Broncos dearly, it has to be their two trips inside the 10-yard line in the first half. All told, the Broncos ran six plays inside the Jets\u2019 10 over the first two quarters. Total yards gained: 6. Points left on the field: 8. Payton\u2019s two third-and-goal calls? A Russell Wilson designed draw from the 5, and a Marvin Mims Jr. screen from the 8. And not one ball thrown into the end zone. Not great, Sean. : There were so many reasons why it was a good idea to say goodbye to edge rusher Randy Gregory. First among them: This Nik Bonitto guy is pretty darn good at rushing the quarterback. The second-year pro out of Oklahoma registered two-plus sacks for the second Sunday in a row and was generally a nuisance off the edge. The one problem? The Broncos still don\u2019t have a run stopper. And that isn\u2019t getting fixed anytime soon \u2014 especially with tackle D.J. Jones now injured. Which means lots of long runs like the one Breece Hall ripped off in the third quarter. : The Jets did everything they could to hand the Broncos this game. Muffed punt? Yup. Woeful \u201cGold Zone\u201d execution from offensive coordinator Nathaniel Hackett\u2019s boys? The Jets were 0-for-5. Completely unnecessary throw \u2014 in Pat Surtain II\u2019s direction no less \u2014 resulting in an ill-timed interception? Oh yeah, Hackett was playing the old hits. And yet, none of it mattered in the end. Payton and the Broncos still walked away losers to Jets QB Zach Wilson for the second time in a calendar year \u2014 both at home. If that isn\u2019t an indictment of the current state of the franchise, we don\u2019t know what is.",

    "content": "Spider-Man: Freshman Year has been in the works for quite a while, but the release window might be sooner than you'd think with a new listing reportedly revealing a release window and voice cast for the new animated series! Marvel Studios first announced this new animated take on Spider-Man as part of Disney+ Day back in 2021, but few concrete details have unfortunately been revealed in the years since. Tackled by Polygon Pictures, a prominent studio behind anime releases such as Pacific Rim: The Black , Netflix's Godzilla film trilogy, and more, this new Spider-Man could be hitting as early as next year. According to a copyright listing for the series with the United States government, Spider-Man: Freshman Year could be releasing around a projected release of around November 2, 2024 with an anticipated completion for \"Episode 101\" specifically potentially being around December 15th this year. These listings are far from concrete and could change at any time, but it also comes with the potential reveal of the full voice cast featured in the series' premiere episode . (Photo: Polygon Pictures / Marvel Studios) Spider-Man: Freshman Year Voice Cast According to the copyright listing for the first episode of Spider-Man: Freshman Year the voice cast includes the likes of Hudson Thames (who would be returning from What If...? ) as Peter Parker, Eugene Byrd ( Spidey and His Amazing Friends, 8 Mile ) as Lonnie Lincoln, Grace Song ( Kidding ) as Nico Minoru, Hugh Dancy ( Hannibal ) as Otto Octavius, Kari Wahlgren ( FLCL, Rick and Morty ) as Aunt May, and Zeno Robinson ( My Hero Academia, Pokemon Master Journeys: The Series ) as Harry Osborn . Spider-Man: Freshman Year previously teased that fans will see Peter Parker come into his own as Spider-Man with a new take on the MCU in this animated series , and confirmed that Charlie Cox will be reprising his role as Matt Murdock / Daredevil with Paul F. Tompkins announced as Bentley Wittman / Wizard. These have been the only confirmed voice cast additions since the series was first announced, so this listing is subject to change as the animated series continues its production.

    "description": "\"Deux Amours\" reveals how Daryl Dixon gets to France.",
    "content": "[This story contains spoilers for The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon episode 5.] \"How did you end up here, so far from home?\" asked Azlan (Hassam Ghancy) in Sunday's \" Deux Amours \" penultimate episode of Daryl Dixon . The first episode of the Walking Dead spin-off started with Daryl (Norman Reedus) adrift at sea and washing ashore in France , somehow thousands of miles from his home at the Commonwealth in Ohio. As Daryl trekked the French countryside from Marseille to Lourdes, it wasn't until the premiere's final scene \u2014 set in a port at La Havre, northern France \u2014 that we received clues about \"the American\" who went overboard in the Gulf of C\u00e0diz. We saw the ship's captain (Gr\u00e8gory Kristoforoff) report to Madame Genet (Anne Charrier) that its prisoners escaped during a mutiny. We heard a French doctor (Fran\u00e7ois Delaive) reveal the ship was transporting zombie test subjects . And we learned that the doctor's research was \"largely destroyed.\" Who was it that destroyed a ship that took three years to make seaworthy? \"He was named... Dixon,\" the captain answered. But why was Daryl on a transatlantic vessel freighting zombie test subjects overseas? That was answered in \"Deux Amours\" when Azlan, a member of Union de L'Espoir (Union of Hope), shepherded Daryl and Laurent (Louis Puech Scigliuzzi) to The Nest up north. As they made the 124-mile trip toward Mont-Saint-Michel, Normandy, flashbacks revealed that Daryl was in Freeport, Maine, when his bike ran out of fuel. A camo-clad man named Jones (Gilbert Glenn Brown) happened across Daryl and brought him to an auto repair shop, where he laid out the ground rules for a motley crew of strays: no fighting, no stealing, no sexual deviancy of any kind. \"No children will be accepted, nor elderly or shorties. Five foot, four inches is the cut-off.\" It's one pint of ethanol per head, or a quart for \"fresh ones.\" \"What do you want 'em for, anyway?\" asked Juno (John Ales), only to be told \"this is not your concern.\" As it turned out, Jones was working with the French doctor who has been conducting experiments on zombie test subjects for Genet. After contacting Carol (Melissa McBride) and promising to return to the Commonwealth within the week, Daryl set out with his crossbow and ropes to wrangle walkers and turn them in for enough fuel to get home. But when Daryl deduced that Juno murdered an inexperienced younger guy named TJ (Martin Martinez) to exchange his freshly-turned trophy for an extra quart of gas, a fight broke out and landed Daryl and Juno in the brig of a cargo ship. The French doctor was aboard conducting experiments on walkers, some caged with a warning sign reading \" fast ne pas nourir \": FAST DO NOT FEED. The cargo: shipping containers filled with walkers. After watching French guards manning the ship throw a man to the les affam\u00e8s \u2014 the hungry ones \u2014 to be eaten alive, Daryl and Juno plotted an escape and mutinied against the guards. Daryl unleashed the caged hungry ones on the crew before freeing the other prisoners, racing for a lifeboat as the zombies flooded the ship. During the chaos, the French doctor's experiments got loose. A super-strong variant walker ripped free from its restraints, ran up stairs, and tore Juno apart with its bare hands, sending the lifeboat plunging into the ocean. Daryl went overboard just as the ship exploded, strapped himself to the overturned lifeboat, and drifted through the Mediterranean Sea until he washed ashore in Marseille. There are rumors of active ships going in and out of La Havre, but the port is controlled by Genet and her Guerrier (warriors). If Daryl hopes to make it home, he'll need to deliver Laurent to The Nest at Mont-Saint-Michel so that Union de L'Espoir's leader \u2014 the Buddhist monk Losang \u2014 can secure him passage back to America. New episodes of The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon premiere Sundays on AMC and AMC+.

    "description": "Who \"came back\" on The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon?",
    "content": "[This story contains spoilers for The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon episode 5.] \"Who came back?\" That was the question Daryl (Norman Reedus) asked Carol (guest star Melissa McBride) over the radio in Sunday's \" Deux Amours \" episode of The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon. The penultimate episode of the first season took a detour to Freeport, Maine, for a back-and-forth flashback sequence revealing how Daryl wound up on a zombie-freighting French cargo ship , only to go overboard in the Gulf of C\u00e0diz before washing ashore in France . And while we got answers about the \"what,\" \"when,\" \"where,\" and \"why\" of it all, the \"who\" question remains: WHO CAME BACK? The Walking Dead series finale ended with Daryl leaving Carol and the Grimes children at the Commonwealth community in Ohio with a promise: \"While I'm out there, if I hear anything, see anything, I'll find them both. I'll bring them home.\" Daryl then rode off on his bike to go find Rick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln) and Michonne (Danai Gurira), who will return in their 2024 spin-off series titled The Walking Dead: The Ones Who Live . Daryl's solo travels brought him to the coastal town of Freeport, Maine, about a week's trip out from the Commonwealth. After his bike ran out of fuel, Daryl happened across Jones (Gilbert Glenn Brown) and a French doctor (Fran\u00e7ois Delaive) trading ethanol for \"live\" walkers: no children, no elderly, none shorter than five feet, four inches, and extra fuel for the freshly turned. As it turned out, these walkers would be shipped overseas as the zombie test subjects of French Pouvoir des Vivants leader Madame Genet (Anne Charrier). Before a hoodwinked Daryl ended up in the ship's brig and shipped across the Atlantic Ocean, he made radio contact with Carol. The connection was weak, but lasted long enough for Daryl and Carol to say the following through radio static: Carol: Hello. Are you there? Daryl: Hello! Hey! It's me! Carol: Daryl. Are you okay? Daryl: Yeah, well, I have a radio here. I thought, what the hell? How you doing? Carol: Where's there? Daryl: I'm in Maine, by the coast. Everything good there? Carol: Yeah, you know, pretty quiet here. Daryl: Quiet's good. You okay? Carol: Yeah. Just takes some getting used to, that's all. [A beat.] Daryl: You sure you're okay? Carol: You never have to worry about me, Daryl. How is it out there? Daryl: I'll tell you all about it when I see you. I'm just gathering up some fuel. I'll be there in about a week. I promise. Carol: Copy that. Hey, Daryl. Daryl: Yeah. Carol: [Static, transmission breaking up] ...came back. Daryl: Who came back? [Static] Daryl: Carol. Who came back? Carol? So, who came back? Rick Grimes Daryl watched as Rick sacrificed himself by blowing up a bridge to stop a walker horde, then spent the next six years looking for a body. Only Jadis (Pollyanna McIntosh) knows what happened next: she flew away with the gravely wounded Rick aboard a CRM helicopter and trafficked him to the Civic Republic . Jadis then became a high-ranking official in the Civic Republic Military as Rick repeatedly tried to escape his fate as a walker-clearing worker at a Civic Republic Cull Facility in Philadelphia. Michonne When Michonne followed a stranger named Virgil (Kevin Carroll) to Bloodsworth Island in Maryland, it was for weapons to help the Alexandrians win the Whisperer War. What Michonne found instead was evidence that Rick survived \u2014 and then set off to find her husband and bring him home. Daryl eventually found out the truth about Michonne's mission when Judith Grimes (Cailey Fleming) revealed her secret , confessing Michonne believes Rick is alive. Michonne was heading north with a massive caravan of survivors before continuing her search as a lone, katana-wielding samurai in The Ones Who Live . Morgan Jones Spoiler alert for Fear the Walking Dead season 8. After a seven-year time jump, Morgan Jones' (Lennie James) story on Fear the Walking Dead came full circle with the pilot episode of The Walking Dead when Morgan radioed Rick Grimes . \"I'm gonna come and look for you, whether you're at Alexandria or not,\" Morgan said into the dead air of a walkie-talkie. \"I will leave this message every morning at dawn, and I'll leave the walkie on for a few minutes after. Who knows? Maybe you might even be listening.\" We last saw Morgan at Eastman's cemetery in Georgia, far from Rick's home in Alexandria, Virginia. But it's a trek that Morgan made before when he tracked Rick's group from Georgia to Virginia back in season 5 of The Walking Dead , only to later leave Virginia for Texas. If Morgan made his way back to Alexandria, he'd find some of its residents relocated to the Commonwealth in Ohio. Dwight \"You go, and you keep going. Don't you ever come back here again. If I ever see your face around here again, I'll kill you.\" Those are the last words that Daryl said to ex-Savior Dwight (Austin Amelio) on the \"Wrath\" episode of The Walking Dead season 8. More than seven years after Daryl banished Dwight from Virginia, he'll return to old haunts with his wife Sherry (Christine Evangelista) in the final episodes of Fear the Walking Dead : Dwight and Sherry can be seen visiting their old house and Negan's (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) long-abandoned Sanctuary. Heath Heath (Corey Hawkins) has been MIA since disappearing during season 7 of The Walking Dead , but the former supply runner for the Alexandria Safe-Zone is unlikely to merit a mention in that conversation between Daryl and Carol. Years have passed at this point, and Heath's fate \u2014 Jadis secretly trafficked him to the CRM , leaving behind a mysterious card with the letters \"PPP\" \u2014 remains a loose end .

    "description": "TWD: Daryl Dixon episode 5 recap, \"Deux Amours\" (\"Two Loves\").",
    "content": "\"Vers elle s'en va tout mon espoir. J'ai deux amours. Mon pays et Paris. (Towards her goes all my hope. I have two loves: my country and Paris).\" Josephine Baker's \" J'ai Deux Amours \" (\"I Have Two Loves\") plays as Daryl Dixon (Norman Reedus) and Laurent (Louis Puech Scigliuzzi) drift down the river on a boat steered by Azlan (Hassam Ghancy). Their destination is The Nest: \"A special place,\" Azlan assures Daryl. \"A home for the soul.\" Daryl washed ashore in France as l'\u00e2me perdue , a lost soul, far from his home in America. Azlan asks if Daryl is Christian. Daryl answers honestly: no, and he was kicked out of Sunday school. \"In the Bible, Abram becomes a pilgrim after the Lord tells him, 'Go from your country and your kindred and your father's house, to the land that I will show you,'\" Azlan responds, quoting Genesis 12:1. To that, Daryl quips: \"I'm guessing Abram didn't end up in France.\" Azlan asks another question, causing Daryl's mind to drift: \" How did you end up here, so far from home ?\" THEN . America. Maine. Daryl walks his bike down a road and grips his knife when a camouflage-clad man named Jones (Gilbert Glenn Brown) stops his truck behind him. Daryl is as curt as he is cautious. Need help, friend? \"Nah, I'm good.\" Where you headed? \"Headed home.\" On a bike with no fuel, huh? \"You got some to spare?\" Well, depends. You any good with that thing? Jones escorts Daryl to an auto repair shop. Inside is a motley crew of blue collar types \u2014 who don't seem the type to speak the language coming over the shop's radio. French. The haggard Juno (John Ales) ribs a younger guy, TJ (Martin Martinez), over a picture of his girl back home. Jones rounds up the men and lays down the ground rules: no fighting, no stealing, no sexual deviancy of any kind. \"No children will be accepted, nor elderly or shorties,\" Jones explains. \"Five foot, four inches is the cut-off.\" Juno asks what they want 'em for, but a French doctor (Fran\u00e7ois Delaive) \u2014 the same man from the French cargo ship at La Havre \u2014 tells him it's \"not your concern.\" All they need to know, according to Jones, is their pay is one pint of ethanol per head. Juno protests: they were told a quart. The French doctor guarantees \"a quart for the fresh ones.\" TJ figures their chances are better in numbers, but nobody wants to take the green-looking kid up on his offer. Daryl hunts walkers in the woods, bounding them with ropes two at a time. At the auto shop, Juno's gang leads muzzled walkers linked by chains toward the \"party room\": a flashing strobe light inside a trailer. The French doctor supervises as Juno hands over his trophies \u2014 five in all, including a fresh one that can't be more than a few months turned. Daryl leads his six-walker haul back to the shop and collects his gas canister, with more to come tomorrow. TJ laments coming up empty-handed. Daryl sympathizes with the kid's tough break, but his only pointer? \"Go home to your girl.\" He's trying, but he needs fuel. TJ asks Daryl if he needs a partner \u2014 you know, for a cut of the gas. \"Do I look like I need help?\" NOW . Azlan ties the boat to a tree and leads Daryl to their camp for the night: a hideout with a stash of noise-making cans to alert them of any les affam\u00e8s (hungry ones). As Azlan goes to pray, Daryl shows Laurent how to gut and cook a fish. He misses Isabelle, who stayed behind in Paris so that Daryl and Laurent could escape the city. When Daryl says they all have people they miss, Laurent gets him to open up about his friends back home: \"There's Judith and RJ. They're kids, like you. There's Connie, Ezekiel. There's a lady named Carol.\" Laurent says Daryl's friends sound nice \u2014 and he can tell Daryl misses Issa, too. \"Not to worry,\" Laurent assures him. \"We'll all be together again.\" Meanwhile, Isabelle (Cl\u00e9mence Po\u00e9sy) wakes up in an opulent room next to Les N\u00e8nuphars: The Water Lilies . Issa, like the painting, is the latest addition to Quinn's (Adam Nagaitis) well-guarded mansion. Quinn reports that he's just met with the Pouvoir , who told him that Laurent made it out of Paris and is headed north with her American friend. He asks how long it's going to take for her to see him different. \"Everything happens for a reason,\" he says. \"Isn't that what God's all about?\" When Issa says that God loves the sinner, Quinn responds: \"So there's hope for me, then.\" Quinn leaves her to pray, which she does in private: \"God, forgive me for what I'm about to do.\" In her hands, a makeshift shiv. Back at the camp, Laurent says a prayer for Judith, RJ, Carol, Connie, and Ezekiel in America \"'cause Daryl doesn't know how to pray.\" Daryl notices Azlan's pocket watch, which he says saved his life. He then asks about the rumors of La Havre being \"the only place you can find something still floating.\" The port is controlled by Madame Genet and her Guerrier , Azlan explains, but the Union de L'Espoir's leader, the Buddhist monk Losang , will help Daryl secure a boat home to America. \"A lone wolf who only wants to get back to his pack,\" Azlan points out. Daryl says he made a promise. To that, Azlan tells him, \"There are times when even a man's promise gets overwhelmed by a connection other people or a larger cause.\" Daryl admits causes were never his thing. \"When a man dies in someone else's war, it's his kids that suffer,\" Daryl says. \"That gets passed down to their kids. After a while, no one even remembers what 'the cause' was.\" Azlan explains how the watch saved his life: when he arrived at The Nest, he had just lost his wife and son and wished to die. Losang asked him to fix the pocketwatch \u2014 so he worked on it, day and night, for months. \"When I finally got it running, he told me he didn't want it anymore. Because I had found a reason to live.\" Daryl overhears Laurent pray, this time for himself: to be strong like Daryl is strong. THEN . Daryl fills his bike's gas tank and overhears Drew (Tercelin Kirtley) laughing off TJ's offer to partner up. Juno tells the kid they'll consider letting him tag along if he chops firewood and stokes their fire over night, so Daryl teaches him how to chop wood. TJ says he's from just outside Freeport, a couple miles up the road. He promised his girl he'd take her far away from her father, so he can't go back without any fuel. Their destination is California. \"I hear it's better there.\" Or, at least, \"It's gotta be better than this, right?\" NOW . As the Demimonde's Anna (Lukerya Ilyashenko) arrives at Quinn's mansion, he attempts to repair their toxic relationship from 12 years ago. He can be a better man for her. With that, Isabelle takes his head, leads him to the bed, seduces him, grips her shiv... \"After all, Abraham sacrificed his only son. But Isaac was saved. And in the end, Abraham was redeemed. I believe in redemption,\" Quinn says. \"And I know you do, too.\" Ultimately, she doesn't exact her plan, and Quinn leaves the room to see a drunkened Anna angrily storm away. At the camp, Daryl's thoughts again drift back to Maine. THEN . A radio operator (Avant Strangel) connects Daryl with a friend from home, but warns the connection only lasts a few minutes. Through static comes the voice of Carol (Melissa McBride), calling from the Commonwealth in Ohio. He's in Maine, near the coast. They catch up. \"Pretty quiet here,\" she reports. Daryl responds, \"Quiet's good. You okay?\" She says it takes some getting used to, that's all \u2014 helping lead the Commonwealth, being away from her best friend. He notices something is off. \"You sure you're okay?\" \"You never have to worry about me, Daryl. How is it out there?\" He'll tell her about it when he sees her next. He's gathering fuel, and he'll be back at the Commonwealth in about a week. \"I promise.\" Through the static, Carol copies. \"Hey, Daryl...\" The transmission breaks up and returns, just in time for Daryl to hear the end of Carol's message: \"...came back.\" Who came back? Carol? Static. Who came back? Carol? NOW. A hungry one wanders into camp. Daryl and Laurent find Azlan pinned to a tree \u2014 impaled. He slipped fighting off the hungry ones. He's covered in blood and can't move. \"All those years of training,\" he says weakly, \"and I'm done in by a telephone pole.\" Daryl can only call it a \"tough break.\" Azlan musters enough strength to chuckle: \"At least we know God has a sense of humor. My father worked for the phone company all his life. Just get the boy to The Nest.\" Azlan hands Daryl his watch, which contains an image of Mont-Saint-Michel, Normandy. \"Follow the river. You'll find it. And beware of telephone poles. I'm at peace, Monsieur Dixon. The boy is in good hands. And I'm facing east. Here. Use my knife to do it.\" Daryl accepts. \"Truly to Him we shall return.\" With that, Azlan dies and is buried by Daryl. Laurent lays prayer beads on his grave. At the river, Daryl finds the rope tied to the tree has been severed and their boat gone. The culprit: Laurent. Daryl tears into the boy, demanding an explanation as he yells curses like \"you stupid little shit!\" and \"worthless!\" He wants to know why. Why?! \"Everyone I care about is gone,\" a tearful Laurent confesses. \"When we get to The Nest, you'll go, too. I don't want to be alone.\" Daryl softens. And he holds the boy close. Back at Quinn's, a maid delivers fresh eggs with a side of secret message. In the woods, Daryl assures Laurent that there are good people at The Nest. Laurent wants to come with Daryl, but he can't. Daryl told Isabelle he would deliver Laurent to The Nest, and she'll come looking for him there. Laurent begs to let him come \u2014 he'll do as he's told, and he'll only have to learn things once. \"It ain't about that,\" Daryl says. What's it about? Before Daryl can answer, the sound of Guerrier trucks force them to flee into the woods, leaving Laurent's belongings behind. THEN . Juno returns to the auto shop with freshly-reanimated walkers \u2014 including a zombified TJ. Juno claims they found the kid out there already turned, but Daryl notices rope burns on TJ's neck. \"A quart's a quart, you prick,\" Juno scoffs. \"You snooze, you lose.\" Daryl punches Juno in the face. Jones breaks up the fight: no fighting. A pissed Daryl yells \"he killed him\" as he's forced out with Juno. NOW . Daryl hands over his knife and instructs Laurent to follow the river until he finds the place in Azlan's watch. He'll be right behind him. As Laurent takes off into the woods, the Guerrier find Laurent's things: his books and Rubik's cube. Daryl is captured and forced to his knees. \"No comprende,\" he tells a French-speaking warrior. They want to know where the boy is. Daryl plays dumb, so they hit him in the face and threaten to take his eyes if he doesn't give up Laurent. \"F\u2014 you,\" Daryl spits back. As the Guerrier go to remove Daryl's left eye, Laurent gives himself up. In Paris, Quinn gifts Isabelle a diamond necklace. Madame Genet has invited him to a gathering at the Maison M\u00e8re hotel for De Gaulle Day, named in honor of Free France leader Charles De Gaulle, architect of France's Fifth Republic. Genet, leader of the Pouvoir des Vivants , \"needs people like me that can get their hands on things,\" Quinn explains. Arriving at Maison M\u00e8re, Isabelle spots Sylvie (La\u00efka Blanc-Francard) and Fallou (Eriq Ebouaney) with Emile (Tristan Zanchi) and Nadine (Chrystal Boursin) in the crowd. Inside, Madame Genet (Anne Charrier) receives Isabelle and Quinn as her forces torture a man in a nearby room \u2014 one of her Guerriers charged with securing the city accepted a bribe \"to allow people out we wanted to keep in.\" The sight of Anna and the soldier Codron (Romain Levi) means she sold Quinn out to Genet. Isabelle spots Daryl locked inside a cell. \"You've got no idea what you've done,\" Quinn tells Anna. She kisses him goodbye and leaves him to his fate without another word. Quinn attempts to explain himself to Genet, but she has him imprisoned alongside Daryl. Genet then reunites Isabelle with Laurent, admitting that she sees now \"why people fall for it.\" \"A special child, born from the curse. Life from death, Mother Mary, Phoenix from the ashes. It hits all the notes, doesn't it?\" Genet says of Laurent's miracle birth to a zombified mother . Finally, it's revealed why Genet is after Laurent: she wants the boy to make an appearance at her De Gaulle Day rally. \"Some people think that the l'Union de I'Espoir is against me,\" she explains to Isabelle. \"We must show them the truth. That we are all one French people. I've been trying to make that clear to him.\" Isabelle instructs Laurent to do as she asks and not anger Genet further. \"You are not angry,\" he tells Genet. \"Your heart is broken.\" In their cell, Quinn complains about holding up his end of the deal and scolds Daryl for not doing his part. THEN . Daryl and Juno are rounded up and brought aboard a cargo ship in chains when Daryl spots a lifeboat. They're marched past a room where walker experiments are being conducted by the French doctor. A warning sign reads: \" Fast ne pas nourir .\" FAST DO NOT FEED. Shipping containers are filled with caged walkers \u2014 and a container filled with living prisoners. Juno protests being put inside the feeding pen, but gets no answers as he demands the French guards tell them where the ship is headed. \"WHERE ARE YOU TAKING US?!\" The ship sets sail and is somewhere in the Gulf of C\u00e0diz when the guards open the cell, club a man, drag him toward the caged walkers... and throw him inside to be eaten alive by the hungry ones. NOW . A guard fetches Daryl from the cell, cuffs him, and says it's \"lunch time.\" Genet explains to Laurent what will happen: there will be a speech, then a show of sorts, and then he'll make his appearance. Above a gladiator-style arena, Genet addresses the French people assembled for De Gaulle Day. In French, she thanks the \"brave\" who have traveled \u2014 from Saint Denis to the Rive Guache, Montmartre, to la Chapelle \u2014 to celebrate their rebirth and the rise of the 6th Republic. \"Today, and ever after, we will be free, and strong, and unafraid! We have all felt lost at times, far from the life we knew. Deprived of the people we loved. In a hopeless world, it would have been so easy to give up. But we did not give up. In the name of all those we loved. In the name of all those we lost. We kept going. Living. As we must continue to do. Not for ourselves. But for the future. Years from now, you will tell your grandchildren you were here. Now. The day we ushered in a new France! A France free of the tyranny of the elite, that welcomes in all friends. With hope for a future. Because, yes, the world is simple now. There are friends. And there are enemies. The enemies want to go back to the way things were, when the few controlled the many.\" THEN . Daryl coughs up blood as a panicked Juno alerts the guards. \"He's puking blood! If he dies in here, he's gonna turn!\" The guard hauls Daryl toward the feeding cage, forcing him to his knees to face a dozen walkers. Daryl fights back, throwing one guard into the pit before shooting another dead and choking out the feeder until his neck breaks. Daryl frees Juno and the rest of the prisoners, unleashing the caged walkers onto the ship's crew. The two Americans head for the lifeboats as walkers flood the ship. Zombie mutiny! NOW . Genet's guards march Daryl down a hall toward the arena. Genet's speech continues: \"They took everything, bringing pain and suffering down on those who could least bear it, profiting all the while. Finally, out of greed and hubris, they unleashed this plague on the world. They made us pay for being poor, vulnerable, meek. But remember what the Bible says about the meek. We're not meek anymore! The world is ours, now. So today, we will make our enemies pay! We have all felt the anguish. We have all suffered loss. Loss binds us! Loss gives us our power! They gave us this disease! But I want you to see today the power our future holds. Because their disease can also be our cure. Power to the Living!\" The crowd chants, \"Pouvoir!\" Daryl is thrown into the arena. Above him, Genet's audience looks down at the American and yell: VIVE LA FRANCE! LONG LIVE FRANCE! THEN . Daryl and Juno cut the lifeboat loose, but in the chaos of the mutiny, the French doctor's zombie experiments are set free. A variant walker bursts free from its restraints and RUNS. The walker climbs stairs and attacks Juno, knocking him into a red button and sending the lifeboat plunging into the ocean. The strong walker rips Juno apart with inhuman strength . NOW . Pouvoir guards drop a halberd into the arena and march out Daryl's opponent: a muzzled hungry one. As Genet and Codron look on, a guard fires a dart into the walker's neck, injecting it with a serum. THEN . Daryl bludgeons the super-strong walker, but it doesn't die. With a burst of speed, the walker charges Daryl... who jumps over the rail just as an explosion rocks the ship. NOW . The muzzled walker convulses as the serum infects its blood stream. Veins bulge. Its blackened eyes turn red. The walker breaks free from its chains, and free from its muzzle, snarls. \"Dixon! Dixon,\" Codron yells out. \"Today, you die... for my brother!\" Vive la Dixon? New episodes of The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon air Sundays on AMC and AMC+.

    "content": "Dear Jassi arrives with echoes of Madonna\u2019s 1989 hit \u201cDear Jessie\u201d and its sugary promise of pink elephants and lemonade, but none of that turns out to be forthcoming in Tarsem Singh Dhandwar\u2019s beautiful and brutal sixth feature. Instead, we have perhaps the most disturbing bait-and-switch since George Sluizer\u2019s original iteration of The Vanishing , a Punjabi Juliet-meets-Romeo story that\u2019s much harsher that any so-far-filmed version of West Side Story and a whole lot funnier. This dissonance takes a while to reveal itself, but when it does, the shock is visceral. The fact that almost everything is true is the killer blow, and the shockwave of that reverberates through the poignant final credits, a static shot that forces the audience, or maybe just simply dares them, to think about what they\u2019ve just seen. Related Stories Breaking News Greta Gerwig On \"Incredible\" Success Of 'Barbie,' Why She Will Never Act In Her Own Films & The \"Nightmare\" Of Scripting Her Next Project -- London Film Festival Breaking News Academy CEO Bill Kramer: \"Theatres And Streamers Need To Coexist\" -- London Film Festival Immigrant stories have been big in 2023, but the troubling core of Dear Jassi is actually an emigrant story, one that directly deals with the lesser-publicized socio-economic downside of migration. This isn\u2019t some highfalutin academic exercise but a refreshing reflection of some of the realities, like the way people can leave their homelands and then, when safely in pastures greener, start to look down on the world they left behind. Lensed by regular collaborator Brendan Galvin, Dear Jassi is that rare culture-clash film that emphasizes similarities rather than the differences, to the extent that the presence of a cow is the best way to check you\u2019re definitely in India. The beginning is weirdly low-key for Singh, who made a splash with his 2000 debut The Cell , a serial-killer movie starring Jennifer Lopez as a shrink who can enter coma patients\u2019 minds that \u2014 can you believe it? \u2014 was accused of being a bit far-fetched. In an anonymous field, a singer-slash-musician uses the words of 18 th -century Sufi poet Bulleh Shah to set the scene. \u201cThey say love makes people crazy,\u201d he says, before the camera unexpectedly swipes right to a seemingly innocuous farm building. Love does, of course, do this, but the people made crazy in this story are not the lovers but those around them, and what happens over the next two hours is both a subtle and effective elaboration on Shakespeare\u2019s tale of two households and something that will later lead us back to that farm building and reveal it in a macabre new light. In this case, the two households span two continents. Sometime in the mid-90s, Canadian Indian girl Jassi (Pavia Sidhu) is visiting her cousin Charni in rural India when she lays eyes on Mithu (Yugam Sood), a village boy who excels at kabaddi, a rowdy local contact sport. For reasons that are never quite clear, Jassi becomes obsessed with Mithu, an obsession that raises red flags from the beginning. Equally unclear is the chronology; initially, Singh plays to and fro with time, showing Jassi at her home in Canada, where the police have been called to escort her from the family home. Tensions are running high. A woman\u2019s voice shouts, \u201cBitch, you\u2019re dead!\u201d How did we get here? Singh\u2019s film fills in that backstory with warmth and humor as Jassi and Mithu pursue a very chaste courtship; Jassi goes home and does everything she can to get Mithu over to Canada. Mithu, of course, has no clue how to get there. He has no passport, and even when he gets one, his attempt to book a flight is thwarted when a rip-off travel agent steals his fee (whenever we\u2019re in India, allusions to corruption and bribery are never far away). Nevertheless, Jassi persists, much to the dismay of her snobbish ex-pat mother, whose husband is gravely ill and whose determination to hold on to her sense of family, class and reputation turns out to be way scarier than any of the \u2014 mostly offscreen \u2014 physical violence, most of which ensues when Jassi demonstrates her love for Mithu (\u201cIf I\u2019d known you were going to do this,\u201d says her mother later, \u201cI would have killed you at birth\u201d). It\u2019s a bold melange, and if this film had emerged in the \u201970s, chances are that Dear Jassi would have test-screened once or twice and then been hurriedly edited down to a weird 80 minutes based on the jokey stuff, like Italian director Fernando Di Leo\u2019s controversial 1978 curio To Be Twenty . Happily, that\u2019s unlikely to happen here, especially with a director who likes to take literal ownership of his films. But even though the likes of Michael Haneke and Gaspar No\u00e9 have done some of the legwork in this area, Singh\u2019s film is still challenging, since it comes with a lightness that\u2019s not much known in the cinema of transgression \u2013 there are lots of laughs until, with nigh on 45 minutes still to go, the film radically changes gear and then, most disturbing of all, doubles back on itself with a seriously upsetting reveal. Admirers of Singh\u2019s 2006 delirious cult classic The Fall might be, at least initially, thrown by the relative ordinariness of Dear Jassi (and, compared to The Fall , almost anything seems ordinary). But like that film, Dear Jassi is working on a meta level, subverting a classic storyline \u2014 in that case, it was a hero\u2019s journey; in this case, it\u2019s two illicit lovers\u2019 flight \u2014 to create a powerful and provocative film about family, pride and tribalism. You may yawn and point out that Shakespeare said pretty much all that in the 16 th century, but the fact that the events referenced here happened less than 30 years ago is a sobering reminder of how Romeo and Juliet \u2018s senseless loss of lives has been fetishized into a romantic trope, and that a so-called \u201ctragic\u201d love affair comes with so much more collateral damage than we may ever know.",

    "description": "EA Sports UFC 5's updates presentation means important changes for visuals, lighting, and more.",
    "content": "It's been over three years since Electronic Arts released a new UFC game, but EA Sports UFC 5 is finally coming to current-gen consoles on October 27. The upcoming fighter marks an important milestone for EA Sports because, for the first time in franchise history, UFC 5 will hit store shelves with an M rating . This is significant because most sports games come in as a T or lower, but EA Sports has decided to embrace realistic violence in UFC 5 , earning that M rating with blood and brutality. Recently, EA Sports dropped a brand-new trailer that shows off some of the new presentation tweaks the team is making to really make the in-ring action pop. EA Sports UFC 5 Presentation Deep Dive Trailer The elements you'll see, hear & feel in the Octagon \u203c\ufe0f \ud83c\udfa5 @imuhboxer #UFC5 Presentation Deep Dive Pre-order today \u27a1\ufe0f https://t.co/9g8AVCC4E5 pic.twitter.com/Gl1tXYQCmY \u2014 EA SPORTS UFC (@EASPORTSUFC) October 7, 2023 One of the first things the team showed off is how they're using new dynamic lighting during the walkout to make the fighters stand out when they're entering the Octagon. The devs say that it will \"be hard to tell the difference\" between in-game walkouts and their real-life counterparts. Once things get into the ring, UFC 5 has new \"strand-based hair\" in addition to the previously mentioned lighting that should make the fighters look more true to life. The footage also gave us a better look at knockouts. Obviously, it's been a few years since we've seen a new UFC game, but the body physics looks even more ragdoll than in the past. In some ways, that's a good thing, but there are at least a few shots in the trailer that don't look very natural. The KO'd fighter's arms are waving around like noodles in a way that just doesn't happen in the real world. As has been discussed before, the team's new blood and sweat tech lets the team accurately splatter blood across the canvas throughout the fight. You'll see blood slowly accumulate on the mat throughout the fight, with it pooling under any fighter that's opened up with a big cut. It's safe to say that EA is going to earn that M rating with how true-to-life this part of the game is. With how dynamic the blood pooling is, you'll be able to see the story of the match on the mat as soon as the fight is over. The team also spent quite of time talking about the steps it has taken to ensure that strikes feel impactful and the changes it's made to improve character models. One of the more interesting things is the Shapeshifter feature that helps shape fighters' bodies to give them a diverse look and feel. They've also done quite a bit of work with in-game cinematics to get all of these new features into things like walk-outs and celebrations to make everything look even more authentic.

    "description": "John Dutton's enemies start to team up in Season 1 Episode 6's \"The Remembering\"",
    "content": "Yellowstone is back tonight on CBS , but things are a little different this time around. Up to now the network has been broadcasting two episodes each Sunday tonight, but tonight we only get one: Season 1, Episode 6 \"The Remembering\" . When we left off, Kayce had been arrested by the reservation police and while he's out now, things still aren't over for the youngest Dutton. This week, the fallout of Kayce's actions continue to be a source of stress, but it isn't the only one. Dan Jenkins is looking to bring John Dutton down and is making moves in that direction. Here's everything that went down. Fair warning: spoilers for Yellowstone beyond this point. Only read on if you really want to know! What Happened in \"The Remembering\"? Kayce rides the horse he gave John out into the forest, later stopping at a stream for a drink. The horse gets spooked and runs as a giant bear has shown up and about to attack. Kayce thinks he's going to die, but before the bear can actually attack him, a gunshot rings out and the bear runs away. As it turns out, Rip followed Kayce and saved his life but instead of a thank you, Kayce fights Rip, though Kayce doesn't exactly fare well. Rip tells him that he doesn't know what real work is and rides off. Back at the ranch, John spends time with Monica and Tate and Monica ends up asking John about the branding. John says that the brand is a way for the men who have been in trouble can signal that they are deserving of a second chance and Monica if that's behind Kayce's brand. She pushes John and he eventually tells her that John told Kayce not to marry her and force her to have an abortion when she was pregnant with Tate. When Kayce refused, John branded his son himself. Elsewhere, Rainwater is looking at land to buy. He wants land that specifically borders the Yellowstone and despite being told that what he's interested in has no power or access to water, he wants them all even though it will cost a lot of money to bring water there. Meanwhile, Jamie and Beth meet with Governor Perry to discuss their political plans and they want Jamie to run as an independent and that he'll run unopposed and be the swing vote. The governor has a one-on-one with Beth, who ends up threatening the governor if she ever sleeps with John again. The governor then meets with Jamie and asks about John's cancer, which Jamie didn't know about. Out in the fields, Kayce catches up with Rip, who reminds Kayce that he left and that he should stick with it. He also tells Kayce that he's tired of burying his secrets. Rip leaves and leaves behind a folder. It has the autopsy report about Robert. Later, Monica and Tate head to school (with Tate saying he wants to move to the ranch) and when they arrive the see a fight. Monica tries to break it up but is punched in the head and injured. Kayce gets to the school and he's advised to watch Monica for any signs her condition is getting worse. At the ranch, Beth and Jamie confront John about his cancer. Elsewhere, Dan Jenkins meets with a contact who he believes can help him deal with John Dutton and they conspire to find someone to run for Livestock Commissioner against him but they need someone else to be the face. A nearby Rainwater hears this and joins the conversation and offers himself up and offers Dan a power source for his subdivision in exchange for a $60 million loan he wants to use to build a casino using Dan's land. They come to an agreement. At home, Kayce notices a drone flying over so he takes it down and then spots a car in the distance. When he chases and catches up with the driver, the other car takes off. Monica goes outside but soon collapses and Kayce starts doing CPR. Yellowstone airs Sunday nights on CBS . The first four seasons of the series are also available to stream on Peacock. 0 comments Related: Yellowstone Episode 4 Brings in Massive Ratings for CBS Yellowstone: What is The Train Station?

    "description": "The scale and sophisticated tactics employed by Hamas in its attack on Israel indicate Iran likely played a significant role in the multi-pronged assault, former U.S. intelligence and military officers say.",
    "content": "The unprecedented scale and the sophisticated tactics Hamas used in its attack on Israel indicate Iran most likely played a significant role in the multipronged assault, former U.S. intelligence and military officers say. From the use of fast boats to hostage-taking to swarming an adversary, the Hamas operation displayed an approach Iran and its proxies often use against opponents with superior conventional forces, said three former senior intelligence officials and a former senior military officer. \u201cThe sophistication and the complexity of the attack seems beyond what Hamas could do on its own,\u201d a former senior U.S. intelligence official said. But in an interview, Ali Baraka, a senior Hamas official, denied that Iran supported or sanctioned the operation. \u201cIt was a surprise to everyone, including Iran,\u201d said Baraka, the head of Hamas\u2019 National Relations Abroad. Baraka, speaking in Beirut, noted that Iran supports Hamas, but he insisted that \u201cwe did not inform them that there was an operation that would happen at dawn on Oct. 7.\u201d He added, \u201cAfter the operation began, we informed Iran.\u201d The Wall Street Journal reported Sunday that Iranian security officials helped Hamas plan the surprise attack and approved it at a meeting in Beirut last Monday, according to senior members of Hamas and Hezbollah. The Journal reported that officers in Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps had worked with Hamas since August to devise the sophisticated air, land and sea assault. Two U.S. officials told NBC News that they don\u2019t have information to corroborate the Journal account. A senior Israeli diplomatic source said Israel isn\u2019t concerned about a direct war with Iran. \u201cIran\u2019s strategy is that of proxy war and to deny a direct connection to Hamas\u2019 efforts,\u201d the source said. \u201cThey work through proxies, and that\u2019s why they are the No. 1 state sponsor of terror.\u201d Iran\u2019s U.N. mission didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment. Iran\u2019s government has praised the Hamas attack. Marc Polymeropoulos, a former CIA officer who specialized in counterterrorism, the Middle East and South Asia, said on X that it will be critical for intelligence agencies to determine the precise role Iran played in the surprise assault. \"The difference between 'directing' the attack and giving the actual green light\" versus \"'coordinating' may be difference between war with Iran or not,\" he said. For decades, Iran has tried to counter technologically superior adversaries through guerrilla or low-tech methods, swarming warships with smaller speed boats, firing barrages of rockets, using drones and missiles to undercut opposing air forces and abducting foreign nationals, U.S. officials and analysts say. When one of Iran\u2019s proxies, whether they are Shiite militias in Iraq, Houthi forces in Yemen or Hamas in Gaza, demonstrate a significant advance in military sophistication, it is usually a sign that Tehran has lent a helping hand, said Michael Knights of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. \u201cThis was the case with the Houthi takeover of Yemen and with the Lebanese Hezbollah defense against Israel in 2006,\u201d Knights said. Striking Israel simultaneously at a variety of locations with rockets, small guerrilla cells, kidnapping units and fast boats \u201creeks of Iranian training, weapons provision, probably Iranian intelligence,\u201c said Colin Clarke, a senior researcher at the Soufan Center, a nonprofit organization that focuses on global security. \u201cThis was a full-on assault from multiple entry points. I have to believe the Iranians are playing a role,\u201d he said. A central question is how Hamas members were able to breach Israel\u2019s fortified border with Gaza, which consists of a series of fences, security posts, regular patrols, sophisticated cameras and ground motion sensors. That Hamas militants were able to cross over with relative ease at multiple points on the border raises the possibility that the militants may have jammed the cameras and electronic sensors, depriving the Israelis of an early warning as the attack began, said Mark Montgomery, a retired U.S. Navy rear admiral who recently visited the border area. Some of the security sensors may have been \u201ccompromised very early,\u201d Montgomery said in an interview, and that would have \u201callowed forces to push through before there was an adequate response.\u201d",

    "content": "FTR may have dropped their tag team titles on Saturday's new episode of AEW Collision , but that doesn't mean the beloved pro wrestling duo is leaving the company. Dax Harwood and Cash Wheeler, known as the tag team FTR, are one of the best wrestling duos in the world and have been enjoying a lengthy run as AEW World Tag Team Champions. That run came to an abrupt and surprising end on Saturday, as FTR lost to the newly formed team of Ricky Starks and Big Bill. After the loss, Harwood took to social media to celebrate the title run he and Wheeler enjoyed. Harwood posted a collection of photos on X (formerly Twitter) from FTR's recent title run, one of which included his good friend CM Punk. \"What a run. Love you all. Top Guys Out,\" Harwood wrote in the caption. With the inclusion of Punk, who is no longer employed by AEW , and his signature \"Top Guys Out\" message, some fans immediately wondered whether this meant FTR dropped the titles because they were leaving the company. Fortunately, that isn't the reality of the situation. What a run. Love you all. Top Guys Out. pic.twitter.com/GTUOjyYNZL \u2014 Uncle Dax FTR (@DaxFTR) October 8, 2023 Enough people commented to ask about an FTR exit that Harwood made another post to clarify what he meant. He confirmed that his \"Top Guys Out\" comment was simply in reference to the catchphrase he utters on TV all the time, and that FTR isn't going anywhere. \"We ain't going nowhere,\" Harwood wrote, making sure there could be no debate about his words. \"This is our home.\" Guys, I say \u2018Top Guys Out\u2019 all the time. We ain\u2019t going nowhere. This is our home. \u2014 Uncle Dax FTR (@DaxFTR) October 8, 2023 At the start of the year, FTR spent some time away from AEW TV, saying at the time that they were going to decide what was next for their careers. The decision they ultimately came to was to stick with AEW for the foreseeable future. The tag team revealed in April that they had signed contracts with AEW that would keep them with the company through roughly 2027 . It will likely be a long time before we see a version of AEW without Harwood and Wheeler involved. FTR's recent run as World Tag Team Champions began in April when the dup returned for a rematch against Austin and Colten Gunn. The Gunns agreed to give FTR a rematch for the tag titles when both members of FTR put their careers on the line. According to the stipulation, they would retire from AEW if they lost the match to the Gunns. They won the match and carried the titles until this past Saturday night. 0 comments Related: CM Punk Hints at WWE Return With a Key Marvel Reference AEW Star Flashes CM Punk Sign During Collision Major Update on Adam Cole's Injury and AEW Status",

    "content": "The 49ers went into their trick bag for the second touchdown of Sunday night\u2019s big showdown with the Cowboys, and the score involved two of their multi-talented stars showing off their ball skills. After a nice punt return by Ray-Ray McCloud, the 49ers had a short field to go, leading 7-0 early in the second quarter. On the first play of the drive from the Dallas 38-yard line, Brock Purdy handed the ball off to Christian McCaffrey, who ran right and pitched it to Deebo Samuel. Then Samuel quickly pitched it to a right-rolling Purdy to complete the flea-flicker. Purdy, with plenty of protection from the offensive linemen who had rolled right along with him, hit tight end George Kittle down the right sideline at the 20-yard line, and Kittle did the rest. Kittle sold a block before breaking downfield and past the Cowboys\u2019 defense. Jourdan Lewis rushed to catch up to Kittle for an unsuccessful attempt to punch the ball out of the tight end\u2019s arms. The score was Kittle\u2019s second of the game after he entered the game with no touchdowns through the 49ers\u2019 first four games (all wins). His first touchdown was a 19-yard catch on a deep cross on the 49ers\u2019 first drive of the game.",

    "content": "In case you've missed it, we have written of articles about every single reason why Cape May is just so great. Honestly, you would think the rest of the state is just pure trash compared to the precious gem that Cape May is. See what I mean??? Seriously, how can town be just so freaking fantastic??? Cape May has been dubbed the top beach in the state and one of the top beaches in the country, but is it really? Well according to Google Reviews and Yelp, it sure is up there. I guess you can't argue with the internet, so okay okay, Cape May beaches are pretty great... However, what about Manasquan? How about Island Beach State Park? Are we forgetting Lavalette? Cape May is pretty great, but let's not forget about the other great New Jersey beaches. This one I can't deny, I may agree slightly. I've done the Christmas house tour in the past and it really was so much fun and the houses were so pretty. Also, the decorated Washington Street Mall with all the lights is so precious. You know what other New Jersey town has a fantastic Christmas house tour? Point Pleasant Beach!! The PTO for the local elementary school hosts a Cook's Tour where local restaurants serve small dishes in beautifully decorated homes around town. I participated a few years ago, it's a blast! Moving right along here... I didn't know that Cape May hosts a Harvest Brew Festival that appears to be very popular. The festival takes place on the Physick Estate property, which I can't deny is very nice and Cape May does have a bunch of great breweries... Do you know what other really pretty NJ spot has a beer festival in the fall? Smithville. Plus, there are two Tomasello Winery tasting rooms...bonus! If you're looking for other fall beer festivals, . There is nothing I can sarcastically say about the zoo to fake argue this point. The Cape May County Zoo has cheetahs and cheetahs happen to be my favorite animal, so my bias comes in strong here. With that being said I also cannot recommend enough a trip to the Popcorn Park Zoo. I spent many childhood summer days visiting the zoo with my parents, grandparents, and siblings, so again I'm biased with fond childhood memories. So sure, Cape May is pretty great, but let us not forget that New Jersey is riddled with so many shore towns that deserve some recognition too from time to time.

    "content": "It\u2019s infuriating the Broncos don\u2019t know how to win, but what\u2019s far worse is how a once-proud NFL franchise doesn\u2019t even know how to act in defeat. While bad football happens, a team with bad football character starts at the top, and coach Sean Payton is responsible for losers in the Denver locker room that duck and run when the going gets tough. After a wretched , during which the Broncos forgot how to tackle and could not hold onto the football, much less the lead, Payton stood in account for only 4 minutes and 42 seconds during his postgame news conference before spinning on his heels and bolting from the podium. \u201cThank you, guys,\u201d Payton told media members, before ducking for cover, much the way a bully does when challenged. Sorry, Mr. Payton. But that doesn\u2019t cut it in Broncos Country, where losses can\u2019t be brushed off by a coach who came to Denver and immediately put everybody involved with the franchise on blast. Like everything that stinks, bad character rolls downhill. Captain Courtland Sutton, almost entirely ignored in the passing game of an offense that went backwards for much of a disastrous second half, said he would talk when finished dressing, then slipped out of the locker room without a peep. And captain Kareem Jackson, whose futile wave at Breece Hall was as close as any Denver defender came to touching the Jets running back on a 72-yard touchdown run that put New York ahead to stay in the third quarter, had to be prodded by a member of the Broncos public relations staff before reluctantly taking account for a unit that surrendered an average of 219 yards rushing over the course of the past four games. \u201cWe played a good first half and played like (crap) the second half,\u201d said Jackson, singing the sad chorus of a Denver team that has blown halftime leads in all three of its home losses to the Raiders, Commanders and Jets. Habitual collapse against weak NFL opposition is the definition of bad coaching. The CU Buffs have Coach Prime. Are the Broncos stuck with Coach Past His Prime? The fire in the Jets\u2019 eyes during this victory, which dropped the Broncos\u2019 to 1-4 and will mean high anxiety for Denver players until the NFL trade deadline on Oct. 31, was fueled by the loud mouth of Patyon. Prior to kickoff, tight end C.J. Uzomah gathered his New York teammates in the end zone of Empower Field, cursing Payton for making this game \u201cpersonal\u201d by taking a dig at the Jets and blasting former Broncos coach Nathaniel Hackett for \u201cone of the worst coaching jobs in the history of the NFL.\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s win this (bleep) for Hackett,\u201d bellowed Uzomah, screaming support for Hackett, now offensive coordinator for the Jets. After quarterback Russell Wilson fumbled with the Broncos driving for the tying field goal late in the fourth quarter, and New York cornerback Bryce Hall scooped up the turnover and returned it 39 yards for a game-clinching touchdown, the Jets playfully doused Hackett with cups of water on the visitors sideline, then wrapped him in hugs. The Jets rolled into our dusty old cowtown, itching for a fight and seeking vengeance. \u201cI don\u2019t think it made a difference. That was offseason talk,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cAt the end of the day, regardless of what was said, you can say whatever, we\u2019ve still got to go out and play.\u201d Payton upped the ante by making it personal, and when the Jets called his bluff, the Broncos folded, coughing up the 13-8 lead they took into halftime. During his brief, regrettable tenure on the Denver sideline, we all saw that Hackett couldn\u2019t manage the clock or his nerves. But at least he took the heat, and even in the worst times, treated people with respect. At age 59, Payton is too old to act like a spoiled brat. \u201cI have to do a better job,\u201d Payton said. \u201cIt starts with me.\u201d This is the coach who told us he would be ticked off if the Broncos didn\u2019t make the playoffs. But Payton is also the coach who couldn\u2019t figure out how to beat quarterbacks Jimmy Garoppolo, Sam Howell or Zach Wilson on Denver\u2019s home field. \u201cWe really should and could be 4-1,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cBut coulda-shoulda-woulda is not good enough.\u201d So where does the blame rest? Bad football and bad character festers from the top. By his own definition, the work of Payton has stunk worse than one of the worst coaching jobs in NFL history.",

    "content": "Jacksonville Sheriff T.K. Waters , arguing the brutal beating was justified. However, Woods\u2019 family is demanding a probe from the DOJ into what they see as another injustice. the Jacksonville Sheriff\u2019s Office took the 24-year-old into custody on various drug charges Friday. The police report says the JSO\u2019s Gang Unit followed a gray Dodge Durango to a gas station where a man wearing all black with a hood pulled over his head exited the car. The officer later identified the man as Woods and The report says the surveilling officer saw Woods get into the backseat of the car, pull out money and start counting it. The car then pulled off but the officer noted the driver wasn\u2019t wearing a seatbelt and called for backup to follow the truck. After cornering the vehicle in a dead end, Detectives Beau P. Daingle, Josue Garriga, T. McCullough and Hunter Sullivan The body camera footage showed what happened leading up to the bystander\u2019s video taken . \u201cThere was force used by detectives, and yes, that force is ugly. But the reality is that all force, all violence is ugly. And just because force is ugly does not mean it is unlawful or contrary to policy,\u201d Waters said in a press conference. Read a description of the body cam footage from : suffering punches and \u201cunintentional\u201d knee strikes to the face as well as elbows to the eye and punches to the ribs, the police report said. In the video, . After all of those swings, they eventually got Woods\u2019 arms behind his back and into handcuffs. However, t wasn\u2019t included in the footage shown at the press conference. Now, Woods\u2019 family are questioning the officers\u2019 use of force and the level of \u201ctransparency\u201d demonstrated by the department. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to preach transparency, practice transparency, full transparency. By them only playing a part of the body cam video, it causes more questions. It raises more questions than what it answers,\u201d said Porter. The attorneys said since Woods was transferred to jail, his face is still swollen limiting his eyesight and he\u2019s been suffering dizzy spells and pain from a ruptured kidney with nothing but ibuprofen and Vaseline to treat it.",

    "content": "Celebrities are just like us. They want to be the best parents to their children, they often doubt themselves, and they look for parenting advice on Instagram. In a recent interview for the of Kindred by PARENTS, GRAMMY award-winning singer and actress Kelly Rowland opens up about how she\u2019s trying to break generational curses and take a new approach to parenting while raising sons Titan, 8, and Noah, 2, whom she shares with husband Tim Weatherspoon. Raised by a single mom who nannied to make ends meet, Rowland\u2019s relationship with her father was icy for a big chunk of her life \u2013 she even kept him away from her Destiny\u2019s Child shows when she was a teenager. The two before reconnecting after the birth of her oldest son, Titan and the death of her mother, Doris Rowland Garrison, in 2014. But when she finally sat down and listened to his side of the story, Rowland said she couldn\u2019t help but give her father a little grace for his shortcomings. \u201cHe\u2019s telling me about his dynamic with his father, and his father\u2019s father, and it\u2019s non-existent, too,\u201d in a 2022 interview. \u201cSo how can one learn how to be something when they weren\u2019t taught?\u201d As Rowland tries to do things differently with her sons, she says she and her family depend on the support of an amazing village that includes her in laws and her Destiny\u2019s Child \u201csisters.\u201d But she adds that she gets a lot of advice from therapy and Instagram. The \u201cDilemma\u201d singer says her parenting sweet spot is a blend of which suggests people can achieve anything with hard work and dedication and the late rapper in his kids \u2013 teaching that integrity is doing the right thing when no one is looking. And she hopes the result is putting confident Black men into the world. \u201cI just want to get this right. I want to really be a part of bringing some really amazing young man forth into the world. That was my only prayer,\u201d . \u201cMy only prayer was to have really great young Black men in this world who were sure of themselves and didn\u2019t have to be told who they were. I really cared about that because the narrative is tough as it is.\u201d And while parenting is one job that doesn\u2019t come with a set of instructions, Rowland said she\u2019s trying not to be so hard on herself. \u201cI hate to mess up. But I\u2019m literally giving myself grace,\u201d . \u201cI\u2019m learning that maybe all of the decisions that my mom made were not the greatest decisions. And I\u2019m trying to change that this generation.\u201d",

    "content": "During his interview at the 74th International Astronautical Congress, Elon Musk discussed the possibility of life outside of Earth and whether he has encountered such evidence during his space fairing ventures. The CEO of SpaceX was awarded the World Space Award and appeared at the event via video link to discuss some of the developmental changes of Starship, the world's largest and most powerful rocket that has ever taken flight. Musk explained that the design behind Starship is purposeful, with the primary objective of providing a reusable transportation method to set up colonies of humans on the surface of the Moon, and ultimately Mars. Additionally, Musk touched on the hot-button topic of aliens, beginning the conversation with, \" People often ask me if I'm seeing any evidence of aliens - and I unfortunately have seen no evidence of aliens yet. \" Musk jokingly added, \" We are the aliens \". This take on Musk is nothing unusual as the SpaceX CEO has long pointed out the lack of substantial evidence for extra-terrestrial life. This sentiment plays into Musk's reasoning for wanting to get humans to Mars, as the SpaceX CEO believes if we are alone, we bear the heavy burden of making sure the light of consciousness doesn't go out, which means making humanity a multi-planetary species in precaution of Earth suddenly becoming a home that is no longer viable.",

    "content": "Astrophysicists are on the brink of seeing the universe right before the Big Bang, and it's all thanks to NASA's immensely powerful James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Herbig-Haro 46/47 captured by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Astrophysicist Richard Ellis from the University College London spoke at New Scientists Live , where he explained the raw power of the Webb telescope and how close astrophysicists are from seeing the very first stars and galaxies forming - a feat that is currently breaking the standard model of the nature of the universe, including its evolution. The preliminary results from Webb's observations of the early universe reveal there are fewer and brighter galaxies than the Lambda cold dark matter model states possible. Webb is capable of looking further back in time than any other space telescope, and according to Ellis, Webb can see as far back as just 400 million years after the occurrence of the Big Bang. Researchers attempting to explain this newly found data suggest one of two theories, or a combination of either. The first is that stars in the early universe were much more massive than what is observable today, resulting in more light, or early galaxies produce stars much faster than researchers expect. Whatever is the conclusive explanation will alter the standard cosmological model of the universe.",

    "description": "What are the overreactions for the Sunday afternoon slate of games?",
    "content": "Week 5 of the season was filled with excitement across the board. The Pittsburgh Steelers had a thrilling victory over the Baltimore Ravens and Jacksonville Jaguars stunned the Buffalo Bills, while the Miami Dolphins continued their offensive blitzkrieg on the league. Oh, and the San Francisco 49ers crushed the Dallas Cowboys. Ja'Marr Chase and shined while and flashed again. Joe Burrow finally looked like Joe Burrow as well. As the Sunday games wrapped up in Week 5, there were plenty of overreactions to go around. Which are overreactions and which are reality? Reality The same script persists. The Cowboys blew out bad football teams like the Giants and Patriots and lost to a team they shouldn't in the Cardinals through their first four games of the season. The 49ers were the real test to prove how good Dallas was among the NFC hierarchy. Instead, the Cowboys put up a complete dud. Dak Prescott threw three interceptions against a 49ers defense that has his number (has 21 in his last 19 games played including postseason) and the defense allowed 42 points, having no answer for Brock Purdy (four touchdowns). The Cowboys defense dominated Daniel Jones, Zach Wilson and Mac Jones (Josh Dobbs was the other quarterback they faced in that stretch). Facing Purdy, they allowed four touchdowns and a 142.0 passer rating. The combined record of the first four opponents Dallas faced was 5-15, outscoring opponents 124-41. The 49ers were 5-0 and the Cowboys were outscored 42-10. They allowed more points to the 49ers than they did the previous four games. Of course, the Cowboys won't be ultimately judged until January. Through five games, the Cowboys are still paper tigers. Reality Belichick should be embarrassed over what thePpatriots have become. After Sunday's 34-0 loss to the , the Patriots have been outscored 72-3 over the last two games. New England has just 55 points on the season -- or the have scored more in one game (70) than the Patriots have all year. The Patriots were dealt back-to-back 30-point losses for first time since 1970 and Belichick has suffered the two worst losses of his career in consecutive weeks. In his first 453 games as a head coach, Belichick lost by 30 points one time -- he's lost by 30-plus points in his last two games. New England is injured on defense and horrible on offense, benching in consecutive games. The Patriots should do the right thing and thank Belichick for his tremendous career with the organization after the year. Maybe Belichick needs a fresh start somewhere else. Or perhaps the game has passed Belichick by. Reality The Dolphins are just making history by the week at this point. Take a look at what Miami has accomplished: The Dolphins lead the NFL in passing yards (1,639), yards per attempt (10.0), rushing yards (929) and yards per rush (6.9) this season. They lead the NFL in yards per game (511.0), yards per play (8.02), firts downs per game (25.5), and points per game (37.5). Miami just leads the league in every major offensive category with an incredibly balanced attack. The 2000 Rams (the historic start for those 1999-2001 \"Greatest Show on Turf\" teams) did score more through five games (43.4 points per game), but the Dolphins beat them in yards per game (505.4) and clobber them on the ground. The 2000 Rams averaged 395.4 passing yards per game but only 110.8 rushing yards, while the Dolphins are at 327.8 passing yards and 185.8 rushing yards. Both offenses are record setting, but the Dolphins have the edge. Overreaction Burrow certainly has made a case that he is back, especially since this week was the first week all year he wasn't on the injured list. He threw for 316 yards and three touchdowns in the ' 34-20 win over the Cardinals, moving around in the pocket and completing a season-high 78.3% of his passes. While Burrow's numbers were good, he averaged just 5.9 yards per attempt. This was with going off for 15 catches for 192 yards and three touchdowns. This was an excellent step in the right direction for Burrow, needed against a rebuilding Cardinals team. The -- and getting back -- will be a good test for Burrow next week. Overreaction Games like Sunday are difficult to defend Jackson, especially after how two of his final three possessions went against the the late in the fourth quarter. If the goal line interception on third-and-goal up 10-8 wasn't bad enough, Jackson fumbled on the ' next offensive possession on the second play after the Steelers scored a touchdown to take the 14-10 lead ( forced the fumble and recovered). The Ravens ended up losing as Jackson had two turnovers in the fourth quarter. Doesn't mean Jackson isn't a clutch quarterback. He has a career 94.6 passer rating in the fourth quarter with 25 passing touchdowns and 12 interceptions -- while also having seven rushing touchdowns and 4.1 yards per carry. Jackson does have nine game-winning drives since becoming a starter in 2019 (but the Ravens have typically been ahead in fourth quarters under him since he's 42-17 as a starter. The numbers say Jackson can get the job done, even if he's 13th in the NFL out of 30 quarterbacks in passer rating in the fourth quarter and overtime since 2019 (minimum 300 attempts). Jackson is an enigma and Sunday added to that. Reality The answer to this is a resounding yes. After a 1-2 start, who would have thought being the first team to play consecutive weeks in London would be enough for the Jaguars to get their act together? Jacksonville never let up against a team that looked like they played in London for the first time, rushing for 196 yards against a Bills defense that allowed just 100.7 yards on the ground to that point. The defense also held Buffalo to just 20 points, this after the Bills averaged 41 points per game the previous three weeks. Buffalo was the hottest team in the NFL heading into this game and never led. This may have been Doug Pederson's signature win with the Jaguars, as the Jacksonville defense has held the Bills and to 20-or-less points in their matchups. Both were believed to be two of the best three teams in the AFC heading into the year. The Jaguars have entered that conversation. With the , new Orleans Saints, and Pittsburgh Steelers coming up before the bye week, the Jaguars have a golden opportunity to solidify that contender status by getting off to a 6-2 start. Overreaction The Colts just paid Taylor and made him the highest-paid running back in football. That isn't going to happen. However, Moss brought the discussion up after finishing with 23 carries for 165 yards and two touchdowns (7.2 yards per carry) in Indianapolis' 23-16 win over Tennessee. Moss finished with 195 yards of offense and had 26 touches to Taylor's 7. The Colts obviously rode the hot hand, but Moss is one of the best running backs in the NFL through five games. Moss is third in the NFL in rushing yards (445) and is one of 12 players to average 5.0 yards per carry or higher (5.0). He's also tied for ninth in rushing touchdowns (3). The Colts are paying Moss $1.1 million to be this productive. Perhaps Moss won't start, but his production through five games may have caused Indianapolis to overthink paying Taylor. Reality What Carter has done through five games for the has been special. Carter was a game changer for the Eagles defense in Sunday's win over the Rams, finishing with two sacks, three pressures, and two quarterback hits. Carter is the third Eagles player to have 3.5-plus sacks in their first five career games, joining Corey Simon (4.0 in 2000) and Reggie White (4.5 in 1985). Carter is tied for seventh in the NFL in pressures (23), leading all defensive tackles. His pressure rate of 17.8% is also seventh in the NFL (minimum 100 pass rushing snaps) and leads all NFL defensive tackles. He's also tied for third amongst all defensive tackles in sacks, trailing only and . Who knows where the Eagles defense would be without Carter, but his impact is felt every week. He's the best defensive rookie in football through five games.",

    "content": "The Department of Public Health and Social Services Southern Region Community Health Center at Inal\u00e5han will open at 6 p.m. tonight and will remain open through the duration of Tropical Storm Bolaven, a release from the Joint Information Center stated. \"DPHSS reminds the community that if you are experiencing a life-threatening condition to please contact 911,\" the release added. Pre-operational inspection appointments that were scheduled for Monday with the Division of Environmental Health at DPHSS were cancelled, and applicants will be contacted by the division to reschedule when operations resume normally, according to the JIC. \"For clearances for business licenses and permits, the Business License and Permit Center (BLPC) is currently closed. DEH will resume the processing of clearances once BLPC reopens,\" the JIC release stated. \"Once BLPC resumes normal operations, a DEH representative will be available on Fridays from 8 a.m. to 12 p.m. and 1 p.m. to 4 p.m. for accepting new sanitary permit applications and for the processing of clearances,\" the release added. In addition to updates for DPHSS, the JIC stated on behalf of the Guam Fire Department that patients requiring constant supplemental oxygen at home are urged to ensure that they have filled backup cylinders to last the duration of the storm. Those with powered units should also have an alternative source of oxygen available that does not require electricity, in case of power outages, the JIC release stated. Residents and visitors are also cautioned against engaging in any kind of water related activities during the storm's approach and passing. The public is advised to steer clear of the ocean as hazardous sea conditions are being whipped up by Bolaven. \"Residents and visitors are also advised against venturing along trails close to the water or shoreline, as high surf can knock a person down and sweep them off beaches and rocks. These waves can be deadly, even for the most experienced swimmers,\" the JIC release stated. \"Before and during the storm, rescue personnel may not be able to respond due to deteriorating weather conditions. Resources such as boats, jet skis, and aircraft normally involved in search and rescue operations may be secured when conditions become too dangerous,\" the release added.",

    "content": "A team of researchers has published a new study confirming the age of the oldest fossilized human footprints discovered in North America. The new study was published in the journal Science and details fossilized human footprints in White Sands National Park, New Mexico, which were originally discovered in 2021. These footprints have since undergone thorough dating through various methods, with each of the methods arriving at the same approximate figure of 21,500 years. Leading to the conclusion that humans were present during the Last Glacial Maximum that occurred around 20,000 years ago, during the last phase of the Pleistocene epoch. So, how are the scientists so sure about the age of the footprints? Scientists performed radiocarbon dating on the seeds of an aquatic plant named Ruppia cirrhosa, which was discovered embedded within the footprints. These results suggested the footprints were between 21,000 and 23,000 years old. Next, the team took 75,000 pollen grains, along with quartz, which is also within the fossilized footprint. Radiocarbon dating on the pollen put its age between 22,600 to 23,400 years ago. The quartz underwent a dating technique called Optically stimulated luminescence, which measures the last time the mineral was exposed to sunlight. The quartz testing put the age at around 21,500 years ago.",

    "description": "President Joe Biden ordered US ships and warplanes to move closer to Israel in a show of support on Sunday, while sending fresh military aid after attacks by the Palestinian militant group Hamas.",
    "content": "President Joe Biden ordered US ships and warplanes to move closer to Israel in a show of support on Sunday, while sending fresh military aid after attacks by the Palestinian militant group Hamas. The Pentagon said it was sending the aircraft carrier USS Gerald R. Ford and its accompanying warships to the eastern Mediterranean, while boosting fighter aircraft squadrons in the region. US Central Command confirmed Sunday afternoon that ships and planes had begun moving to their new posts. At least four American citizens are known to have been killed in the violence so far, according to Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer. The White House has moved quickly to affirm US backing for Israel after Saturday's surprise attack from the Gaza Strip, vowing \"rock solid\" support and warning other parties to stay out of the conflict. Biden on Sunday spoke to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and \"conveyed that additional assistance for the Israeli Defense Forces is now on its way to Israel with more to follow over the coming days,\" the White House said. \"The leaders also discussed ongoing efforts to ensure that no enemies of Israel believe they can or should seek advantage from the current situation,\" it said in a statement. The US president further \"pledged his full support for the Government and people of Israel in the face of an unprecedented and appalling assault by Hamas terrorists.\" Hamas later accused the United States, a major supplier of arms to Israel, of \"actual participation in the aggression against our people\" by moving the aircraft carrier. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict's worst escalation in decades has claimed more than 700 lives on the Israeli side, according to the military, while Gaza officials reported at least 400 deaths in Israeli air strikes. Netanyahu has steeled his shocked nation for what he called a long war ahead, with tens of thousands of Israeli forces already deployed to battle holdout Hamas forces and prepare a possible Gaza ground offensive. The conflict has stoked fears of a wider conflagration. Lebanon's Iran-backed Hezbollah movement said Sunday it had fired shells and missiles at Israeli positions. With tensions rising, US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said he was sending forces to \"bolster regional deterrence efforts\" after discussions with Biden. As well as the USS Gerald R. Ford carrier, this deployment includes a guided missile cruiser and four guided missile destroyers, Austin said in a statement. \"The United States government will be rapidly providing the Israel Defense Forces with additional equipment and resources, including munitions,\" added Austin, who also spoke with his Israeli counterpart on Sunday. The movement of US ships and planes and the aid to Israel \"underscores the United States' ironclad support for the Israel Defense Forces and the Israeli people.\" The United States on Sunday afternoon led calls for condemnation of the Hamas assault on Israel at the United Nations Security Council. \"I expect to hear from the other Council members very strong condemnation of these heinous acts of terrorism committed against the Israeli people and their government,\" senior US diplomat Robert Wood told reporters. A US National Security Council spokesperson had Sunday evening confirmed the deaths of a number of Americans, without giving any further details. But in a statement after a Senate briefing with senior national security and State Department officials, the Majority leader Schumer said: \"The Administration told us that they know of four thus far, but, sadly, we know the toll will rise. Earlier Sunday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Americans may also have been taken hostage in the attacks. He told ABC that \"this is a massive terrorist attack that is gunning down Israeli civilians in their towns, in their homes, and as we've seen so graphically, literally dragging people across the border with Gaza. \"So, you can imagine the impact this is having throughout Israel. And the world should be revolted at what it has seen.\" State and local authorities throughout the United States -- including in New York, Los Angeles, Miami and Houston -- said there would be increased security presence at US synagogues in the coming days, though there was no specific threat. dk/caw/des/sn/mtp",

[...] Read More... The post Bank of Canada identifies global barriers in developing inclusive CBDC appeared first on CoinGeek.",
    "content": "The Bank of Canada has highlighted several challenges standing in the way of banking regulators looking to launch a (CBDC) amid rapid digitization. In a staff discussion paper, the Bank of Canada that efforts to roll out CBDCs will be complicated by the desire to achieve inclusivity for all demographics. Global central banks often cited as a motivating factor for experimenting with retail CBDCs. To build a CBDC with a universal application, the paper stressed that central banks must achieve the trio of digital inclusion, accessibility, and financial inclusion. The Bank of Canada remarks that the three conditions are not mutually exclusive but work in synergy to ensure universal usage. The central bank poked holes into the inability of existing private payment forms to cater to financial inclusivity needs for a cross-section of individuals. Upon a closer survey of the inadequacies of the payment system, the analytical note surmised that many people have significant clogs in their access to global financial services. \u201cOur analysis suggests that the number of individuals who face barriers or exclusion is much larger than was previously assumed,\u201d read the report. While launching a CBDC may be the perfect answer, the Bank of Canada noted that it will not be smooth sailing for central banks. The report stated that central banks will have to grapple with the issue of trust over security and privacy concerns associated with . Furthermore, central banks will have to find a solution around the need for more financial literacy among users and \u201cdeeper research into design for cognitive accessibility.\u201d In Canada, for example, there are low levels of smartphone usage amongst older Canadians, and several studies have also indicated that Canadians with disabilities may face specific accessibility barriers when adopting CBDCs, noting that they are more likely to be without internet access. The Bank of Canada has already begun addressing potential pain points with CBDCS, with the institution already mulling over the possibilities of in the country. Although no clear blueprint has been laid forward, the central bank noted that the proposed functionality would allow users in remote locations to make without needing an internet connection. CBDCs will need help competing favorably with existing payment options in their payment ecosystems, according to the Bank of Canada. In August, the Canadian central bank stated that it sees locally, given the widespread access to diverse payment options available to the average resident. There are still lingering fears that a botched launch of a CBDC could affect commercial banks in jurisdictions with mass acceptance, adversely affecting their abilities to issue loans. Central banks are advised to collaborate with commercial banks and fintechs to solve the challenge from ideation to full-scale launch. Watch: Blockchain provides perfect foundation for CBDC",

    "content": "If you\u2019re looking to grab a gaming laptop, this Prime Day October 2023 is the perfect time, especially since Prime Day has traditionally been a great time to pick up new electronics. In fact, we\u2019re seeing a lot of great gaming laptop deals across the board, whether you want something budget-friendly or you want a beast of a gaming laptop that can run anything. To that end, we\u2019ve collected some of our favorite Prime Day deals on laptops across several retailers, so you don\u2019t have to do all the dirty work. So be sure to check out the deals below and come back regularly as we update this list with better deals. Contents MSI Bravo 15 with RX6500M \u2014 $700, was $900 HP Victus 15z with RTX 2050 \u2014 $700, was $950 Dell G16 with RTX 4050 Ti \u2014 $800, was $1,250 HP Victus 16z with RTX 4050 \u2014 $900, was $1,300 Alienware m16 with RTX 4060 \u2014 $1,350, was $1,750 HP OMEN Gaming Laptop 16 with RTX 4070 \u2014 $1,500, was $1,800 Razer Blade 15 with RTX 3070 Ti \u2014 $2,000, was $3,000 Alienware m18 with RTX 4070 \u2014 $2,200, was $2,500 Razer Blade 17 with RTX 3070 Ti \u2014 $2,300, was $,3400 Alienware m16 with RTX 4090 \u2014 $2,950, was $3,550 Alienware x16 with RTX 4090 \u2014 $3,100, was $3,800 Show 6 more items MSI Bravo 15 with RX6500M \u2014 $700, was $900 MSI If you\u2019re looking for a great entry-level gaming laptop , then this MSI Bravo 15 is a great choice. Under the hood, you\u2019ll find an AMD RX6500M, which is roughly equivalent to an RTX 3050 and will handle most modern games fine at lower graphical settings. It also comes with a Ryzen 7-5800H, which is a high-end process that should be able to handle more processor-hungry games, like simulation or strategy games. There\u2019s also a big positive with going all-AMD since its GPUs and CPUs are generally more power efficient than their Nvidia and Intel counterparts, so you get a bit better battery performance. HP Victus 15z with RTX 2050 \u2014 $700, was $950 HP While the AMD GPUs are great, some folks might want access to Nvidia\u2019s DLSS RTX and Ray-tracing technologies, and for that, they have to grab one of the RTX graphics cards. In the case of this HP Victus , you get an RTX 2050, which is weaker than the AMD RX6500M, but does give you access to RTX tech. Besides that, you get the mid-range AMD Ryzen 5 7535HS, which is still powerful enough to handle most games and productivity tasks you throw at it. It comes with 8GB of RAM, which is a bit on the low end, and 512 GB of storage, which isn\u2019t too bad for a budget-oriented gaming laptop. Related The best October Prime Day HP laptop deals happening today Best October Prime Day deals: Early offers you can shop today The best October Prime Day Alienware deals right now Dell G16 with RTX 4050 Ti \u2014 $800, was $1,250 Dell Dell\u2019s G16 gaming laptop is the usual recommendation when folks want to buy a budget gaming laptop, and for good reason. It has the slightly more powerful RTX 3050Ti, while the screen is a large 16-inch one with a resolution of 2560\u00d71600 and a refresh rate of 165Hz. It\u2019s rare that you find so many great features on a screen at this price point, and while the RTX 3050Ti would struggle to hit all of them, it gives you a lot of room to pick what you want to favor. You also get 16GB of DDR5 RAM , which is impressive, as well as 512GB of storage, which is a bit on the lower end with how big games are these days, but it\u2019s not a dealbreaker. HP Victus 16z with RTX 4050 \u2014 $900, was $1,300 HP Another good budget gaming laptop choice is the HP Victus 16z, which comes with an RTX 4050 and a larger screen than the Victus 15 variant. The RTX 4050 is still an entry-level card, but it will still fare better than an RTX 3050 or even an RTX 3050Ti; you get the more advanced DLSS 3.0 where it\u2019s available and will make a difference if you play those games. As for the processor, you get a similar mid-range AMD Ryzen 5 7640HS, a great CPU for most tasks you\u2019ll likely encounter. We also like to see the upgraded 16 GB of DDR5 RAM, although the storage remains the same at 512GB. Alienware m16 with RTX 4060 \u2014 $1,350, was $1,750 Alienware Moving up in the scale of GPUs, this Alienware m16 comes with an RTX 4060 , which will start letting you run games at medium settings and a relatively higher refresh rate at FHD. That said, the screen is quite impressive, sitting at 16 inches and with a resolution of 2560 x 1600 and a whopping 240Hz refresh rate, which we doubt the RTX 4060 will manage. Even so, it gives you a lot of room to prioritize resolution or refresh rate, which is perfect if you like both action-packed and more slow-paced but visually appealing games. Luckily, you do get a powerful AMD Ryzen 7 7745HX processor and 16GB of DDR5 RAM, so you\u2019re going to have an overall great day-to-day and gaming experience. HP OMEN Gaming Laptop 16 with RTX 4070 \u2014 $1,500, was $1,800 HP Moving up another step in GPU, the OMEN Laptop X16 is where we start seeing some real gaming power. It comes with an RTX 4070 , which is a card that can finally run games at 1440p and at or over 100hz refresh rate, and it will certainly be able to take advantage of the X16\u2019s display. Running at 2560 x 1440 resolution and an impressive 240Hz, the RTX 4070 will let you push each of these a little bit farther and is a good middle-ground gaming laptop if you don\u2019t want something budget or expensive. We also love to see that it comes with a larger 1TB SSD, the equally powerful Intel i7-13700HX, and 16GB of DDR5 RAM, making this an overall great gaming laptop for the price. Razer Blade 15 with RTX 3070 Ti \u2014 $2,000, was $3,000 . Razer is a company known for making thin and light gaming laptops and holds a similar position to Apple when it comes to gaming gear. That means you get great performance mixed in with a small frame, which is why we\u2019re impressed with the inclusion of the RTX 3070 Ti in this Razer Blade 15 . While it will struggle at 4k gaming, especially with higher resolution and refresh rate, it should easily handle the Blade 15\u2019s 240hz QHD monitor, although it might still struggle a little to play the most modern AAA games at the highest of each. Razer even throws in a great i7-12800H processor, 1TB of storage, and 16GB of DDR5 RAM. Alienware m18 with RTX 4070 \u2014 $2,200, was $2,500 Jacob Roach / Digital Trends If processing power is really important to you, potentially for editing tasks, this Alienware m18 comes with one of the most powerful CPUs on the market, the AMD Ryzen 9 7845HX. Besides that, you get a respectable RTX 4070, which you\u2019ll need to run the FHD screen that can hit an incredible 480Hz refresh rate. This is a laptop that\u2019s really targeted towards professional e-sports players, with the CPU great for streaming, and the 32GB of DDR5 RAM being excellent for running recording software. Razer Blade 17 with RTX 3070 Ti \u2014 $2,300, was $,3400 Razer If you like what the Razer Blade 15 has to offer but want a bigger screen, then the Razer Blade 17 is a good option. It has an excellent 17.3-inch 240 Hz QHD monitor powered by an RTX 3070 Ti, which might be a bit underpowered for that but will certainly give you a lot of space to optimize for your preferences. That said, you do get the high-end Intel i9-12900H which, along with the AMD Ryzen 9 CPUs, are some of the best processors on the market, so it\u2019s perfect for streaming content while gaming. You also get 16GB of DDR5 RAM and 1TB of storage, both of which are great. Alienware m16 with RTX 4090 \u2014 $2,950, was $3,550 Alienware Of course, if you want the most powerful GPU you can get in a laptop, or desktop for that matter, this configuration of the Alienware m16 comes with an RTX 4090 . In fact, it\u2019s a very similar laptop to the Alienware m18 in that it\u2019s targeted to professional e-sports players since it has only an FHD resolution but a whopping 480Hz refresh rate. That said, you can upgrade it to a QHD monitor that runs at 240Hz for an extra $100, and if you\u2019re not a pro streamer, that\u2019s definitely something you should go for. Besides that, you get an AMD Ryzen 9 7945HX, an impressive 32GB of DDR5 RAM, and a very good 2TB of storage. Alienware x16 with RTX 4090 \u2014 $3,100, was $3,800 Jacob Roach / Digital Trends / Digital Trends Alternatively, if you want something a bit more sleek looking with the highest specs you can get, this Alienware x16 doesn\u2019t play around, especially with an RTX 4090 and an Intel i9-13900HK, which is the most powerful CPU on this list.

    "content": "\u201cI see my role as a trusted adult,\u201d says Canadian sex educator Cory Silverberg . \u201cA lot of advice for parents skims over the fact that they are not good at stuff. We\u2019re bad at friendships. We are bad with money: we do an online shop at 1am, but we also know we need to make our kids financially literate. At the end of a long day, if my kid asks a question, I\u2019ll give them a short answer. That is why we need trusted adults.\u201d It\u2019s hard to think of an area that needs a trusted adult to update and rejig it more than sex education. And with a trio of books \u2013 What Makes A Baby , Sex is a Funny Word and You Know, Sex \u2013 illustrated with friendly faces and unintimidating bodies by artist Fiona Smyth, Silverberg may have done just that. The trilogy, according to the New York Times , has \u201cquietly upended the genre\u201d. The books are aimed at audiences from young children up to teens and educate children in calm, neutral terms, making room for diverse experiences \u2013 and for doubt. A good example is the definition of sex. In You Know, Sex \u2013 Silverberg\u2019s 2022 book aimed at teenagers \u2013 it\u2019s seen as \u201ca word people use to describe something they do to feel good in their bodies. People call this \u2018having sex\u2019. Having sex is something people can choose to do on their own or with other people.\u201d This is revolutionary for those of us raised on the likes of Claire Rayner \u2019s Body Book , where sex was \u201ca special grown-up way of loving someone very much. It is the most loving sort of cuddle there is for grown-ups.\u201d Most adults didn\u2019t have the opportunity to think and talk about sex and gender when they were younger Everything is reconsidered. So Silverberg says: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t ever say: \u2018An orgasm is a good thing.\u2019 For lots of people it is and for some people it isn\u2019t. Sometimes an orgasm gives someone a migraine, or makes someone cry.\u201d If the tone feels unusual, it\u2019s because the books\u2019 content is informed not only by Silverberg\u2019s knowledge but also by discussions with young people about their own questions and experience. It\u2019s from the perspective of many people of different races, classes, sexualities, genders, abilities and body shapes rather than from one grown-up eager to deal with the facts of life. In fact, many parents may learn something new. Cory Silverberg\u2019s 2013 picture book for preschoolers to kids aged 8. Photograph: Seven Stories Publishers In the touching introduction to You Know, Sex , Silverberg acknowledges this: \u201cThis book is for adults, too. Most adults didn\u2019t have the opportunity to think and talk about sex and gender when they were younger. There will be things in this book that are new for adults. If you know an adult who is open to reading this book with you, remind them that they may need time before they are ready to talk about what they learned here.\u201d I can hear that playful but pragmatic tone when I speak to Silverberg, such as, when talking about other books for children that feature queer experiences, they say: \u201cEven the well-meaning books are kind of shitty. There\u2019s a gay penguin book \u2013 what\u2019s it called? People love it. But it teaches kids that it\u2019s weird to be gay.\u201d Silverberg\u2019s own focus is realistic rather than idealistic. The books feel like graphic novels drawn in bold and friendly colours. They feature four children from different backgrounds, with a range of shapes and skin tones from pink to green. Definitely no penguins. \u201c[My books are] very much set in the world. Some educators say that you shouldn\u2019t talk about boys and girls \u2013 just gender . But that doesn\u2019t make any sense. I don\u2019t understand gender. You need to start with the world kids live in \u2013 which is one of boys and girls. But in the second book [ Sex is a Funny Word , which is aimed at eight years up] I do explain that there are boys and girls, and the rest of us.\u201d Silverberg\u2019s 2015 book is aimed at kids aged 8-10. Photograph: Seven Stories Publishers Silverberg identifies as non-binary and uses they/them pronouns. \u201cI use the word queer, which is mostly about my gender. I\u2019ve come to use the term non-binary, and that\u2019s pretty new for me, because I grew up when that wasn\u2019t an option.\u201d They are a parent to a child aged under 10, and they themselves were brought up in a liberal Toronto household in the 1970s by a children\u2019s librarian and a sex therapist. \u201cWhen I was a teen, all my friends thought it was so cool that I had a dad who was a sex therapist. I was allowed to be in my room alone or with friends. I knew what a condom was.\u201d When they were 17 and looking for a summer job, their dad found them one as a sales assistant at Lovecraft, the first sex-positive, female-friendly sex shop in Canada. They ended up working at Lovecraft for nine years while they attended college and got a masters of education at the University of Toronto. My books are trying to make a world I want to live in, but they always reflect the actual world Through their shop work, Silverberg discovered a special interest in helping disabled clientele, and when they finished studying they founded Come As You Are, a co-operative that offers workshops on pleasure and caters to the needs of disabled people. In 2003 they authored a book for adults, The Ultimate Guide to Sex and Disability . Then some friends asked Silverberg to write a book for children about how babies are made. The father of the couple was a trans man, but Silverberg realised they wanted to tell that story for all children \u2013 those born through reproductive technology such as IVF, donors and surrogates as well as through intercourse. After the book \u2013 What Makes a Baby \u2013 was rejected by a series of publishers, in 2015 Silverberg created a Kickstarter to self-publish. They were looking for $9,500 but instead raised $65,000 in 30 days, and the book went on to win a string of awards in the US. A lot of early supporters were LGBTQ+ families, but the desire to find new ways to talk about sex and relationships was stronger than they\u2019d imagined. Published in 2022, the latest of Silverberg\u2019s trio targets kids aged 10+. Photograph: Seven Stories Publishers \u201cThe books are queer,\u201d they say, \u201cbecause they\u2019re absolutely trying to make a world I want to live in, where there\u2019s nothing unusual about two boys having a crush on each other \u2013 but they always reflect the actual world, which I don\u2019t perceive as being super full of joy. When I see [a book] saying everything\u2019s great or it\u2019s all about love, I think: Well, that\u2019s not my world.\u201d Luckily Silverberg\u2019s world and their books do feature the things that most parents and children worry about, from watching porn to kissing with braces, sexual safety and boundaries. Choice and consent are always front and centre. At the end of You Know, Sex , the children are told: \u201cWe all deserve respect, trust, joy, justice, and lots of choices.\u201d It\u2019s fitting that Silverberg\u2019s closing words to me, a marker of their diligence and generosity of spirit, are questions that could just as well serve as the guiding principle for their work: \u201cHow was that? Do you have everything you need?\u201d What Makes a Baby, Sex is a Funny Word and You Know, Sex are published by Seven Stories Press",

Fluorescence found to be extremely common among mammals, being present in all known orders. Recently, several mammals have been reported to \"glow\" under ultraviolet (UV) light, including our beloved platypus. But no one knew how common it was among mammals until now. Our research, published in Royal Society Open Science today, found this glow \u2014 known as fluorescence \u2014 is extremely common. Almost every mammal we studied showed some form of fluorescence. We also examined the glow to determine if it was really fluorescence and not some other phenomenon. Then, we tested if the fluorescence we observed in museum specimens was natural and not caused by preservation methods. We also searched for links between the type and degree of fluorescence and the lifestyle of each species, to gain insights on whether there are any benefits to glowing under UV if you're a mammal. After platypus was shown to glow under UV light, couldn't resist trying bilbies... their ears and tails shine bright like a diamond! #bilby #uv pic.twitter.com/wL82RDdFYbNovember 3, 2020 See more Nightclub lights Nightclub visitors will be familiar with white clothes, or perhaps their gin and tonic, glowing blue under UV light. This is a great example of fluorescence \u2014 when the energy from UV light, which is a form of electromagnetic radiation invisible to humans, is absorbed by certain chemicals. These chemicals then emit visible light, which is lower-energy electromagnetic radiation. In the case of gin and tonic, this is due to the presence of the quinine molecule in the tonic water.

    "content": "Archaeologists in Scotland have discovered a rare pot of coins in the fireplace of Alasdair \"Maclain\" MacDonald, the massacred chief of the MacDonald clan. A cache of coins secreted away in a Scottish stone fireplace may have belonged to a clan chief killed in a 17th-century massacre, according to archaeologists excavating the remains of a hunting lodge in Glencoe. The diverse collection of coins was likely hidden by someone unable to return and retrieve them. Located in the highlands of western Scotland, Glencoe is now a national scenic area due to its numerous waterfalls and trails. But it is also infamous for a brutal and bloody conflict between the MacDonald clan and government forces in 1692. The MacDonalds of Glencoe were targeted for failing to pledge their allegiance to the monarchs William III and Mary II. More than 100 government soldiers were dispatched to round up and kill the MacDonalds, including their chief, Alasdair \"Maclain\" MacDonald, and ultimately several dozen clan members were massacred. Archaeological work this summer undertaken by the University of Glasgow identified Maclain's \"summerhouse,\" or a kind of hunting lodge and feasting hall used by the chief during his tenure from 1646\u2026 Kristina Killgrove",

    "content": "Several muscles could be called the \"largest\" in the body, depending on whether you're talking mass or surface area, but the body's smallest muscle has no competition. But have you ever wondered which muscle is the largest and which is the smallest? Your skeletal muscles are attached to your bones by tendons, and they enable you to move around and maintain an upright posture. Some muscles, such as those that help you smile or flex your fingers, are only a few inches long, while others, like those in your thighs, are big and bulky. But have you ever wondered which muscle is the largest and which is the smallest? The answers depend on whether the muscles are measured by mass or by surface area. The gluteus maximus is the largest muscle in the body by mass, D. Ceri Davies , former president of the Anatomical Society in the U.K., told Live Science by email. The best known of the glute muscles , the gluteus maximus runs diagonally from the top center of the pelvis to the femur, or thigh bone. It accounts for about 12% to 13% of the total weight of all the leg muscles, according to a study of adult cadavers . \"The gluteus maximus extends the thigh at the hip joint,\" Davies said. \"We use it when we get up from a chair, walking up steps or uphill. It needs to be powerful to move the weight of the entire upper body.\" Related: Why is it harder for some people to build muscle than others? There is one\u2026 Anna Gora",

    "content": "For decades, we thought the first humans to arrive in the Americas came across the Bering Land Bridge 13,000 years ago. New evidence is changing that picture. The first people to arrive in the Americas may have arrived around the Last Glacial Maximum, the coldest part of the last ice age (about 26,500 to 19,000 years ago). During the last ice age, humans ventured into two vast and completely unknown continents: North and South America. For nearly a century, researchers thought they knew how this wild journey occurred: The first people to cross the Bering Land Bridge, a massive swath of land that connected Asia with North America when sea levels were lower, were the Clovis, who made the journey shortly before 13,000 years ago. According to the Clovis First theory, every Indigenous person in the Americas could be traced to this single, inland migration, said Loren Davis , a professor of anthropology at Oregon State University. But in recent decades, several discoveries have revealed that humans first reached the so-called New World thousands of years before we initially thought and probably didn't get there by an inland route. So who were the first Americans, and how and when did they arrive? Genetic studies suggest that the first people to arrive in the Americas descend from an ancestral group of Ancient North Siberians and East Asians that mingled around 20,000 to 23,000 years ago. They crossed the Bering Land Bridge sometime between then and 15,500 years ago, said David Meltzer, an archaeologist and professor of prehistory in the Department of Anthropology at Southern Methodist University in Dallas and author of the book \"First Peoples in a New World, 2nd Edition\" (Cambridge University Press, 2021). But some archaeological sites hint that people may have reached the Americas far earlier than that. For instance, there are fossilized human footprints in White Sands National Park in New Mexico that may date to 21,000 to 23,000 years ago . That would mean humans arrived in North America during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), which occurred between about 26,500 to 19,000 years ago, when ice sheets covered much of\u2026 Laura Geggel",

    "content": "Archaeological discoveries throughout the Americas are pushing back the date for when humans reached the New World by thousands of years, rewriting the long-standing theory that people arrived only 13,000 years ago. Archaeological discoveries across the Americas have shaped our understanding of when and how humans first reached the so-called New World. The story told by artifacts unearthed from sites all the way from Alaska to Chile is hotly debated. According to the Clovis First theory, people crossed from Siberia into North America just over 13,000 years ago via the Bering Land Bridge \u2014 a mass of land that emerged when the last ice age lowered sea levels \u2014 and spread across the Americas. But in recent decades, archaeologists have unearthed much earlier evidence of people across North and South America , pushing back the date for this milestone in human history and casting doubt on how the first Americans got there . From giant sloth bones carved into pendants to underwater caches of mastodon bones, here are 13 of the oldest archaeological sites in the Americas. 1. Clovis, New Mexico People who occupied the Clovis site in New Mexico made distinctive stone weapons and spearpoints known as Clovis points (pictured). (Image credit: Sarah L. Anzick) Close to a ravine called Blackwater Draw in eastern New Mexico sits an archaeological site, discovered in 1929, that has shaped our understanding of how the Americas were peopled. The site was called Clovis due to its proximity to a town of that name and, throughout the 1930s, yielded stone artifacts, hearths and bones belonging to extinct animals \u2014 including mammoths \u2014 showing evidence of butchery dating to 13,000 years ago . Spearpoints discovered in Clovis have come to define a group of people who were long believed to be the first humans to arrive in the Americas, as well as their culture. These distinctive spearpoints were chipped from stone into finger-long projectiles that are now known as \"Clovis points\" and were found associated with animal bones.

Fox's Will Cain said the Israeli ambassador to the UN told him that \"dozens\" of Americans are being held hostage. A lot of people are looking at the Biden team's policies and how they may have factored into the attack. In particular, many were looking at the deal where the Biden team cut loose $6 billion - now being held in Qatar -- that can be utilized by Iran for humanitarian reasons like food and medicine.

    "content": "Yesterday was an overall bad day for Israel and for those who love freedom everywhere around the world. This, of course, includes those of us in the United States of America. Advertisement There are many reasons why people feel desperate enough to attack innocent civilians, but when it's done on this scale, at the core, I believe it is about differences in belief systems. Not everyone in the world believes as we do in the model of the Judeo-Christian tradition, which specifies the value of a single individual and their freedom to achieve whatever their God-given ability gives them the tools to do. A while after the shock of what happened yesterday morning had sunk in, I started to think about the consequences of these actions, and my thoughts naturally turned inward to this country, and I wondered how long before something like this would happen here. My colleague Ward Clark had some similar thoughts in his post called: Israel, Hamas, and Our Uncontrolled Border: Could It Happen Here? From his post. Could it happen here? My immediate answer is \"no,\" in that Hamas could not field a force to carry out operations in the United States on the scale they are conducting in Israel and surrounding regions Saturday. While they could easily infiltrate a large number of people across our wide-open southern border - more on that later - they cannot bring in the massive supplies of rockets and other heavy, crew-served weapons that they can easily bring to bear by transporting them on land routes from their primary supporter, Iran. But my more considered answer is \"No, not on the scale they are conducting in Israel -- but there's still a danger.\" The fact that Hamas isn't occupying land neighboring the U.S., as it does Israel, doesn't mean there's not a possible threat. Since President Biden took office, not quite three years ago, a horrifying 3.8 million illegal aliens have crossed into the United States across our porous southern border, and we have very little idea who\u2026 Duke",

    "description": "When Swiss International Air Lines loses Mark Bromley's luggage on a flight from Zurich to Geneva, he files a claim for compensation, but he never hears back. Does he deserve anything?",
    "content": "Swiss International Air Lines lost my luggage for eight days while I was on a hiking trip to Geneva. It sent my bags to the wrong address, then finally to my home almost two weeks later after our vacation had ended. Swiss never compensated me for the hiking gear I had to buy and never provided a mechanism in person, by phone or online to get reimbursed. The loss happened on a United Airlines codeshare flight from Washington, D.C., to Zurich, then a connecting flight on Swiss from Zurich to Geneva. Swiss has no process or points of contact online, or in person, at their airport counters for filing or getting reimbursed for lost luggage. It seems Swiss contracts all of its public interface activities to a company called Swissport. Swissport can file a complaint, but it has no authority to process a claim. I had a three-way conversation with supervisors from United Airlines and Swiss in the U.S. regarding compensation. The Swiss supervisor gave me the telephone number of their point of contact in the Missing Bag department, which Swissport runs, but no one there could help me either. So I\u2019m back to where I started. I, again, arranged a three-way call with United and Swiss, and this time, a representative recommended that I file a complaint with Lufthansa, the parent company of Swiss. I filed a complaint, but never heard from them. Can you help me? Swiss should have promptly compensated you for your lost luggage. Normally, an airline will cover items like toiletries and clothing when it misplaces your luggage. An airline representative should have helped you file a claim and then processed it quickly. By the time you contacted me, it had been almost six months since you filed your initial claim, which is far too long. Who is responsible for your loss? Typically, you should file a lost luggage claim with the operating carrier that delivers you to your final ticketed destination, which would have been Swiss. But it doesn\u2019t really matter who was there to take your claim \u2014 Swiss, Swissport, United or Lufthansa. Someone should have been there in Geneva to take care of you, and they should have authorized you to buy clothing and toiletries while you waited for your luggage. Your rights to compensation are governed by the Montreal Convention and the Swiss General Conditions of Carriage. Under these agreements, you are entitled to a maximum of $1,574 for your lost luggage. You also had an insurance policy through World Nomads, which would have compensated you $700 for the clothes you had to buy, but only if Swiss failed to pay you. You could have reached out to one of the executive contacts at Swiss who I publish on my consumer advocacy site, . But I suspect your case would have just gotten lost again between United, Lufthansa and Swiss. On a side note, this is one of the major problems of a codeshare arrangement. When something goes wrong, there\u2019s a lot of finger-pointing, and passengers are often the losers. I contacted Swiss on your behalf. A representative responded and said it had no record of your claim. Swiss suggested that you initiate a claim through its website, which you did. Ten months after your flight, the airline sent you $1,574.",

While we await word on the anime's future, all eyes are on Chainsaw Man's manga thanks to creator Tatsuki Fujimoto. And now, the series is channeling its spooky side with a special Halloween tribute. As you can see below, the main cast of Chainsaw Man was pulled together for the holiday treat. Some new promo art has gone live that dresses up everyone from Makima to Denji. After all, it seems the group is ready to nail their office Halloween party, and we're thinking Power is poised to take home first place.

If you are not familiar with a jiangshi, they are known as the Chinese hopping vampire. These monsters hail from folklore, and they hop around dead bodies in search of blood. Given Power's affinity for blood, you can see why this costume suits her, so we are giving her top prize at the costume contest. As for the others here, Denji is seen dressed as a pirate while Makima keeps things simple as a bloody nurse. Finally, Aki rounds up the gang in a tattered mummy costume. The hunter has wraps covering his torso, but Aki opted to wear slacks rather than make the mummy suit full body. But even so, we can all agree Aki rocks this look. This new Halloween tribute is just one of many coming from the anime universe. From Demon Slayer to Oshi no Ko, you can bet that most of the industry's top series are planning their Halloween celebrations already. Chainsaw Man is just ahead of the curve, so fans can start prepping their own Halloween-themed cosplays! If you are not familiar with Chainsaw Man, the series is perfect to watch for Halloween. The show can be found streaming on Crunchyroll. So for more information, you can read the official synopsis of Chainsaw Man below: \"Denji's a poor young man who'll do anything for money, even hunting down devils with his pet devil Pochita. He's a simple man with simple dreams, drowning under a mountain of debt. But his sad life gets turned upside down one day when he's betrayed by someone he trusts. Now with the power of a devil inside him, Denji's become a whole new man-Chainsaw Man!\" What do you think about this Halloween tribute? Are you keeping up with Chainsaw Man?

    "content": "Yesterday evening, U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken sent out this tweet, which we can't link to, because it was deleted. Read it and judge for yourself why: Wow. A cease-fire, after at least 9 Americans -- and a thousand Israelis -- were killed by Hamas. Mary Katharine Ham noticed and asked what we all were thinking: What? Could this administration be any more tone deaf? The deletion did not go unnoticed: Strange that it took over 12 hours for them to delete this tweet. This isn\u2019t the first time that the has put out messaging through official channels with capitulations to Hamas. It was up for 12 hours, and through an official channel. By my count, this is the second tweet this admin has deleted in the past two days. Both called for Israel to stand down. We are appalled that, after what we've seen on social media, the Biden administration would call for Israel to stand down. This is the worst one-day loss of Jewish life since the Holocaust. Israel cannot, should not, stand down under any circumstances. And not only did Blinken get dragged for the original tweet, the dragging continued after deleting it. Twitter/X never forgets, and rarely forgives: My God. It's horrifying. This is the Secretary of State. Utter ineptitude on display expecting this to have any positive effect. But he 'encouraged' a return of the hostages. \u201cencouraged\u201d Tough talk there, Tony. It's weak and insulting. Likely multiple State Department bureaus cleared this language before it went out. What cluelessness. Cluelessness is being far too kind. Appalling how inept our government officials are in this administration. It was intentional, not ineptitude, and only deleted because they got blowback. The internet is forever. We're glad, because they should not be allowed to delete this tweet and pretend it never happened. You'll notice that his subsequent tweets don't mention ceasefire. And he overcompensates like a bad dog afterwards. They're also not as forceful as they could be, honestly. Blinken deleted this tweet. Did he realize Turkey is with Hamas? Did he realize cease-fire doesn\u2019t make sense as Hamas is holding Israeli hostages? Told ya, wrong move\u2014this wasn\u2019t diplomacy but appeasement . It absolutely was appeasement. We've seen this from this administration before. It seems that US Secretary of State deleted yesterday's tweet where he \"encouraged\" Hamas-supporting Turkey arranging a cease-fire between Hamas and Israel. Are there any actual adults in charge in Foggy Bottom? Sure doesn't seem that way. Secretary of State Antony Blinken deleted his tweet calling for Turkey to broker a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. Thank goodness Twitter/X can still hold public officials accountable. Deleted tweet from Antony Blinken. Spot the problem. We spotted it. That is TWICE in 36 hours that this bumbling bunch of clowns have had to delete the same \"mistaken\" tweet. I can only conclude that a demand for ceasefire is the Administration's actual position behind closed doors, and that these incompetent imbeciles just keep blurting it out. This is a fair assessment. They don't say these things willy-nilly. This is the administration's position on the issue, even if they try (and fail) not to say it publicly. And where is Biden on this? Blinken's boss needs to clarify the administration's position. It'd be nice if he were physically capable of doing so. Good question. . ***",

Granted, we saw plenty from her fellow 'Squad members,' but at the end of the day, there is one rep who appears to truly despise Israel more than any other. How many times has Rashida Tlaib called them an apartheid state now? We've lost count. Welp, Tlaib has been very quiet since the shockingly violent clips of Hamas kidnapping children and raping/murdering women started making their way through traditional and social media. Many people are waiting to see her at least condemn the actions of Hamas. The rest of us aren't exactly holding our breath waiting for it because ultimately, we already know who she really is. She's been showing and telling us for years now. Interestingly enough, we know she's on Twitter because she's liking certain posts ... Squad Member isn't doing much talking about the terrorist invasion of Israel, but she is liking tweets padding her ego Yeah. She's all about her. Shocker, we know. Notice the one tweet also mentions apartheid ... guess she's got her talking points and she's sticking to them even after everything we've witnessed. Shocker, again. We'll continue to keep an eye on her feed and update as we see anything from her. *** Related: ***",

    "content": "Detectives are investigating after a skydiver was found dead in the front yard of a residence near an airpark in Florida, authorities said Saturday. A man outfitted in parachute attire and gear was located just before 12:30 p.m. on the lawn of a home in Titusville, about 50 miles east of Orlando, police said in a statement . The Titusville Fire Department responded and said the man was pronounced dead at the scene. A neighbor's surveillance video captured an SUV window's reflection, showing the skydiver descending before making a hard landing on the lawn, CBS affiliate WKMG reported. A skydiver died Saturday near an airpark in Titusville, according to firefighters. https://t.co/psqBj0KUnX \u2014 News 6 WKMG (@news6wkmg) October 8, 2023 James Sconiers told WKMG the man landed in his front yard. \"I was asking the person that was laying on the ground, 'Hey man can you hear me, can you hear me?' But he did not answer,\" Sconiers told the station. Sconiers told WKMG the incident left him with questions. \"Look at the video and look at what happened. Why did he fall so hard if all the safety mechanism was in place? Something tells me there's a problem there,\" he said. Nicole Lacount told WKMG that when she heard a fire truck and ambulance, she went outside of her aunt's house and saw the parachutist on the ground. \"I work in the medical field. That's the worst I've ever seen,\" she told the station. The Skydive Space Center is just a few blocks away. The center had no comment when WKMG asked if the parachutist came from their company. Police said more information, including the victim's name, would be released Monday, the station reported.

In the five-minute video, Cook addresses environmental questions, such as Apple\u2019s , what he does in his personal life to help the environment, and even if Apple needs to launch a new iPhone every year. Sign up for the most interesting tech & entertainment news out there. By signing up, I agree to the and have reviewed the To that question, Tim Cook said: \u201cI think having an iPhone every year for those people that want it is a great thing. And what we do is, we allow people to trade in their phone. And so, we then resell that phone if it\u2019s still working and if it\u2019s not working, we\u2019ve got ways of disassembling it and taking the materials to make a new iPhone out of.\u201d Ultimately, this question regards the fact that Apple wants to be carbon neutral by 2030. Brut\u2019s journalist says that many experts criticize the term \u201ccarbon neutral,\u201d as no company can achieve that in reality. To which, Tim Cook says: \u201cI\u2019d invite anybody to look at how we\u2019re defining it on our website because what we\u2019re doing is doing the hard work to lower our footprint dramatically and then whatever is left over, after doing all of these actions, we offset with high-quality offsets like managed forests and managed grasslands that pull carbon from the atmosphere. Our objective is to eliminate, as much as possible, prior to doing that. Apple\u2019s CEO conceived this interview as the company took European journalists to visit Apple\u2019s data center and photovoltaic installations in Denmark. Cook says that while Cupertino prefers to keep their products a secret before they\u2019re ready to announce, the environment is different. \u201cWith our initiatives like the environment, we want to be very open because we want to be copied. We want people to be able to look at this field and say \u2018I can do that too\u2019 and we want people to be able to look at our recyclable materials and say \u2018I can do that\u2019. And so all of these projects, we\u2019re being very open on, because we want to be the ripple in the pond that other people can look at and copy and it makes much more effect from an environmental point of view.\u201d The full video interview is worth watching. BGR will keep following Apple\u2019s plans to become carbon neutral, as well as its latest product announcements.",

    "content": "October 9, 2023 This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies . Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility: fact-checked peer-reviewed publication trusted source proofread by Li Yuan, Chinese Academy of Sciences Researchers from the Institute of Process Engineering (IPE) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Kyoto University have proposed a strategy to grow \"face-on\" and \"edge-on\" conductive metal-organic frameworks (cMOF) nanofilms on substrates by controlling the \"stand-up\" behaviors of ligands on various surfaces to overcome the difficulty in the orientation control of such films. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1449240174198-2'); }); They established operando characterization methodology using atomic force microscopy and X-ray to demonstrate the softness of the crystalline nanofilms and reveal their unique conductive functions. The study was published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences on Sept. 25. cMOFs have great potential for use in modern electrical devices due to their porous nature and the ability to conduct charges in a regular network. cMOFs applied in electrical devices normally hybridize with other materials, especially substrates. Therefore, precisely controlling the interface between a cMOF and a substrate is crucial. However, the unexplored interface chemistry of cMOFs makes the controlled synthesis and advanced characterization of high-quality thin films particularly challenging. Specifically, in contrast to the anticipated \"edge-on\" alignment of the 2D planes stemming from the hydrophilic -OH edge and the hydrophobic triphenylene core, the orientation observed experimentally is, in fact, the \"face-on\" configuration of the 2D planes on the substrates. \"The challenge lies in inducing the necessary high surface pressure to achieve a 'standing up' configuration of the core,\" said Prof. Yao Mingshui from IPE, first author of the study. In the Langmuir\u2013Blodgett (LB) technique, ligands with a hydrophobic core and a hydrophilic edge can adopt an upright orientation on hydrophilic surfaces when subjected to high surface pressure. \"Inspired by the 'standing up' behaviors, we employ ultra-high concentration, together with vigorous evaporation during spraying, to create a unique local high surface pressure that can induce the 'standing up' of HHTP (HHTP = 2,3,6,7,10,11-hexahydrotriphenylene) ligands. Accordingly, the 'face-on' and 'edge-on' thin films can be fabricated,\" said Prof. Kenichi Otake from Kyoto University, corresponding author of the study. Various reliable analyses were conducted to verify the crystallinity and orientation of the films with an ultra-thin thickness ranging from a few nanometers to tens of nanometers. \"The operando GIWAXS imaging and electrical monitoring revealed the anisotropic framework softness associated with electrical conductivity on the cMOF nanofilm. It answers the question whether the generally considered rigid Cu-HHTP can be soft,\" said Prof. Susumu Kitagawa from Kyoto University, corresponding author of the study. In addition to redox interactions, the structural softness has been confirmed to modulate the electrical conductivity in an anisotropic way.

    "description": "From picking a plan for the perks to not checking next year's network, here are some traps it\u2019s easy to fall into while shopping for Medicare Advantage.",
    "content": "Only 3 in 10 Medicare beneficiaries shop around during open enrollment, according to a 2022 analysis from KFF, a health policy nonprofit \u2014 and only 1 in 10 Medicare Advantage enrollees voluntarily switch plans. But a 2020 analysis of Medicare Advantage plan choices by the National Bureau of Economic Research found that more than half of beneficiaries overspent by more than $1,000 due to the plan they selected. is Oct. 15 to Dec. 7, giving people with Medicare a chance to change plans for the upcoming year. Although potential Medicare Advantage enrollees may be swayed by $0 premiums and extra perks like vision and dental coverage, there are more important features to explore when you\u2019re choosing next year\u2019s coverage. Here are some practices to avoid as you shop for Medicare Advantage this fall. If you\u2019re considering , understand that it\u2019s not the same thing as government-provided . It offers the same benefits, but Medicare Advantage is run by private health insurance companies and it operates differently. \u201cYou are essentially taking the Medicare coverage that you\u2019ve been provided by the government and turning that in,\u201d says Melinda Caughill, co-founder and CEO of 65 Incorporated, which offers Medicare guidance. You can switch back to Original Medicare during each year\u2019s open enrollment period, but you may not be able to qualify for an affordable Medicare Supplement Insurance, or , plan once you\u2019re past the . (Medigap helps with certain out-of-pocket costs not covered by Original Medicare.) Medicare Advantage plans operate within networks of medical providers, and you usually must see in-network doctors for covered care. \u201cA lot of people don\u2019t realize that \u2014 especially those $0-premium plans \u2014 they tend to have fairly confined networks,\u201d says Emily Gang, CEO of the Medicare Coach, a site that provides Medicare guidance. \u201cYou want to double-check that your doctor is actually an approved provider in that network.\u201d Ask your providers what insurance they\u2019ll be accepting in 2024, suggests Sarah Murdoch, director of client services for the Medicare Rights Center, a nonprofit consumer advocacy organization. It\u2019s easier than trying to check each plan\u2019s network individually. Like network providers, can also change each year. Your drug plan might cover one of your medications differently in 2024, leaving you with more out-of-pocket costs than you expected. \u201cIf you take even one brand name medication, your need to compare plans is incredibly high,\u201d Caughill says. No brand names on your list? Shop around if you take five or more medications in general. Medicare Advantage plans usually include benefits that aren\u2019t part of Original Medicare, such as dental, vision or hearing coverage. These extras may be appealing, but don\u2019t let them steer your plan choice. \u201cFirst of all, it\u2019s health insurance \u2014 so how is it going to cover your health care providers and your medications?\u201d says Katy Votava, who holds a doctorate in health economics and nursing and is president and founder of Goodcare, a consulting firm focused on the economics of Medicare. \u201cIf you pick [your plan] for a benefit that isn\u2019t health insurance, you\u2019re often picking wrong. And the dental benefit is pretty limited in all these plans \u2014 it\u2019s a couple of cleanings and some bite wings.\u201d The majority of Medicare Advantage enrollees are in plans with no premium, meaning you pay nothing each month for the plan. \u201cPeople see that $0 premium and they\u2019re like, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s free,\u2019 Gang says. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not.\u201d Research the rest of the before you sign up, including deductibles, copays, coinsurance and the out-of-pocket maximum, which is the most you might have to spend on covered care in a year. In 2023, the out-of-pocket max can be as high as $8,300 for in-network care. People eligible for Medicare are bombarded by information during open enrollment, and it can be overwhelming. \u201cThey don\u2019t shop,\u201d Votava says. \u201cThey go with name recognition or what their friend has.\u201d The better choice: Focus on your own situation and find the plan that meets your needs. If you need help, contact your , or SHIP, for free Medicare guidance. Just don\u2019t wait until the last minute, because appointments fill up, Votava says. \u201cIf you need individual help, you\u2019d better get on the list.\u201d",

    "content": "by: Posted: Updated: BENTON COUNTY, Ark. (KNWA/KFTA) \u2014 A pair of Bentonville men arrested for stealing $100,000 in silver coins from a 15-year-old boy after luring him from his home have pleaded not guilty. Nathaniel Tyler Archer, 28, and Nicholas Patrick Padgett, 30, were arrested on April 24 this year. Archer is charged with theft by receiving, bestiality and distributing, possessing or viewing matter depicting sexually explicit conduct involving a child. Padgett is charged with theft by receiving. According to an affidavit, the Bentonville Police Department received an assistance request from the Adams Township Police Department in Pennsylvania in locating Padgett and Archer with active warrants for interference with custody of children, receiving stolen property and theft by unlawful taking or disposition. Archer and Padgett were accused of luring a 15-year-old boy from his residence to transport him to Arkansas. When the juvenile left the residence, he had in his possession 23 buckets that contained JFK half-ounce silver dollar coins valued at $100,000-$140,000. Court documents say that while traveling to Arkansas, the minor expressed no longer wishing to leave and was stranded at a motel in St. Roberts, Missouri. Padgett and Archer reportedly assisted the juvenile in loading the buckets into Padgett\u2019s car before he was left behind. The men were later found and arrested in Bentonville. Police found a backpack in Padgett\u2019s bedroom that contained 499 silver coins. His car was searched and rendered the discovery of 11 buckets inside the trunk containing around 11,000 silver coins. A search of Archer\u2019s residence revealed 12 buckets containing around 11,000 silver coins as well. Court documents say that the two were interviewed and admitted to executing the plan to pick up the juvenile and abandon him on the way to Arkansas. Upon returning to Bentonville, they each took around half of the silver coins. Court documents add that Archer is accused of performing an act of sexual gratification with an animal on April 23. Padgett is due for a jury trial on Dec. 12 in Benton County. Copyright 2023 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.",

The attacks online are targeting Tyler Cherry, Interior\u2019s principal deputy communications director, and started when the right-wing social media account LibsofTikTok criticized Cherry\u2019s appearance on X, formerly known as Twitter. The account shared photographs and old posts from Cherry last week, which sparked an online debate and led to conservative voices bashing him online. The Biden administration pushed back Sunday, The Washington Post , and defended Cherry as an invaluable member of the team. \u201cNo one should be targeted simply for being themselves. It is cruel and unacceptable,\u201d the White House said in a statement. \u201cThis is an administration that believes to our core in the principle that out of many we are one \u2014 and we are proud that the people who serve in it reflect those values as well. Tyler is an invaluable member of our team who continues to deliver for the Department of the Interior and the American people.\u201d The debate included conversations over Cherry\u2019s style and what it means to appear professional, with \u201cThe Trumpertarian\u201d , \u201cThis is Tyler Cherry\u2026 the new communications director for the Secretary of Interior of the Biden regime.

Ted Cruz (R-Texas) \u201cone of the radical leftists in the Biden admin.\u201d Cherry is also an LGBTQ rights activist and is part of a queer DJ collective in Washington, D.C., the Post reported.

    "content": "Mashed potatoes are one of those comforting side dishes that's met with nostalgic memories and heartwarming reactions. There are many ways to , yet one yet to be addressed is how it can be made to suit a potluck. Amidst the frenzy of serving spoons and eager guests diving to the serving table for a quick nibble, mashed potatoes often don't present a visually appealing addition to the party plate. There is a solution if you still want spuds to take center stage; the answer is mashed potato salad. Mashed potato salad is a dish that's reminiscent of potato salad and mashed potatoes. It combines fresh, crunchy ingredients with mashed potatoes, potato chunks, and a creamy dressing to create a delicious potluck winner that unites attractive elements of both dishes: Texture and flavor. This salad can use either leftover mashed potatoes or very tender boiled potatoes. Ideally, if you're using the latter, the best way to achieve a chunkier texture is to cook the potatoes for longer than you would for potato salad and then half-heartedly mash them. You want them to have a slightly fluffy exterior but a chunkier yet tender center, which will wonderfully take on the flavor of the dressing and add some texture contrast. It's filling, comforting, and utterly irresistible. This will surely be a hit at your next potluck. One of the most remarkable aspects of this salad lies in its adaptability. It can be made with partially, entirely, or leftover mashed potatoes. While the partially mashed potatoes will provide a tender bite, if you're using fully mashed potatoes, you can rest assured that you will add crispiness and texture with the fresh ingredients. Alongside the potatoes, this salad can also be highly versatile in dressings and extras. Dressings can include a mixture of mayonnaise, mustard, or sour cream. These will give the salad a creamy edge bordering on mashed potato territory. However, with the addition of crunchy vegetables, like chopped radish, celery, red onion, or scallions, it still stands firmly in the salad realm. If you're using leftover mashed potatoes that have already been seasoned, consider this when flavoring the salad. This salad also has the advantage of capturing the eye with some vibrant glints of colors. Picture the pink radish, green scallions, or bright yellow egg drawing attention and intrigue at the potluck table. Lastly, one of the ultimate reasons to try this out is its temperature flexibility, as this salad can easily be served warm on colder days or chilled when the hot weather passes through. If you ever have the pleasure of venturing to an izakaya, a casual Japanese bar serving small plates, you may be lucky enough to find mashed potato salad on the menu. This mashed potato salad is an absolute culinary gem. Seasoned with Japanese mayonnaise, like , and rice vinegar, the salad has a moreish tang and deeply savory flavor. It's one of those dishes that makes you instantly smile. The Japanese mashed potato salad may include crunchy carrots, salted cucumbers, crispy bacon slices, and chopped eggs. The slightly mashed potatoes meld with the umami flavor of the Japanese mayonnaise to bring the rest of the ingredients together and create an insatiable salad. The borders of your imagination limit what you incorporate into this mashed potato salad. Fluffy, crunchy, and smothered in a creamy dressing, this salad is sure to be a favorite at your next potluck.",

    "content": "Landscape photography, at its core, is more than just a visual art form; it's a profound emotional experience. It's the art of capturing feelings, not just scenes. I want to take you on a journey through my lens to explore how photography transcends mere pixels and lenses, with my backdrop being the unforgettable Storm Agnes adventure at the Devil's Horns in Dingle. Photography is unique among the arts because it can freeze a single moment in time, preserving not only the image but also the emotions that accompany it. Every photograph is a testament to the photographer's emotions, intentions, and perspective at that precise instant. As I stood at the edge of the roaring sea, battling the tempestuous winds during the tumultuous Storm Agnes in Dingle, my camera became an extension of my emotional state. The crashing waves and the majestic Devil's Horns evoked awe, wonder, and fear simultaneously. Each click of the shutter was a release of pent-up emotions, an attempt to encapsulate the visceral experience. I felt at times that I wouldn't be able to get a sharp shot, due to the relentless power of the wind coupled with the ferocious size and speed of the waves. Nonetheless, I continued to hammer my shutter button every time a wave approached, and to be honest, this was every few seconds, so overall, my feeling of missing the moment would only be fleeting, as I would have another chance to catch the next one as it roared towards us and crashed against the rocky cliffs. One of photography's most enchanting aspects is the dance between light and shadow. It's this interplay that not only creates visually striking images but also stirs deep emotional responses. During my Storm Agnes adventure, the ever-changing light added layers of emotion to my photographs. The dark, menacing clouds cast an ominous pall over the scene, heightening the sense of drama and foreboding. But occasionally, the sun broke through, casting a surreal, golden glow over the tumultuous sea. These moments of light were like fleeting glimpses of hope amid the chaos, and they infused our photographs with a unique blend of emotions\u2014awe, anticipation, and even a touch of serenity. As you will already know well, photography isn't just about pointing and shooting. It's about carefully composing an image to convey a specific emotion or message. The composition of a photograph can evoke a wide range of feelings. In the midst of Storm Agnes, the Devil's Horns stood as symbols of resilience and strength. Their jagged, defiant forms contrasted sharply with the chaotic sea. Framing the shot to include both the furious waves and the unwavering rocks created a composition that spoke of the enduring power of nature and evoked a sense of admiration and respect. This was made harder due to the wind, plus my bold decision to shoot only handheld. This decision was made due to the very nature of my subjects, fast-moving waves, and light, which meant I needed to be fluid, and because I was going to be shooting at fast shutter speeds, I felt I didn't need the extra baggage of the tripod. Color plays a pivotal role in photography, affecting the emotions a photograph elicits. Storm Agnes offered a dramatic palette of colors, from the deep blues and grays of the raging sea to the warm, rays of light that teased us as they bounced off the islands in the distance. The cool, moody blues of the stormy sea conveyed a sense of depth and mystery. They mirrored the intensity of the moment, inviting viewers to feel the vastness of the ocean's power. In contrast, the warm colors of the glowing light from the sun that periodically peaked out from behind the clouds hinted at the promise of contrast and texture on the water, fostering a sense of hope amid the chaos. In general, photography is often a deeply personal form of self-expression. It can be a therapeutic outlet for processing and conveying emotions. Storm Agnes was a tumultuous and challenging experience, both physically and emotionally. But through photography, I was able to channel my emotions into something tangible and share them with others. Each photograph taken during that stormy day in Dingle tells a story \u2014 a story of resilience in the face of nature's fury, a story of awe in the presence of untamed power and a story of camaraderie among fellow photographers. Nigel, Mads, and Michael all felt the power of this storm also, and this would fuel them as the day went on too. We may have at times felt wind-swept, uncomfortable and like giving up. However, the sheer power of this storm and the promise of what was to come kept us transfixed on the mission and the goals of capturing some stunning shots to match our feelings. It's a cathartic experience to revisit those images and relive the emotions they carry. Photography is storytelling without words. Each photograph is a narrative, a frozen moment in time that invites viewers to weave their own stories and emotions into the image. Our Storm Agnes adventure became a tale of bravery, determination, and the enduring love for the art of photography. As viewers look at our photographs, we hope they can immerse themselves in the narrative. They can feel the wind whip through their hair, taste the salt in the air, and hear the deafening roar of the waves. It's a testament to the power of photography to transcend time and space and evoke emotions in those who behold the image. I certainly had all of these feelings during my shoot, and even at times felt the wind as it tried to lift my eyelids from my face. Photographs, once captured, have an enduring impact. They become time capsules of emotions, transporting viewers back to the moment when the image was taken. Our Storm Agnes photographs continue to evoke a sense of awe, wonder, and respect for the forces of nature. Every time someone views one of those images, they are transported to that stormy day on the cliffs of Dingle. They can feel the rush of adrenaline, the tingling of excitement, and the reverence for nature's power. It's a testament to the emotional resonance that photography can achieve. These are the feelings I have when editing my shots from there, and if I can evoke any similar feelings in the viewer, then that's half the future battle done too. Photography is not merely about capturing what the eye sees; it's about capturing what the heart feels. It's a means of translating emotions, experiences, and moments into a visual medium that can be shared and appreciated by others. Our Storm Agnes adventure in Dingle exemplified how photography can transcend the visual to become a visceral and emotional experience. So, the next time you pick up your camera and frame a shot, remember that you're not just capturing an image; you're capturing a feeling, a moment in time infused with your emotions and your unique perspective. And in doing so, you're sharing a piece of your soul with the world. Even if you don't have the crazy conditions we had, I am sure that there will still be a feeling that lasts a lot longer than the shoot. Photography is an art of emotion, and every click of the shutter is an opportunity to convey the depths of the human experience in our images. Print your shots and put them on a wall at home, so you too can be reminded of those feelings you had when hitting that shutter button Have you more to add to this? Have you a particular image(s) that evoke emotions and feelings each time you look at it, or perhaps your images have evoked feelings in other viewers? I'd love to hear your stories in the comments below. Darren J. Spoonley, is an Ireland-based outdoor photographer, Podcaster, Videographer & Educator with a passion for capturing the beauty of our world.",

The Stephen King adaptation ended up grossing $82.3 million worldwide, likely earning a little cash for the 20th Century horror. Though a sequel has yet to be ordered from the studio, Boogeyman helmer Rob Savage tells us he has a splendid idea that will both work as a sequel, or as a standalone flick. \"I tell you what: there's an idea for a sequel that me and Mark Haymen have, which is one of the best movie ideas that I've ever heard or ever been a part of developing,\" Savage tells ComicBook.com's Chris Killian. \"Even if it wasn't a Boogeyman movie, it would still be a unique, completely fresh horror movie that has the potential to be a classic. The fact that it can so tie in so perfectly to the story we told in The Boogeyman. I'm so excited for it, but I don't know if that'll happen. The studio will decide that and the fans will decide that and people flock to it when it goes to Hulu.\" This isn't the first time Savage has touted a potential sequel, with the filmmaker previously telling us the idea may be better served as a standalone film or something adjacent to The Boogeyman . \"I'm really praying that this movie plays well enough to get a sequel because we've got an incredible idea for a sequel,\" Savage told ComicBook.com . \"Me and the team, and Mark Heyman who wrote this one. I think you'd have to include this cast of characters, they're so fundamental to the character and the personality of this movie. That being said, it comes at the horror in a different way. It feels like its own thing. And it's the kind of horror movie that, even if it wasn't a sequel, it would be something I'd be so excited to do, and a story I'd really love to tell. But to make it as a sequel to this movie, in the world of Boogeyman, would be a dream. So I hope this movie doesn't flop so I can come make that .\" The Boogeyman is on Digital now and comes to Blu-ray and DVD on October 10th. 0 comments Related: The Boogeyman Gets Hulu Release Date Where to Watch The Boogeyman Online Stephen King's The Boogeyman Gets Home Video Release Date The Boogeyman Director Teases a \"Whole Horror Movie\" Worth of Prequel Lore",

    "content": "Social media platforms see people going viral for a number of reasons, with the sheer volume of users resulting in a brief shelf life for anyone who becomes a trending topic in any medium. Back in 2017, however, one journalist's chronicle of the bizarre occurrences he was experiencing in his apartment not only earned a short-term notoriety, but with the events unfolding over a number of months, this Twitter thread was a talking point for much longer than usual. The real-life events have been brought to life as the film Dear David by director John McPhail , which hits theaters, On Demand, and Digital HD on October 13th. The film is described, \"Shortly after comic artist Adam (Augustus Prew) responds to internet trolls, he begins experiencing sleep paralysis -- while an empty rocking chair moves in the corner of his apartment. As he chronicles increasingly malevolent occurrences in a series of tweets, Adam begins to believe he is being haunted by the ghost of a dead child named David. Encouraged by his boss to continue the 'Dear David' thread, Adam starts to lose his grip on what is online...and what is real. Based on the viral Twitter thread by BuzzFeed comic artist Adam Ellis.\" ComicBook.com caught up with McPhail to talk adapting the story, ghost stories in the digital age, and more. (Photo: Lionsgate/Stephanie Montani) ComicBook.com: I know that this is a movie that's been a long time coming. Ever since that Twitter thread went viral, people have been wanting to see it brought to life. When you look back, did you have any connection to that Twitter thread while it was happening or did the movie just come about much later and bring up your awareness of it? John McPhail: No, no, no. I was following it in 2017. I didn't find it on Twitter, I found it on one of those, \"The scariest things on the Internet,\" one of those things, and I was totally hooked. I suffer from sleep psychosis. It's not like sleep paralysis where I see things at the end of my bed or anything like that, so I connected with him at that point, because from what I suffer from, I feel like I can't breathe, I can't talk, I can't scream, and I've got this pressure pushing down on me, and my fiance's waking me up, and I'm going, \"Ach.\" When this script landed on my desk, I was like, \"I know this. I know this.\" And as I said, the first things I thought about was all that sleep paralysis stuff, and was like, \"Oh, I'm looking forward to doing that.\" Once you got involved with this project, did you reach out to Adam much? Did you consult with him much? And then, also related to that, do you believe him about what he went through? Does it even matter? We did connect. BuzzFeed connected us as I was coming onto the project. We were coming into pre-production, because my designer Josh Tompkin and I, we wanted to, not recreate the flat or his apartments, we wanted to have a bit of license with it, but I wanted to put things in there for fans of the original thread. This film takes a bit of dramatic license and veers off, but I knew I was going to upset a couple of folks, but I wanted to give them some things. I wanted to give them the two cats. I wanted to have furniture from the apartment and areas that they would recognize and get excited about. He shared his comic books with me. He shared his photographs. He's in the film. He's in the background in a scene. And he was on set for a couple of days, so it was really nice to meet him and hang out with him. And yeah, he was super helpful with stuff like that. Since this is a ghost story and you're taking dramatic license, does the truth of it all really even matter to you as a filmmaker? I think that we tried to play with a little bit of that in the film, in the sense of that ... The question you're always asking is, did this happen or does he make it all up? I wanted to have that feeling of, \"Is this actually happening or is he losing his mind?\" and play with it in that sense so that that question was still always hanging around there. Look, I believe. I've always felt like I've been guided along in life and guided down certain paths and things, so I believe. And so if he's made it all up, that's some commitment, real commitment, and you've got to applaud him for that. So I don't know. I asked him. He said \"It happened,\" so I take the guy's word for it. When it came to the visual design of David, when it came to translating that really rudimentary, two-dimensional image, that drawing in the real world into this film, what was that process like? Was it pretty straightforward or were there a lot of different variations on that visual look? I've got a concept artist who, we just connected over Zoom. Obviously, this was during the COVID times and things, and he'd sketched out a whole bunch of stuff, and we went back and forth with the studio and stuff like that, what it was going to look like. And then, when we got there, my prosthetics guy, two Daniels, literally my makeup and prosthetic designer came together, and we talked about what that wound would look like. I didn't want to go quite medical with a lot of it. I just wanted it to look cool and creepy and scary, and yeah. So we'd taken a little bit of fun with it. When the script came to you, was there a specific scene or sequence that when you came to it, you were like, \"Okay, I've got to do this. I'm absolutely hooked,\" or since you were a fan of the Twitter thread early on, was it just as soon as the script came across your desk, you were like, \"Oh, whatever the script is, I'm on board,\"? It was Adam Ellis, the character, and the guy, because one of the things that ... Back in 2017, I stalked him a wee bit, going, \"Is this real? Is this actually happening? Am I going to find something?\" And he's a really funny, cynical, in-your-face kind of guy, and this story just didn't feel like it would've come from him ... And that in-your-face, cynical, laughing at trolls and stuff and pushing back, that kind of guy would be fun to see him go through this and have that journey with him. That's what always draws me to a film, is always the character, that and the computer-game sequence. It was just this little bit in the script, but I was like, \"Oh man, this could be so much fun and could be a total nod to A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 , Freddy [Krueger], the puppet part where he is getting puppeted about.\" And when I was watching that, I was like, \"Oh, the peril in that part of the sequence comes from his friends.\" And so I brought in this cam where we're getting to see him in his own head as he's being puppeteered about and I got really excited about that. Augie, Augustus, who plays Adam, threw himself into that, so I loved shooting that, that whole sequence. So him pouring the booze over himself, crying and screaming, oh, it was so much fun, so, so much fun. Generally speaking, what is so fascinating about urban legends in the digital age, as opposed to the guy with hooks for hands scratching on the car? What makes digital, contemporary urban legends so appealing and so fascinating? I think it is just because it's new. It's still new. And particularly for this, because there was such an online presence with it, it was like, that had to have some sort of impact to the story and playing with it in that way, and, as I say, trying to compare a haunting to trolling. I feel there's this parallel where outside forces come into your safe space, and that was something that really appealed to us. Dear David hits theaters, On Demand, and Digital HD on October 13th.

    "content": "Some of John Cena 's old promos are coming back to bite him. Leading up to his \"once in a lifetime\" clash with Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson at WWE WrestleMania 28 , Cena blasted Rock for neglecting his roots. Up until his return in 2011, Rock had not been seen inside a WWE ring for seven years. Big Match John criticized Rock for going Hollywood on the WWE fans and leaving the place and people that made him in the dust. Now one decade later, Cena finds himself in the same predicament. Cena has not been a full-time member of the WWE roster since 2016 and has wrestled just a handful of matches in the past couple of years. John Cena \"Violated\" The Rock's Trust (Photo: WWE) Speaking during the WWE Fastlane press conference, John Cena once again admitted that he was in the wrong for his criticisms of The Rock's priorities in the entertainment industry during their feud. \"Publicly and personally, to Dwayne Johnson, I've stated that, although I thought I was trying to do what's best for business, I went about it the wrong way,\" Cena said. \"I violated his trust, and I made allegations about his perspective that I knew nothing about. Deep down, I was a fan. I wanted The Rock [back], and I wanted to do anything to get The Rock back, but I did it the wrong way. I didn't do it the respectful way, so I had to eat a little bit of crow.\" Why Can't John Cena Wrestle and Act Simultaneously? (Photo: WWE, DC) As evident by his sporadic appearances this year, John Cena is capable of fitting WWE into his busy schedule. That said, Cena has only wrestled three matches this year, and is moving at a speed that is significantly less risky compared to the work-rate bouts his was putting on in the 2010s. As Cena emphasized, his current limited matches and in-ring style is a byproduct of his obligations in Hollywood. \"I made it perfectly clear you can't do both because of the liability insurance,\" Cena explained. \"If I were trying to juggle both that's very selfish because I'd put a whole lot of people in the movie business out of work if something happened to me.\" Cena's sudden availability came about due to the SAG-AFTRA strike. Hollywood productions have been on pause since the actors guild went on strike in mid-July. \"I stopped a project in the middle of [the strike], and I cant talk about it because of the strike we're in,\" Cena added. \"We're in the middle of it. As soon as we get back to work, we go back to work. I don't control any of that. I'm crossing my fingers and hoping we can find a resolve that everyone is happy with. For right now, I think this is the best way I can help, by coming home to my [WWE] family.\" 0 comments Related: WWE Fastlane: John Cena and LA Knight Defeat the Bloodline Watch: Unheard Conversation Between John Cena and The Rock From WWE WrestleMania 29 Revealed The Rock and John Cena Reunite on WWE SmackDown John Cena Responds to Possibility of a Third WWE Match Against The Rock",

    "content": "\u200bAmerica faces serious challenges. Our cities are being ruined by progressive soft-on-crime policies that keep criminals on the streets and storefronts closed. President Biden\u2019s radical open-border policies have made our country less safe, eaten up budgets of cities across the country, and made the fentanyl crisis even worse. Out-of-control spending has caused massive inflation and burdened our children and grandchildren with crushing debt. \u200bThe American people elected Republicans to serve as a check on these policies in the House of Representatives. Our majority has achieved a lot in nine months. We moved a strong to address the crisis at the southern border. We\u2019ve to protect American families and an . Our majority is also conducting rigorous oversight to not only hold the Biden administration accountable, but ensure the federal bureaucracy is not weaponized. It\u2019s no secret that Republicans in the House are split and emotions are high. Democrats want to exploit our challenges to weaken our party and pave the way for further far-left policies. Now is the time for Republicans to come together and unify for the sake of the country and our future. Our wounds won\u2019t heal overnight, and we may never all agree on every piece of policy, but we need to work together. There are two fundamental questions in this race for Speaker: who can best unite the Republican conference and who can best communicate our shared conservative vision to the American people? On both these important questions, Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) is the best man for this tough assignment at this pivotal moment. The Speaker must be a leader. He must recognize the different talents of our diverse conference and encourage members to maximize on their strengths. This is the approach Jim Jordan exhibited since I first met him in 1996 when he was a member of the Ohio General Assembly. It\u2019s the approach he\u2019s taken as the leading Republican on two House committees. Jim is a listener and a leader. He is humble and sincere. Anyone who has served with Jim on a committee knows the kind of man he is and how he empowers members to succeed. The Speaker, as the chief spokesman for Republicans in Congress, must fiercely advocate for our conservative agenda in Washington and in congressional districts across the country. Jim is simply the best communicator for Republicans in the country. He can articulate our conservative vision for America \u2014 what Republicans are doing and why it matters for Americans. Our problems are serious, and our challenges are steep. We need leaders like Jim Jordan now more than ever. Republicans in the House must unite behind a speaker who can build trust in all corners of our conference. Someone who can bring us together. That\u2019s why I am supporting Jim Jordan for Speaker of the House of Representatives.",
