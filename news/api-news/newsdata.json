    "description": "An interview with the outgoing House Speaker",
    "content": "Ever since the election, Nancy Pelosi says, congressional Democrats have been begging her to remain as their leader. Of course, she knew what they were really doing: currying favor, just in case. \u201cOur members were just exploding my phone to stay,\u201d she says, \u201cwhich is a nice thing, because if I don\u2019t stay, then they\u2019ve gotten the points for saying \u2019stay,\u2019 and if I do\u2014\u201c she trailed off, laughing. No matter what she decided, they knew it would be in their interest to be on her good side going forward. For two decades, it has been in every congressional Democrat\u2019s interest to stay in Pelosi\u2019s good graces. Since winning her first leadership position in 2001, she has ruled the House Democratic caucus with an iron fist and a velvet glove, keeping her fractious party in near-lockstep during historically tumultuous times. From the Iraq War to the financial crisis, through health-care reform and government shutdowns, through two presidential impeachments, a pandemic and an insurrection attempt, she has been a constant force and consummate operator. No national politician of her era can match her combination of legislative prowess, vote-counting savvy, negotiating skill, and fundraising ability. [time-brightcove not-tgx=\u201dtrue\u201d] On Thursday, it was finally time to move on\u2014sort of. Shortly after noon, she gave a brief speech on the House floor, announcing that she would not seek re-election as leader of the House Democrats. It was time, she said, \u201cfor a new generation to lead the Democratic caucus that I so deeply respect.\u201d Yet she couldn\u2019t bring herself to step away completely: she owed it to her constituents in San Francisco, she said, to stay on as a rank-and-file member of Congress and finish her two-year term. Like the man who fakes his own death and then sneaks into the funeral, she would stick around to see how her people tried to get along without her. Chip Somodevilla\u2014Getty ImagesNancy Pelosi waves to colleagues while being nominated as the next Speaker of the House during a swearing in ceremony for the 110th Congress in the House Chamber of the U.S. Capitol in Washington, DC., on Jan. 4, 2007. Just after her speech, the 82-year-old House Speaker sat at a white-clothed table in a small, ornate room off the House floor known as the Board of Education, a hidden chamber where former Democratic Speaker Sam Rayburn used to hole up and relax. Then-vice president Harry Truman was playing cards with Rayburn here in 1945 when he learned that FDR had died and he would become President. One wall Rayburn had painted with a Texas seal; on two others, Pelosi recently added her own touches: a painting of the Golden Gate Bridge, and a tribute to women\u2019s suffrage. Pelosi was contemplating the not-quite-end of the era and struggling to unwrap a package of chocolate-chip cookies. \u201cWhat was important to me was how we did in the election, because we were on a bad path,\u201d she told a small group of reporters. \u201cStorming the Capitol, really? And the reaction of Republicans, not taking a stand? And I knew we could win.\u201d Her party had just lost the House, weeks after a crazed intruder broke into her California home and bludgeoned her husband with a hammer. But it hardly felt as if Pelosi was giving up in defeat. In an election that history and many forecasters predicted would deliver a Republican wave, Democrats surprisingly held their own. The resulting GOP majority will be a narrow one, with the Senate remaining in Democrats\u2019 hands. The Oct. 28 attack on Paul Pelosi, the Speaker\u2019s husband of 59 years, influenced her decision to remain in Congress, but not in the way many people thought. \u201cIt was not, \u2018Oh, well, since they did that, I can\u2019t even think of something else,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cNo, it had the opposite effect. I couldn\u2019t give them that satisfaction.\u201d Read More: Nancy Pelosi Doesn\u2019t Care What You Think Of Her. This steely tenaciousness, this refusal to let others decide her path, is a running theme of my biography of Pelosi. It has been the hallmark of her political career, from forcing her way into the male-dominated ranks of congressional leadership to standing up to former President Donald Trump. As the youngest child and only daughter of three-term Baltimore mayor Thomas D\u2019Alessandro, politics was in Pelosi\u2019s blood; she first set foot on the House floor as a young child, when her father was serving in Congress. But when she finally ran for office herself at the age of 47\u2014after raising five children and serving for decades as a political fundraiser, strategist and volunteer\u2014it was from a different coast, under a different name, with a political identity all her own. Deanne Fitzmaurice\u2014San Francisco Chronicle/Getty ImagesNancy Pelosi at election headquarters on primary election night, on April 7, 1987. Ask Pelosi about her legacy, and the first thing she\u2019ll mention is the Affordable Care Act. However flawed and incomplete the 2010 law\u2019s guarantee of universal access to health care may have proven, it represented the fulfillment of a century of liberal aspirations, and the pinnacle of Pelosi\u2019s legislative craft. She moved mountains to get it through the House, at one point nearly breaking down in tears as she begged a group of liberal feminists to swallow an unsavory compromise on abortion funding. Then, after a special election robbed Democrats of their supermajority in the Senate, she urged then-President Obama not to give up on the historic legislation. \u201cIf the gate\u2019s closed, you go over the fence,\u201d she said at the time. \u201cIf the fence is too high, we\u2019ll pole-vault in. If that doesn\u2019t work, we\u2019ll parachute in. But we\u2019re going to get health-care reform passed for the American people.\u201d Though most of the drama around the bill\u2019s passage revolved around the Senate, it never could have happened without Pelosi\u2019s determination and drive. Win McNamee\u2014Getty ImagesSpeaker of the House Nancy Pelosi stands behind President Barack Obama as he signs the Affordable Health Care for America Act during a ceremony with fellow Democrats in the East Room of the White House on March 23, 2010. She did it knowing there might be a political cost, and indeed there was. Republicans gained 63 seats in the House in the 2010 midterm elections, an election in which Pelosi was a central figure. Republicans made her the subject of millions of dollars\u2019 worth of attack ads across the country, capitalizing on their base\u2019s visceral loathing of her and giving Peosi unusual prominence for a congressional leader. But Pelosi believed in gaining power not for its own sake but in order to do something with it. Obamacare is part of a legacy that includes two decades of liberal policy victories, from allowing gay people to serve openly in the military to the historic climate investments of this year\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act. \u201cThis is a very difficult job,\u201d she told us. \u201cYou have to really know how to be a legislator.\u201d These legislative successes were all the more remarkable for the era in which they came. Faced with unrelenting Republican opposition, she held together the diverse Democratic caucus and drove a hard bargain in negotiations across the aisle. After Donald Trump became president, she led her party back to power, becoming Speaker for the second time in 2019 in the middle of a government shutdown over border-wall funding. Pelosi refused to budge, and Trump soon capitulated. She would go on to impeach him twice while simultaneously negotiating with his Administration to secure trillions in COVID-19 relief funding.

Pelosi rejects the notion that she bears any blame for the toxic state of politics. \u201cI don\u2019t take any responsibility for what the Republicans have done to the Congress. This is not about gridlock,\u201d she says. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about some sort of equivalence between Democrats and Republicans. They are anti-science, anti-government, and that\u2019s where they are.\u201d The GOP\u2019s lack of decency was apparent in many Republicans\u2019 reaction to her husband\u2019s attack, Pelosi says. \u201cJust think if your spouse were in that situation and people would make a joke of it, like it was funny,\u201d she added. \u201cCollecting money for bail for the perpetrator, putting out a conspiracy theory about what it was about. It\u2019s so horrible to think that the Republican Party has come down to this.\u201d This attitude, she says, was part of what voters recoiled from the midterms. Mark Wilson\u2014Getty Images (2); Chip Somodevilla\u2014Getty Images; Jim Watson\u2014Pool/AFP/Getty Images Pelosi never groomed a successor, something for which she was often criticized. Ambitious Democrats languished for decades waiting for an opening in House leadership. She has often expressed the view that power is never given but must be taken by those who seek it. \u201cI didn\u2019t think that was the right approach, to anoint somebody,\u201d she told us Thursday. \u201cIt\u2019s really important for people to have the legitimacy that they were chosen by the members.\u201d A free-for-all appears unlikely. Pelosi\u2019s longtime deputy Steny Hoyer, a fellow Marylander who has known her since they worked for the same Senator in 1963, announced Thursday that he would also stay in Congress but not in leadership. Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York, the 52-year-old chair of the Democratic caucus, appears almost certain to win the minority leader position in the Democratic leadership elections scheduled for Nov. 30, becoming the first Black man to lead a party in Congress. The first woman Speaker, in passing the torch, will make history once again. Pelosi intends to spend the next two years in valedictory mode. \u201cMy life ahead is full of thank-yous,\u201d she says, to her constituents and all the others who have supported her over the years. She does not plan to serve on any committees and she does not want to serve as a sort of shadow speaker from the sidelines. \u201cThanksgiving is coming,\u201d she says. \u201cI have no intention of being the mother-in-law in the kitchen saying, \u2018My son doesn\u2019t like the stuffing that way, this is the way we make it in our family.\u2019 They will have their vision. They will have their plan. It\u2019s up to the caucus to decide which way they want to go.\u201d",

    "content": "The post How are Bitcoin Long-Term Holders Responding to the BTC Price Crash? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The Bitcoin price has continued to shrink in 2022 since Terra Luna initiated a significant crypto crash in Q1. The FTX and Alameda meltdown has stirred fresh selling pressure, which analysts expect to push through 2023. Moreover, confidence in centralized crypto exchanges has significantly slumped, which may push some to the insolvency route. According to our latest crypto price oracles, Bitcoin is trading around $16,500, up from the recent lows of $15,900. The digital asset is trading 76 percent down from its ATH, $69k, set approximately a year ago. Long-term Bitcoin critic Peter Schiff thinks Bitcoin price is yet to bottom per the current sentiments. Shiff highlighted a scenario where long-term Bitcoin holders sell their bags to sustain themselves\u2014adding that sooner than later, only long-term holders with sustainable paychecks will survive the shakeout. It didn't take long for this forecast to come true. The lion's share of the selling has not even started yet. #Bitcoin still has a long way to fall. https://t.co/dvNtGMIQHq\u2014 Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) November 17, 2022 Nonetheless, long-term Bitcoin holders are optimistic about the overall Btc market, which has significant adoption worldwide. Per on-chain data, long-term Bitcoin holders perceive the current bear market as similar to 2018 one. Glassnode explained: \u201cBitcoin Long-Term Holders are currently experiencing acute financial stress, holding an average of -33% in unrealized losses. This is comparable to the lows of the 2018 bear market, which saw a peak unrealized loss of -36% on average.\u201d Notably, Glassnode data shows that crypto exchanges recorded a sharp uptick in withdrawals toward non-custodial platforms. Reportedly, cryptocurrency exchanges have seen one of the most significant net declines in aggregate BTC balance in history, falling by 72.9k BTC in 7 days. Glassnode Further Notes on Bitcoin Market Outlook Bitcoin (BTC) is a legal tender to two countries -El Salvador and the African Central Republic \u2013 and is regulated as a digital asset in many other jurisdictions. With a hard cap of 21 million Bitcoins and a halving to reduce the overall supply over time, market strategists are optimistic about its long-term success.\u00a0 Nevertheless, global geopolitics and the prevailing macroeconomics continue to push Bitcoin prices to higher volatility. For instance, the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine has significantly divided international regulators on using Bitcoin and other crypto assets.\u00a0 Furthermore, western governments argue that Russia has used Bitcoin and other crypto assets to manoeuvre the set sanctions.\u00a0 However, with the rising global inflation rate, which has significantly reduced fiat currencies\u2019 purchasing power, Bitcoin and other digital assets are expected to record significant cash inflows.",

    "content": "The post Toon Finance DogeCoin Shiba Inu Coin Moon After Elon Musk Seals Twitter Purchase appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News In the past few months, there has been a great deal of discussion over so-called \u201cmeme coins\u201d like DOGE, of which Elon Musk claims to be a large admirer. Since his controversial purchase of Twitter, it has rocketed in popularity. What is a meme coin? A cryptocurrency that is based on or gets its inspiration from an online meme is called a meme coin. The most well-known example of a currency based on a meme is the DOGE, which was designed after the viral image of a Shiba Inu dog known as the \u201cDoge\u201d meme. Other examples of meme coins are UBQ and COIN, both of which are based on popular memes such as \u201cUbiquiti\u201d and \u201cBitcoin,\u201d respectively. The realm of virtual currencies is perpetually undergoing change, with new concepts and technology being presented on a consistent basis. The proliferation of meme coins is a relatively recent phenomenon in this sector.\u00a0 The Support of DOGEcoin by Elon Musk and What It Means for Investors in Cryptocurrencies Elon Musk, CEO of both Tesla and SpaceX, has been a prominent booster of DOGEcoin, which has led to a significant increase in the price of the cryptocurrency. It is possible that there is more to Musk\u2019s backing than meets the eye, despite the fact that some people assume he is just trying to capitalise on the current wave of excitement. In this article, we will discuss some of the reasons that Musk may have endorsed DOGEcoin, as well as what this support may represent for those who have invested in cryptocurrencies. There are a few different hypotheses to consider on the reasons why Elon Musk is such a vocal supporter of DOGEcoin. To begin, it is possible that he just really likes the coin, or that he has faith in its potential in the long run. Second, it is possible that he is trying to raise people\u2019s knowledge about cryptocurrencies in general and the potential that they have as an investment. The third possibility is that he is attempting to create a buzz in order to artificially inflate the price of DOGEcoin (and make a profit in the process). It is important to note that Musk is not the only celebrity to endorse DOGEcoin; other celebrities, such as Snoop Dogg and Gene Simmons, have also shown their support for the cryptocurrency. It is possible that the price of DOGEcoin is being driven even higher by the increased attention it is receiving from high-profile personalities. It is impossible to overlook Elon Musk\u2019s impact on the cryptocurrency market, regardless of whether you are an investor in cryptocurrencies or just someone who is inquisitive about the world of digital currencies. The price of the cryptocurrency has skyrocketed as a direct result of his public promotion of DOGEcoin.\u00a0 Some people assume that he is simply trying to capitalise on the buzz around the cryptocurrency; however, there may be more to his endorsement than meets the eye. The impact that Musk\u2019s continuous support will have on DOGEcoin and the cryptocurrency industry as a whole is something that can only be determined with the passage of time; nevertheless, one thing is certain: he is most certainly someone to keep an eye on. Toon Finance Decnetalized coins are beginning to attract media attention from all over the world as more and more celebrities from across the world enter the field of decentralised finance. Toon Finance is a brand new DEX platform that operates similarly to pancake swaps and will include support for the ERC20 blockchain. Toon Finance is a forward-thinking piece of software that has produced a sizable community of seasoned users, and anyone who is interested in joining the team can do so at no cost. Simply joining their Telegram channel and introducing yourself is all that is required of you at this point. Already having raised more than 2 million dollars in USD during the first week of their presale, Toon Finance is poised to become the Meme token of the year. After many months of planning and preparation, the long-delayed project can now be accessed by the general public. The following is a list of the distinguishing characteristics that set Toon Finance apart from other meme coins, such as Tamadoge and Shiba Inu: Uses the DEX Operating System as its base. The primary feature of the Toon Finance Protocol is that it is a decentralized exchange (DEX) platform. This is a unique characteristic because other meme coins on the market operate on centralized platforms. Toon Finance operates on the DEX to offer investors more security and peace of mind. One of the biggest advantages of the DEX system is that it does not have a central failure point that hackers can attack to harm the users. This is why investors can rest assured that their finances are safer. Another advantage of DEX is that it eliminates the need for a third party to act as a middleman in the transactions.

    "content": "ConsenSys, in collaboration with several crypto companies, is co-launching a climate platform for the world built on the Ethereum PoS consensus protocol. Regulatory authorities have constantly expressed their worries over the effects of crypto mining on the environment. The Ethereum-based software firm, ConsenSys, which played a crucial role in the completion of the much-publicized Merge, has teamed up with many other crypto firms to co-launch the Ethereum Climate Platform (ECP) during the ongoing global climate conference, dubbed COP27. The COP27 is a United Nations Climate Change Global Innovation Hub in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, from November 6\u201318. The climate platform is developed for the Ethereum network and aims to reduce the ecosystem\u2019s excess energy demand, which was the norm before the Merge two months ago. According to Joseph Lubin, co-founder of ConsenSys and a developer of the Ethereum blockchain, the motive is to raise some capital and invest it in high-impact technologies. Lubin stated that the team is expected to find funding for new projects that have technological significance and determine how impactful they will become. Upon the completion of the Merge, Ethereum discontinued its use of the energy-intensive proof-of-work (PoW) to the more energy-efficient proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus protocol. Ethereum, during the PoW stage, was powered by miners who completed several challenging puzzles to add more transactions to the ledger. With the PoS, Ethereum utilizes validators to facilitate transactions on the blockchain while using less energy. After the Merge, the network has drastically reduced its energy use by 99.9%. Part of Lubin\u2019s statement read: \u201cThe Ethereum Merge has raised the bar for reducing climate change across the broader sectors of the global economy. It shows that with a collective drive, technological innovations are possible without increasing carbon emissions.\u201d Rising Concerns about Crypto Mining Even before Ethereum\u2019s transition from the PoW to the PoS, digital asset mining has been the subject of increasing backlash from regulators and environmental activists. Accordingly, the European Commission revealed in October that it plans to ban crypto mining if the region faces a severe energy crisis in the coming winter. As expected, regulatory agencies like the European Union (EU) are proposing ways to reduce PoW activities within the bloc. In October, the European Commission told its member states to be ready to stop crypto mining. In addition, the commission proposes load shedding in the region\u2019s electricity supply as winter approaches. China has since taken a more extreme stance by banning Bitcoin mining and other crypto trading activities in 2021. Other PoW protocols, like Dogecoin and Zcash, also consider switching to PoS due to energy concerns. Ethereum has experienced a significant surge in its price after the Merge, with the network seeing close to a 10% increase. However, the gains were short-lived as ETH could not continue its upward trend 24 hours after the historic transition. ETH currently trades at $1,214 at the time of writing, per our data. However, the token is yet to respond to the latest development as the community hopes for a price increase towards the $2,000 level before the year ends.

    "description": "<p>The United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has publicly censured Mohammad Prodhan, the former Chief Executive Officer of Sonali Bank UK (SBUK), for failing to establish and maintain effective anti-money laundering (AML) systems and controls at the bank. </p><p>The financial markets regulator, which <a href=\"https://www.financemagnates.com/institutional-forex/regulation/sonali-bank-uk-ceo-fined-76400-for-money-laundering/\">fined Prodhan \u00a376,400 in 2018</a>, is now opting to several disapprove the ex-CEO as a result of \u201cexceptional circumstances in this case.\u201d</p><p>These situations include \"Mr Prodhan returning to Bangladesh and no longer having income or assets in the UK; the fact he is no longer in employment in Bangladesh; ongoing personal conditions which limit his ability to travel to the UK for the Upper Tribunal; and the length of time since his misconduct which has been impacted by Covid-delays to the litigation,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.financemagnates.com/tag/financial-conduct-authority/\" target=\"_blank\">FCA</a> explained in a statement <a href=\"https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/fca-issues-final-notice-former-ceo-anti-money-laundering-failings\">released</a> on Friday.</p><p>Furthermore, the financial watchdog noted the Bank of England\u2019s Prudential Regulation Authority has canceled the bank\u2019s authorization. The institution has also been renamed to Sonali Bangladesh (UK) Limited, it said. </p><p>SBUK was founded in 2001 to serve the Bangladeshi community in the United Kingdom. The bank is the product of a partnership between the Bangladesh government and Sonali Bank, a state-owned commercial bank in Bangladesh.</p><p>Prodhan's Offence</p><p>In 2018, the FCA penalized Prodhan for failing to take charge of his AML duties at the SBUK, leading to \u201csystemic failures in SBUK\u2019s AML systems and controls throughout the business.\u201d However, the CEO referred the case to the Upper Tribunal, a UK superior appellate court, where the case was delayed. </p><p>\u201cWhile a financial penalty was appropriate in this case, prolonged litigation to enforce a penalty that is unlikely to be paid against a person who may not be able to travel to the UK to explain himself in person to the Upper Tribunal is neither practical nor fair,\" noted Mark Steward, Executive Director of Enforcement and Market Oversight at the FCA. \"In these exceptional circumstances, a public censure is an appropriate resolution of the case,\u201d Steward added.</p><p>Meanwhile, in 2016, <a href=\"https://www.financemagnates.com/tag/bangladesh/\">Bangladesh</a> appointed Pradhan as the Managing Director of Rupali Bank, a state-owned commercial bank. In 2019, the executive was also selected as the MD of Sonali Bank in Bangladesh. However, FCA in the latest statement said Prodhan is no longer in employment in Bangladesh.</p> This article was written by Solomon Oladipupo at www.financemagnates.com.",

    "content": "Dennis Rodman is one of the raunchiest men in NBA history, but even his experiences didn\u2019t work all the time. Especially not the nights before NBA games. The Bulls legend made a name in the NBA for various reasons. He was notably known as the rebounding king of his time. It\u2019s why he earned the nickname, \u2018The Worm.\u2019 His tough brand of defense and hustle stemmed from his time with the Detroit Pistons, known as the \u2018Bad Boy Pistons.\u2019 He helped the Bulls win three straight championships from 1995 to 1998 after Jordan recruited him. Jordan regularly played the Pistons during their peak, so he knew exactly what he would be getting with Rodman on the team. The Pistons routinely harassed Jordan to the point where they coined the \u2018Jordan rules\u2019, a physical style of play meant to neutralize the greatest player in NBA history. \u201cThe Last Dance\u201d turned to Dennis Rodman, the \u201cBad Boys\u201d Pistons of the late 1980s, the Jordan Rules and the continued turbulence early in the 1997-98 Bulls\u2019 campaign.https://t.co/TJcC04CAYr \u2014 Sun-Times Sports (@suntimes_sports) April 27, 2020 Also Read: \u201cLeBron James just mocked his own LeLiar personality\u201d: Lakers star makes fun of his pathological lying while discussing LeRoy Butler\u2019s Lambeau Leap Dennis Rodman discussed how scandalous experiments before games never worked for him Rodman\u2019s career is defined more by his adventures outside the court than those on it, however. He was a wild man. Rodman loved partying, and he loved to have fun with women. However, for all his crazy stories, Rodman found his breaking point. Even the legendary Rodman had his limits. It was surprising for him, but in the end, he did come to a decision. He was talking to Mike Tyson on his show \u2018Hotboxin\u2019, when he said, \u201cI\u2019ve done this twice in my life playing sports and I never knew that this s**t will f**k with you when you\u2019re playing the game.\u201d What exactly was he referring to? \u201cI\u2019m trying to have s*x all night before the game. Doesn\u2019t f****ng work out too well.\u201d The routine affected his gameplay and his coach even had to talk to him to sort out the issues. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you take a night off? I know what you did last night. You got weak knees right?\u201d Rodman recalled his coach saying. Rodman married himself and earned a cool $10 million Dennis Rodman is a generally wild character, but there are some lengths he\u2019ll go to that will amaze people. Once he even married himself, and the entire stunt netted him a massive profit. Dennis Rodman has a net worth of $500,000 right now, and he once tried to increase that immensely. In 1996, Rodman appeared at his book signing for \u2018Bad as I wanna be\u2019 in a bridal gown and a horse-drawn carriage. The whole thing was done to promote his book, and it worked. The book was a bestseller for several months, and in the end Rodman revealed that he earned $10 million from the entire thing. What a way to earn money, but of course, it\u2019s only Rodman who could do something like this.

    "content": "The post Top 5 Altcoins Which May Undergo a 10x Rally in 2023! appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin price appears to be in hot waters right now as it has lost a significant amount of investor base and also the trust. The resulting volatility has compelled the investors to move out of the platform, which has caused a significant financial loss in recent times. Hence, market participants are now hunting for potential altcoins that may undergo a 10x rally. Below mentioned are the potential altcoins for 2023: Ethereum Ethereum is the second largest asset after Bitcoin, sharing a significant market cap with the crypto space. With the launch of ETH 2.0, the asset displayed enough strength to remain above the crucial support zones in times of bear markets. However, the current market conditions have driven the ETH price down, but with a slight change in the bearish market sentiments, the price may rebound nicely to revive the bullish trend. XRP XRP price had begun to gain traction within the market as the analysts and the influencers believed the crypto\u2019s victory against the SEC could be imminent. Moreover, the asset\u2019s value has been extensively bearish or stagnant for a prolonged period and hence is believed to rebound well when the lawsuit settles down. Therefore, the year 2023 could bring decent returns for the asset that may trigger many other cryptos. Binance Coin Binance Coin is the third largest cryptocurrency after Bitcoin & Ethereum, excluding stablecoins, which have maintained a decent rally from the beginning. The asset rose to new heights without any noise and currently manifests huge strength. Therefore, the BNB price is assumed to rise significantly in the coming days and lay down a firm upswing since the beginning of 2023. Dogecoin Dogecoin, despite losing a huge user base due to the unfamous market crash in 2021, maintained its dominance. Hence is trading within the top 10 cryptos according to the market capitalization. The asset is believed to rebound finely as the market conditions stabalize and quickly reclaim the lost levels. In 2023, the DOGE price is expected to maintain a significant upswing and rise higher. Polygon Polygon\u2019s price has been incremental despite the bearish market sentiments and displays enough strength. The price presently appears to be strong and may resume with a firm upswing in the coming days. Once the MATIC price settles above $1, it may be easy for the asset to maintain a notable upswing in the coming days.",

    "content": "The post Big Eyes Coin Falls Short Toon Finance Slaughters ICO Presale Stage One 2.75 MIL appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News ICO Presale Fun Toonie Takeover It has been an extremely busy year in the world of cryptocurrency. Over 300 million people now trade cryptocurrencies while daily transactions now easily surpass the $100bn mark. Unsurprisingly, a glut of new digital tokens has entered the market, taking the total number of unique cryptocurrencies to over 20,000 and counting in 2022. However, some perform better than others. While investors in any environment would gladly take a slice of good fortune, the digital assets that perform well are not determined by luck alone. Far from it. Right now, Big Eyes Coin is at real risk of being one of the year\u2019s big losers while Toon Finance has emerged as one of the top assets to hold in 2023. Here\u2019s why. Big Eyes Coin falls short Toon Finance leads With its cute kitty-based token, Big Eyes launched its pre-sale phase with high hopes of matching the success of DogeCoin and other popular meme coins but with almost instant results at launch. While the platform has yet to officially launch its BIG coin, signs of potential shortcomings have already emerged. At a glance, Big Eyes is doing fine. With 3589.74 BIG tokens equating to $1, the company has successfully raised over $9.7m of its $10,700,000.00 presale ICO target. Meanwhile, the token can be purchased through USD payments or popular digital currencies like ETH and BNB. Confirmation that it will be available on Uniswap is another positive development. Big Eyes is a DeFi economy that is powered by the Ethereum blockchain and delivers safe, fast, and decentralized transactions in an accessible, user-friendly, and innovative fashion. On the act of things, the opportunity to embrace a cute meme coin from launch stands out as an ideal introduction to crypto investments for new investors as well as a low-risk portfolio booster for experienced investors. However, when you scratch beneath the surface, Big Eyes Coin has already underperformed by failing to sell out its pre-sale allocation while even its $250 competition has yet to transform the fortunes of the token.\u00a0 Big Eyes has brought some intrigue to the industry while the fluffy, cartoon images are equally as impressive as those used by the dog-related meme coins. However, a difficult year for DOGE and Shiba Inu \u2013 which has fallen from $0.000079 in late October 2021 to under $0.00001 \u2013 will undoubtedly cause concern regarding the long-term prospects of any meme coin. The market is recovering from the crash but global economic difficulties will inevitably cause hesitation from investors when it comes to acting purely on speculation. In a world where information is available at our fingertips, people rightly want to scrutinize investments to validate their choices. Furthermore, many analysts predict that a repeat of those exponential bull runs of 2021 simply cannot be repeated by coins that rely on novelty alone.\u00a0 Ultimately, the potential of Big Eyes to spark some interest is clear, but the big question is \u201cthen what?\u201d. The answer is, sadly, \u201cnothing\u201d. Aside from the fact that investments will contribute to the platform\u2019s 5% charity donation, the BIG token is just a fun digital asset with no real purpose. There lies the problem. Toon Finance is set to combine novelty with function The ability of meme coins to attract investors and take crypto into the public consciousness has been a driving force in the new era of cryptocurrency investments. While the ship for novelty alone may have passed \u2013 especially when looking at the forecasts for BIG before it has even launched \u2013 it has shown the demand for accessibility as the appeal of investments continues to expand beyond blockchain supporters to a wide range of demographics. Another upcoming token currency in its pre-sale phase is Toon Finance. And by combining the novelty aspects with genuine long-term function, it looks set to enjoy a phenomenal 2023 with many analysts forecasting a major bull run shortly after its official launch on January, 1. Having only launched its pre-sale phase in the second week of October, Toon Finance has sold an impressive $2.75m worth of its native TFI coin. Moreover, its ICO has been included on CoinMarketCap, Crypto.com, and KuCoin. Interest in the digital token is further highlighted by the fact that it has become the most searched-for asset on CoinMarketCap. The fun cartoon mascots certainly capture the attention but the early success and long-term prospects of Toon Fi is primarily attributed to its function within the context of the Toon Finance metaverse. The P2E platform is geared towards gamers with the Space Battle Grounds arena allowing players to compete against other members of the growing community through a range of games. Lotteries and other fun initiatives ensure that the digital space will be a truly immersive experience for members. Toon Finance is technically a meme coin as it was named after a meme. However, the platform has a serious application and is about far more than its native token, but its success will surely open the door to significant growth. Having already outperformed Big Cat and TAMAdodge, which also had a positive start before losing some momentum, TFI is the hottest token due for an imminent release. New digital assets are the way to go in 2023 After a difficult 2022 for the crypto industry \u2013 as well as real-world investments \u2013 2023 promises to be far more pleasing. Embracing ICOs and early launch investments could signal the perfect opportunity for investors to reach their short and long-term financial objectives. Not least because there is a chance to build a diverse portfolio thanks to the low purchase prices involved.\u00a0 The landscape is changing as the top new digital tokens will combine the best features of meme coins with those of utility coins to provide genuine function. Whether ToonFi or other new tokens can emulate the boom of 2021 remains to be seen, but it is clear that there is a potential for huge ROIs. After seeing how quickly things can change, though, early investments will be the key to maximized returns. Once a prime candidate has been found, now is the time to join the party. The ICO Presale \u2013 What is it and should you participate? An ICO presale is a period of time before the main ICO event when a project sells tokens to strategic investors at a discounted price. This is usually done in order to raise funds to finance the main ICO event. If you\u2019re thinking of participating in an ICO presale, there are a few things you should know. In this blog post, we\u2019ll cover what an ICO presale is, how it works, and whether or not you should participate in one.\u00a0 What is an ICO Presale?\u00a0 An ICO presale (also sometimes called a private sale or pre-ICO) is a period of time before the main ICO event when a project sells tokens to strategic investors at a discounted price. This is usually done in order to raise funds to finance the main ICO event.\u00a0 During an ICO presale, a project will offer tokens at a significantly lower price than they will during the main ICO event. For example, if the main ICO event price for 1 token is $1, the project might offer tokens during the presale at $0.50 each. The aim of this is to attract larger investors who are willing to commit more money upfront in exchange for a discount.\u00a0 It\u2019s important to note that not all projects hold an ICO presale \u2013 some only have a main ICO event. And not all projects that do have an ICO presale make it open to the public. In some cases, the presale may be invitation-only and only available to accredited investors.\u00a0 How Does an ICO Presale Work?\u00a0 If you\u2019re interested in participating in an ICO presale, there are usually two ways you can go about it. The first is through an exchange and the second is directly through the project\u2019s website.\u00a0 If you choose to participate through an exchange, you\u2019ll need to create an account and deposit funds into it. Once you\u2019ve done that, you\u2019ll be able to buy tokens during the ICO presale at the specified price.\u00a0 Should You Participate in anICO Presale? Whether or not you should participate in anICO presale depends on a few factors. Firstly, do your research on the project and make sure you believe in its long-term viability. Secondly, consider whether or not you\u2019re comfortable with taking on more risk \u2013 remember that as with any investment, there\u2019s always a chance you could lose your money entirely. And finally, make sure you understand how much money you\u2019re willing to invest and stick to that budget \u2013 don\u2019t get caught up in FOMO (fear of missing out) and end up investing more than you can afford to lose!\u00a0 Toon Finance / TFT Twitter / Toon Finance Telegram Disclaimer: This is a press release post.

    "content": "The post Bitcoin (BTC) Price Stuck in Rut: Here\u2019s What Traders Can Expect This Weekend appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The bankruptcy filing by the crypto exchange giant FTX has created a black hole in the crypto space as the market has lost billions of dollars due to the FTX crash. However, it may mark the birth of a fresh bullish start for the crypto market by Q1 of 2023 as it sets a new goal for leading assets to bounce back to unexpected price levels. As the macro conditions of the traditional market improve, Bitcoin tends to fade its bottom levels by skyrocketing to a bullish territory.\u00a0 Bitcoin To Ignore Its Consolidated Zone Soon! The crypto sector, which once promised the community and investors decentralization and trust, now has turned out to be a joke, ending up with authoritarianism after FTX\u2019s demise. However, Bitcoin seems to continue its legacy and lead the market to the North as it aims to initiate an upward rally by next week. Trading View A well-known crypto analyst, Matthew Dixon, the CEO of Evai, predicts that Bitcoin may extend its current consolidation trend for the next few days. According to him, Bitcoin may break its ongoing consolidated price range if it exceeds the price level of $17K. He further predicts that BTC may form an upward triangle pattern in the price chart with two tops between the price range of $17.6K and $17.4K. Bitcoin may project itself with a smooth run to $19.5K if it surpasses its resistance at $17.6K by the next week. What Lies Ahead For Bitcoin? The FTX\u2019s downfall is similar to previous bearish events like Mt Gox in 2014, and it may raise concerns about centralization and centralized exchanges. Hence, Bitcoin has a high chance of standing out as it works in a decentralized nature, forcing users to trust self-custodian wallets rather than centralized exchanges. Looking at the daily price chart, the Bitcoin market has reached a short-term consolidation range as the BTC price has been hovering around the $16K-$17K range from the last week. Bitcoin currently trades at $16.5K after it faced rejection again at $17K today.\u00a0 The RSI-14 indicator has no sign of improvement as it continues to trend in an overselling zone of the 36-level. However, the MACD line seems to change its mood as it starts trading parallelly with the current trend without dropping further below its signal line. Bitcoin price is currently building a short-term momentum which may test an immediate support level at $16,350. If BTC fails to hold its price near $16K, it can soon aim for a breakout below its 23.6% Fib retracement, plunging hard to $14.5K. However, an upward retracement is expected if BTC makes a bullish reversal after testing the $16,350 support level. A breakout above its Bollinger band\u2019s upper limit, which is near the EMA-20 trend line at $17.9K, may spark fresh surges in the price chart, and Bitcoin can next make an attempt to break its strong resistance at $20K.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0",

    "description": "The decision to freeze Shin\u2019s asset worth over $104 million was approved by the Seoul Southern District Court, which was based on a request from the prosecutors.",
    "content": "While crypto exchange FTX stole the limelight from other fallen ecosystems, South Korean authorities continue their efforts to bring closure to the victims of the year\u2019s first crypto crash \u2014 Terraform Labs. Nearly six months after the Terra (LUNA) blockchain was officially halted , South Korean authorities froze approximately $104.4 million (140 billion won) from co-founder Shin Hyun-seong based on suspicion of unfair profits. The decision to freeze Shin\u2019s asset worth over $104 million was approved by the Seoul Southern District Court, which was based on a request from the prosecutors. The claim related to Shin\u2019s involvement in selling pre-issued Terra ( LUNA ) tokens to unwary investors. Based on suspicion of profiting from unwarranted LUNA sales, the district court froze the allegedly stolen funds until further investigations are underway, reported local news media YTN. \u201cReports that CEO Shin Hyun-seong sold Luna at a high point and realized profits or that he made profits through other illegal methods are not true,\u201d Cointelegraph previously quoted Shin\u2019s attorney . The preindictment preservation of the funds is a way of preventing bad actors from disposing of stolen funds and causing more financial damage or losses for the investors. Shin is currently being investigated by South Korean authorities on two charges \u2014 making unfair profits from issuing in-house tokens LUNA and TerraUSD (UST) and leaking customer transaction information of Chai \u2014 a Korean payment app linked to Terra \u2014 to Terraform Labs. On November 14, the South Korean prosecutors requested the accused co-founder appear in court as part of an investigation into the firm's collapse. Related: Terra Labs, Luna Guard commission audit to defend against allegations of misusing funds In the first week of November, the prosecutors accused Terra co-founder Do Kwon of manipulating Terra\u2019s price. \"It's highly disappointing to see the Korean prosecutors continue to try to contort the Capital Markets Act to fit their agenda and push baseless claims. Prior judicial decisions and statements by the Korean financial authorities, including the FSC, establish that cryptocurrency tokens are not investment contract securities,\" said Terraform Labs spokesperson in a written statement to Cointelegraph.",

Recently, the exchange was reportedly \u201chacked\u201d and more than $600 million in funds were squeezed out. Meanwhile, many believed it was the job of an insider as the stolen funds were quickly converted into Ethereum & stablecoins. In a fresh update, SBF has reportedly received a portion of $420 million in funds into his personal account. FTX raised $420 million in funding in October last year to improve the user experience and be more in line with regulators. Interestingly, nearly 75% of the total amount was sent to SBF. The October 2021 funding round valued FTX exchange at $25 billion and raised money from investors like BlackRock, Tiger Global, and Singapore\u2019s sovereign wealth fund Temasek & Sequoia Capital. Later, after a couple of months, some of these investors helped raise $400 million for FTX\u2019s subsidiary at an $8 billion valuation. During the time funds were raised, the crypto markets were booming and the Alameda was highly profitable. While it is still unclear what SBF did with the $300 million, whether it was poured back to FTX or kept separate, Meanwhile, FTX\u2019s 2021 audited financial statements said the money was being reserved by the company for \u2018operational expediency\u2019 on behalf of the related party.",

On November 11, the platform filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.

Sullivan & Cromwell, a Wall Street law firm, has been hired by FTX as outside legal assistance in bankruptcy proceedings and criminal investigations.\u00a0 The exchange contacted the legal firm as its liquidity problem grew \u201cincreasingly grave,\u201d according to court documents. According to FTX and its extensive network of affiliated businesses, which includes trading firm Alameda Research, its assets and liabilities are between $10 billion and $50 billion.\u00a0 Bankman-Fried\u2019s assets, which were previously valued at $16 billion, have been destroyed.\u00a0 A class action lawsuit against Bankman-Fried and numerous famous exchange promoters was also filed on Thursday, accusing them of engaging in fraud against \u201cunsophisticated investors.\u201d\u00a0 On behalf of investors, the Moskowitz Law Firm and Boies Schiller filed a case alleging that Bankman-Fried violated U.S. securities laws and caused approximately $11 billion in damages.

    "description": "Amid its ongoing battle with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Ripple has announced that it is seeking to expand its presence in the European Union (EU). In an interview with CNBC earlier this week, Stuart Alderoty, General Counsel for Ripple, said that \u201ceffectively, Ripple is operating outside of the U.S.\u201d as it stands due to its ongoing legal woes with the SEC. He added: Essentially, its customers and its revenue are all driven outside of the U.S., even though we still have a lot of employees inside of the U.S. Whilst it patiently awaits the outcome of its lawsuit, Ripple is planning to expand its presence in Europe. The firm already has two employees working on the ground in the Republic of Ireland and is seeking a virtual asset service provider (VASP) license from the Irish Central Bank so that it can \u201cpassport\u201d its offerings throughout the EU via an entity based there. The company also plans to file an application for an electronic money license in the country \u201cshortly.\u201d Alderoty said that he expects a ruling on the case against Ripple which has been going on since 2020 very soon, adding that \u201cwe are at the beginning of the end of the process in our case.\u201d. The SEC filed a lawsuit against the company alleging that the firm and its executives illegally sold XRP tokens, a cryptocurrency created in 2012 by the firm\u2019s founders, to investors without first registering the token as a security. The company denies claims that XRP is a security, arguing that the token should not be considered an investment contract and is used in its business to facilitate cross-border transactions between banks and financial institutions. Ripple Plans to Expand in Anticipation of MiCA Ripple\u2019s plans to expand into the EU are driven by anticipation of the zone\u2019s Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulations coming into effect within a few years. The regulatory framework was passed by EU lawmakers earlier in the year and seeks to align rules regarding crypto assets across the region. Beyond the EU, Ripple has also made the United Kingdom a priority by releasing a white paper with a set of guidelines outlining how it thinks Britain should regulate cryptocurrencies.

    "description": "FIFA president Gianni Infantino lashed out at Western critics of the Qatar World Cup\u2014sparking more controversy on the eve of the event",
    "content": "On the eve of signature sporting events, athletic administrators often address the media, as a sort of \u201cstate-of-the-union\u201d affair to address a league\u2019s accomplishments and concerns. Before the Super Bowl and NBA Finals, for example, commissioners of the NFL and NBA speak to the press, take some questions from reporters, and either offer direct answers or spin as they see fit. It\u2019s an almost ceremonial exercise. The goal: mollify the media before everyone moves onto the big games. On Saturday in Doha, FIFA president Gianni Infantino offered a new twist on this ritual. Instead of ushering in the Qatar World Cup, which begins on Sunday, Infantino gave an extraordinary speech, full of grievances about media examinations of the host country\u2019s human rights record, whataboutism, and what can best be described as an awkward attempt to compare his personal backstory to disenfranchised populations across the globe. (At worst, his remarks were highly offensive). [time-brightcove not-tgx=\u201dtrue\u201d] Infantino badly conflated examination with provocation. CNN labeled the speech an \u201cexplosive tirade.\u201d If anything, the immediate negative response to Infantino\u2019s press conference shined further light on the problems surrounding this 2022 World Cup, and undercut his own plea to keep the focus on football, to stick to sports. Infantino scored a spectacular own-goal for his own World Cup. Near the beginning of his sprawling hour-long address, Infantino said, \u201cToday I feel Qatari. Today I feel Arabic. Today I feel African. Today I feel gay. Today I feel disabled. Today I feel (like) a migrant worker. \u201cOf course I am not Qatari, I am not an Arab, I am not African, I am not gay, I am not disabled. But I feel like it, because I know what it means to be discriminated, to be bullied, as a foreigner in a foreign country. As a child I was bullied \u2013 because I had red hair and freckles, plus I was Italian so imagine.\u201d Infantino grew up in Switzerland. He said he feels like a migrant worker. Infantino made a $3.2 million in 2019. \u201cWhat do you do then?\u201d Infantino said. \u201cYou try to engage, make friends. Don\u2019t start accusing, fighting, insulting, you start engaging. And this is what we should be doing.\u201d (READ MORE: Meet The 22-Year-Old Star Who Could Make Team USA A World Cup Contender) Summoning the familiar whatabout deflection to which we\u2019ve become all too accustomed in political discourse, Infantino suggested that Western countries were in no position to criticize Qatar, given the human rights shortcomings in Europe and elsewhere. \u201cWe have told many, many lessons from some Europeans, from the western world,\u201d Infantino said. \u201cI think for what we Europeans have been doing the last 3,000 years we should be apologizing for next 3,000 years before starting to give moral lessons to people.\u201d True, every nation is far from perfect. But Infantino seemed to forget that he leads an organization that was embroiled in a bribery scandal when it awarded the World Cup to Qatar in 2010. (Though Infantino was not head of FIFA at the time). That thousands of migrant workers have died in Qatar over the past decade, many because of poor working conditions made more perilous by excessive heat. That FIFA made a conscious decision to hold a World Cup in Qatar. Questions are more than fair game. For Infantino to suggest criticism of Qatar is \u201cjust hypocrisy\u201d could not be more hypocritical. Infantino also looked to the disabled population to make his case for media hypocrisy. \u201cI was at an event a few days ago when we explained what we\u2019re doing at this World Cup for disabled people,\u201d Infantino said. He noted that there were around 400 journalists at his press conference on Saturday, but just four at that event. \u2018There [are] one billion disabled people in the world,\u201d he said. \u201cOne billion disabled people. Nobody cares.\u201d Infantino summoned some self-pity for FIFA, an organization that has earned none. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy, everyday and everyday to read all these critics,\u201d he said. He also lectured the press on how they should do their job going forward. \u201cIf you need to criticize somebody, don\u2019t criticize the players,\u201d Infantino said. \u201cDon\u2019t put pressure on the players, don\u2019t put pressure on the coaches. Let them concentrate on making their fans happy.\u201d His words were met with swift condemnation. Nicholas McGeehan, director of FairSquare, a non-profit human rights organization, called Infantino\u2019s speech \u201ccrass.\u201d \u201cIn brushing aside legitimate human rights criticisms, Gianni Infantino is dismissing the enormous price paid by migrant workers to make his flagship tournament possible \u2013 as well as FIFA\u2019s responsibility for it,\u201d Steve Cockburn, Amnesty International\u2019s Head of Economic and Social Justice, said in a statement. \u201cDemands for equality, dignity and compensation cannot be treated as some sort of culture war \u2013 they are universal human rights that FIFA has committed to respect in its own statutes.\u201d Infantino did announce that FIFA would start a legacy fund to follow this World Cup. \u201cThis cannot be mere window dressing, however,\u201d said Cockburn. \u201cIf FIFA is to salvage anything from this tournament, it must announce that it will invest a significant part of the $6 billion the organization will make from this tournament and make sure this fund is used to compensate workers and their families directly.\u201d Let\u2019s hope Infantino\u2019s actions after the World Cup rank better than his performance before it.

    "content": "The post PancakeSwap Will List ORY In December \u2013 Is Oryen Listing On WazirX, Binance, Or KuCoin After Its Presale? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Many cryptocurrency projects have recently struggled to raise prices to more desirable levels. However, Oryen (ORY), a new cryptocurrency with an ongoing presale, is breaking the trend. The project has commenced phase four of the presale with new records of 120% returns for early investors. At this rate, Oryen might become one of the market\u2019s top cryptocurrencies once it lists on PancakeSwap, WazirX, Binance, and KuCoin, as rumored after the presale phase. Oryen (ORY) Oryen, the most intriguing cryptocurrency project on Binance Smart Chain, is currently in presale. Investing in this project allows token holders to get the most steady passive income. A fixed annual percentage yield (APY) of 90% is offered by Oryen, which is higher than the APYs of other staking protocols and remains constant regardless of market conditions. Oryen aims to automate and simplify staking while providing its users with high yields. Thus, it uses the Oryen Autostaking Technic (OAT), which enables immediate and secure auto-staking. Holders of ORY have nothing else to do than wait for their hourly rewards to land directly into their wallets. In addition, the project uses Risk-Free Value (RFV), a separate wallet that ensures the stability of the ORY price. It has a reserve to support and maintain constant reward payouts during challenging market periods. PancakeSwap PancakeSwap is one of the biggest decentralized exchanges and a household name on the Binance Smart Chain. It will be Oryen\u2019s first step to list on the DEX on the 30th of December before it potentially lists on any centralized exchange afterward. WazirX (WRX) WazirX is the largest and fastest-growing cryptocurrency exchange in India. Under the umbrella of Binance, it offers INR trading pairs for more than 200 crypto assets. Reportedly, Oryen\u2019s team is currently approaching the exchange in anticipation of its launch in late December. This move would open ORY to a vast market of more than 100 million Indian investors. The Bottom Line Oryen is surpassing investors\u2019 expectations with an astonishing 120% price increase since the presale started. Moreover, the rumored exchange listings might give the staking platform the powder it needs to enter the realm of the top 100 cryptocurrencies.

    "description": "Naomi Biden and Neal exchanged \u201cI do's\u201d during a nippy late-morning ceremony",
    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Joe Biden \u2018s granddaughter Naomi Biden and her fiance, Peter Neal, were married Saturday in just the 19th wedding in the history of the White House. Naomi Biden and Neal exchanged \u201cI do\u2019s\u201d during a nippy late-morning ceremony \u2014 temperatures were in the low 40s \u2014 on the South Lawn, which was turned into a wedding venue for the very first time. It\u2019s the first White House wedding with a president\u2019s granddaughter as the bride. Scores of white folding chairs dotted a portion of the South Lawn, and the South Portico of the White House, facing the lawn and the Washington Monument in the distance, was decorated with wreaths and garland bearing white flowers. There was no tent. Guests began arriving hours before the ceremony, with some women opting for open-toed shoes despite the chill. [time-brightcove not-tgx=\u201dtrue\u201d] The public is seeing none of the festivities, unlike some past White House weddings. The bride and groom decided to keep journalists out, although the ceremony was outdoors on the grounds of what the president and first lady call the \u201cpeople\u2019s house.\u201d Naomi Biden, 28, is a lawyer in Washington. Her parents are Hunter Biden, the son of the president and first lady Jill Biden, and Kathleen Buhle, Hunter\u2019s first wife. Neal, 25, of Jackson Hole, Wyoming, recently graduated from the University of Pennsylvania law school. He works at Georgetown University Law Center in Washington. His parents are Drs. Mary C. and William \u201cBill\u201d C. Neal of Jackson Hole. The couple, who have been living at the White House, was set up by a mutual friend about four years ago in New York City and have been together ever since, the White House said. Neal proposed in September 2021 near his childhood home in Jackson Hole with a ring that repurposed the band of his grandmother\u2019s engagement ring, according to the White House. After the 20-somethings officially became husband and wife, their families and the wedding party were getting out of the cold and heading back inside the White House for lunch, which is to be followed in the evening by a dessert-and-dancing reception, according to a person familiar with the planning who was not authorized to publicly discuss the wedding schedule. Few other details were released before the ceremony. To accommodate public interest, the president and first lady planned to issue a statement and release photos after the first of their six grandchildren tied the knot, the White House said. President Biden and the first lady were among those who attended the wedding rehearsal dinner Friday at the Renwick Gallery steps from the White House. Neal\u2019s parents hosted. The Biden family will pay for all wedding activities, White House officials have said. \u201cThe wedding of Naomi Biden and Peter is a private one,\u201d Karine Jean-Pierre, the president\u2019s chief spokesperson, said Friday. \u201cIt\u2019s a family event and Naomi and Peter have asked that their wedding be closed to the media and we are respecting their wishes.\u201d There have been 18 documented weddings in the 200-plus-year history of the White House. Nine involved a president\u2019s daughter, most recently Richard Nixon\u2019s daughter Tricia in 1971 and Lyndon Johnson\u2019s daughter Lynda in 1967. But nieces, a grandniece, a son and first ladies\u2019 siblings have also gotten married there. One president, Grover Cleveland, tied the knot at the White House, too, while in office. Some of the weddings were open to coverage by the news media, while others weren\u2019t at all. Journalists were allowed into Tricia Nixon\u2019s wedding to Ed Cox, the first wedding held in the Rose Garden. Her wedding planner \u2014 a three-ring black binder in the offices of the White House Historical Association \u2014 includes extensive notes on the media plan. But the May 1994 wedding of a brother of then-first lady Hillary Clinton and the daughter of then-U.S. Sen. Barbara Boxer \u2014 the first since Tricia Nixon\u2019s marriage \u2014 was closed to the press. Clinton\u2019s spokesperson commented afterward and the White House released a photo. It was the same for the October 2013 wedding of Pete Souza, President Barack Obama\u2019s official photographer, and his longtime partner, Patti Lease. The White House announced the wedding in a statement following the small, private wedding in the Rose Garden. The White House Correspondents Association, which advocates for press access to the White House and the president, said it was \u201cdeeply disappointed\u201d that the White House declined its request for press coverage of Naomi Biden\u2019s wedding. \u201cWhite House weddings have been covered by the press throughout history and the first family\u2019s wish for privacy must be balanced against the public\u2019s interest in an event occurring at the People\u2019s House with the president as a participant,\u201d the WHCA board said in a statement. Stewart McLaurin, president of the White House Historical Association, said it\u2019s important to remember that first families are families first and foremost. \u201cTheir privacy should be respected, their wishes should be respected,\u201d he said. The wedding is just one half of a big weekend for the Biden family. The president\u2019s 80th birthday is Sunday and family members in town will celebrate him at a brunch hosted by the first lady.",

The current Princess of Wales chatted with several families who had to flee their homeland following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. </p> <p>Body language expert Darren Stanton analyzed footage from Kate\u2019s visit and said she displayed several \u201csubmissive\u201d gestures which indicated that she had a genuine interest in being there and supporting the Ukrainian families. </p> <p>Speaking on behalf of <a href=\"http://www.slingo.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Slingo</a>, Stanton observed: \u201cWe saw Kate interacting with children by sitting at the table where they were coloring in leaning forward and lowering her height in a submissive gesture. It\u2019s designed to build rapport with children because when someone is at their height they\u2019re more inclined to think \u2018this is someone like me\u2019 as opposed to someone standing over them. </p> <p>\u201cShe also unconsciously raises her hand to a chin, this is what we call evaluation or analysis so it shows that she is deeply interested in what those she is interacting with are doing and saying, and also the fact she is authentic, it is not a contrived or deliberate action. The body language denotes she really wants to be there and she\u2019s happy.\u201d</p> <figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\"> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The inspirational work of the Reading Ukrainian Community Centre is non-stop, and it\u2019s changing lives!<br> <br>Providing practical advice on employment and housing, delivering educational classes for children and building social connections, the centre is at the heart of the community. <a href=\"https://t.co/tn1Vrk846L\">pic.twitter.com/tn1Vrk846L</a></p>\u2014 The Prince and Princess of Wales (@KensingtonRoyal) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KensingtonRoyal/status/1593250839401230337?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 17, 2022</a></blockquote><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script> </div></figure> <p>Stanton added: \u201cWhen she spoke to an older gentleman at the center, he had his hands behind his back in an authoritative gesture and she placed her hands in front of her.

The regrouping of the bulls at $0.022 will give them the advantage to reclaim their ground in the market. pressure in the early part of today\u2019s trading session, there were reactions on both the upper band and the lower band of the Bollinger indicator. This means bulls are still strong to drive the price upward. They are holding firmly to their new support price level. Now at around the latest trading sessions, we noticed the contraction of the upper and lower band of the indicator. This signals a bullish breakout as both the forces of demand and the forces of supply get evenly matched From this point of view, we can see that support level remains a strong brick wall. The bearish price continues to be rejected as several attempts were made to bring the price lower than this level. With such a strong support price level like this one, the price of TAMA is expected to have a strong bullish price breakout. The price is expected soon to hit $0.0024. Tamadoge has a fully transparent 10-year plan, and to achieve its goals, They have employed a seasoned development team to make sure they deliver on all its promises.",

    "content": "The went on a steep price dive on November 8 after the price hits $0.28. It was almost like a unanimous decision by traders to take profits at the height of that price level. In two days the price decline hits $0.15. This was the support price level from where the market price began to rebound. Now as the price of the market nears the $0.28 price level, the price was rejected and in today\u2019s market, the price goes the bullish way After a support level was secured at $0.15, the bull market faced rejection at $0.228. But because the force behind the trend is still strong, it resumed its upside journey until it came to $0.28. The bearish move in today\u2019s market has a strong outlook. But its progress remains pegged at around the $0.25 price level. If the demand force behind the market trend remains strong as we have noticed in the previous session, the trend may continue. Today\u2019s bearish market move is yet to cross the 20-day moving average. And the RSI line is yet to cross the signal line of the RSI indicator. Likewise in the MACD indicator, the MACD line is yet to cross the MACD signal line. There for, a bearish trend cannot be confirmed yet for the Chiliz market. We need to patiently wait to see the direction of the market in the next session. The day\u2019s trading session opens with the failure of the buying pressure to advance the price beyond the November 8 resistance price level. A massive bearish move took place in the second trading session. But since the third session, it looks like the buyers have successfully secured a new support level at around $0.25 price level. The momentum of the selling pressure is waning at this level. Likewise (and more than the bullish performance of Chiliz) a new token still in its presale shows the prospect of much upside price performance. The collapse of FTX brings about a need for a cutting-edge trading intelligence platform, and that exactly is what offers. It is a platform that can adequately detect impending adverse issues similar to what happened to FTX and thus enabling investors and traders to pinpoint safe opportunities for good profits. The D2T token presale is ongoing and it has raised $6.5million so far.",

    "content": "It has been that there has been a continuation in the SOL/USD market bulls\u2019 pushing weight weaknesses as the crypto coin falls near the $10 support line. The last several hours of trading have metamorphosed between $13.27 and $12.57, keeping a pace of minus 2.71 percentage rate as of the time of writing. Resistance levels: $20, $25, $30 Support levels: $10, $7.50, $5 The SOL/USD daily chart reveals the crypto market falls near the $10 support level in a range-bound style as the $20 resistance level is the upper range part. Two horizontal lines have to highlight the value lines where range motions are featured. The 14-day SMA indicator is $21.69, underneath the $30.89 value line of the 50-day SMA indicator. The Stochastic Oscillators have tightly conjoined to maintain a consolidation-moving posture in the oversold region at 13.95 and 14.15 levels, indicating there is a light myth that the former trading instrument will strive for a recovery soon. Prolongation of the market bulls\u2019 weaknesses may potentially degenerate into giving bears more strength in the range-bound spots to push down below the $10 support level as the price falls near it. At this point, a 1-hour chart will let long-position placers detect an early stage of spotting the possibility of price making a rebound before joining the move from a baseline afterward. In terms of investment talk, this time could be the best period to add to portfolio sizes. On the downside of the technical analysis, as it is, it appears not to be the time to join an ongoing declining force in the range-bound spots of $20 and $10 of the SOL/USD market operations. A chain of lower lows has formed toward the lower range line. It does possess an ideal technical window opportunity for getting decent entries. It may as be highly psychologically inclining to exit some of the sell orders that might have executed below the $40 point or around the $30. In comparison, has deepened into lower range-bound spots below the trend lines of the SMAs. The 14-day SMA indicator is underneath the trend line of the 50-day SMA indicator. The Stochastic Oscillators are consolidating their presences in the oversold region at 12.60 and 12.28 levels to indicate that the base crypto may still witness some debase-moving pattern against the counter-trading crypto for a while. A bullish candlestick that can emerge from a lower zone will be a notification sign toward getting upswings to invalidate the continuation of the bearish trend. For now, the collapse of FTX brings about a need for a cutting-edge trading intelligence platform, and that exactly is what Dash 2 Trade offers. It is a platform that can adequately detect impending adverse issues similar to what happened to FTX, thus enabling investors and traders to pinpoint safe opportunities for good profits.

    "content": "The year 2022 has been one of the most turbulent years for the global financial economy, including the crypto industry. With the crypto market already suffering the consequences of a severe bearish trend, things worsened further at the start of this year. As the world was recovering from the realities of the Covid industry, things worsened further with Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. All these factors significantly impacted Bitcoin\u2019s performance in the market. It is surprising considering Bitcoin attained its all-time high value exceeding the $60k mark in just November last year. Unfortunately, the fall of FTX also resulted in adverse consequences for the token bringing its value down to a two-year low in recent times. But will BTC exceed the $17k mark this weekend? Continue reading to find out. If you have been keeping up with the developments in the crypto industry, you must have attended to the news about FTX\u2019s collapse. The entire fiasco went on for a couple of weeks until recently, when FTX\u2019s Sam Fried-Bankman had to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. As you know, FTX was one of the leading crypto exchanges operating in the market at the start of this year. The CEO of the exchange had, in fact, earned himself the reputation for being the savior of the industry. He did so by acquiring many other crypto projects that were suffering due to the bearish performance of the market. The good times for FTX went on for quite some time until a new report from CoinDesk spilled out all the beans in front of the world. The report featured a leaked balance sheet from Alameda Research, FTX\u2019s trading company. The balance sheet brought forward many unanticipated truths that swept the crypto industry. The balance sheet highlighted that most of Alameda\u2019s assets were FTT tokens, the native currency of the FTX exchange. This meant trouble since the CEO was using this asset holding as collateral for funding many risky projects. Following this revelation, Binance came into the picture with an announcement that it shall be liquidating all its FTT holdings. This struck fear among investors and traders, given Binance is by far one of the largest investors in the exchange. Consequently, people went into a mode of panic and started withdrawing funds from the exchange and selling all their FTT holdings. However, FTX decided to close down its withdrawal processing, which only worsened things. But things looked like they would change for good after Binance announced its plans to acquire FTX. Unfortunately, even this deal fell apart as even Binance could not handle the mess FTX had in its books. Quite a few officials from Binance even went on to call FTX\u2019s books a black hole where one cannot make sense of almost anything. Following these developments, the FTX CEO, Sam Bankman Fried, filed for bankruptcy. Of course, Bitcoin is still the dominant player in the crypto market, and it has the potential to set trends in the crypto world. But that does not mean it is independent of all other developments in the industry. Following the collapse of FTX, almost every token in the market felt the heat, including Bitcoin. One of the primary rationales behind this is that people are now very reluctant in many ways and are somewhat wary about investing in cryptos. This evidently resulted in a huge drain of capital in the market, further deteriorating the overall aggravating situation. Hence, the collapse of FTX has had a direct or indirect impact on Bitcoin\u2019s value. The recent developments in the crypto industry have devastatingly impacted Bitcoin\u2019s overall valuation. Things went so bad so quickly that the token fell below the $18k mark after months and plunged into a new two-year low. However, as Bitcoin prices are picking up once again, things seem to change with each passing day. While the token has dabbled between low price ranges of $14k to 15k in the past couple of weeks, this week, Bitcoin reached over $16k after quite a long time. At the time of writing this, Bitcoin is priced at $16,665, and this has left many wondering if the token will break the $17k mark this weekend. There can be many factors fueling this rise, but the most important factor has something to do with the country of El Salvador. The president of the country, Nayib Bukele, recently announced they would be buying Bitcoins on a daily basis starting from the 17th of November. The country currently has 2,381 BTC worth a total investment of $39.4 million, down from $103 million due to recent developments. Following this, President Bukele declared the country would start buying more BTC every day starting from the 17th of November. This news came three months after the last BTC acquisition of the country. The stakeholders welcomed this move as it will put the demand and supply equation into play and change things for good. While Bitcoin started the day with a good announcement, the token\u2019s price has remained the same. The best one can do now is wait for the weekend to be over and see if the token can break the $17k mark. The crypto world is volatile, and stakeholders are well aware of the nature of the market. Thus, it is never always possible to predict the future of a token since anything can change at any given time. But that does not mean you should stop investing in this market and go home. Instead, you must learn lessons from these developments and use these situations to your advantage. The collapse of FTX highlights the significance of more intelligent trading platforms like that will help one find the right opportunities and make the most of them. Besides that, there is with its native token, $TARO, ideal for beating the next price rise with its new $100k milestone. Also, is nearing its $2 million mark, while is nearing the staggering $13 million benchmark. This shows that the crypto industry is not short of opportunities as long as you can find the right one.",

    "content": "American CryptoFed DAO, the first decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) to get legal recognition in the United States, is at risk of losing its registration after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) dug up anomalies in the Form S-1 registration statement dated Sept. 17, 2021. The Wyoming Secretary of State\u2019s office recognized American CryptoFed as a legal entity in July 2021 , at a time when the organization\u2019s CEO, Marian Orr, believed that \u201cWyoming is arguably the top blockchain jurisdiction in the world.\u201d However, on Nov. 18, 2022, the SEC instituted administrative proceedings against the DAO to determine the issuance of a stop order. A stop order from the SEC would retract American CryptoFed\u2019s registration and bar sales of in-house tokens, Ducat and Locke. According to the SEC\u2019s Division Of Enforcement, the Form S-1 registration statement filed by American CryptoFed lacks vital information, such as audited financial statements and details about its business and management. The SEC further believed that the American CryptoFed filing contains \u201cmisleading statements and omissions\u201d while being inconsistent in describing the tokens as securities. In this regard, David Hirsch, Chief of the Enforcement Division\u2019s Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit stated that: Hirsch clarified that issuers must provide the required disclosure information to the SEC. However, the SEC claimed non-cooperation from American CryptoFed during its examination of its registration statement. Based on the information made available to the public, Hirsch shared SEC intent regarding the DAO: Cointelegraph found that the official Telegram channel for the DAO has been disabled. However, the deletion of the Telegram account was not yet linked to the SEC\u2019s investigation at the time of writing. American CryptoFed has not yet responded to Cointelegraph\u2019s request for comment.

    "content": "Less than a couple of weeks back, crypto suffered a market-wide crash where most cryptocurrencies fell massively in price, many showing a decline of over 30%. Bitcoin, for example, slipped by close to $5.5k and is barely making a recovery. Amidst the market downfall, triggered by the FTX balance sheet concerns, there were a few coins that were able to pull themselves up. Although nowhere near their price before the drop, these coins have performed certainly well in the past 24 hours. Unlike the market leader Bitcoin which has shown almost no signs of recovery in the past week. To understand how the top crypto gainers have held firm for the past 24 hours, we must examine the tokens and the sentiment around them that dictated their price. Here are a few top gainers that display some optimism in the market, along with a few cryptocurrencies that turn out to be an ideal choice for investors, given the current market condition. is a decentralized blockchain network that supports a range of applications while being a self-sustaining, secure and efficient blockchain throughout. Launched in 2019, the blockchain operates on Proof of Stake and has a native token by the ticker symbol ALGO. Following the crash that commenced on Nov 8, the token dropped from $0.40 to $0.26 and touched a low of $0.24 on Nov 14. Since the low, the ALGO token has shown an upward trend and is currently trading at $0.30, gaining close to 6% in the last 24 hours. In May, FIFA announced its partnership with Algorand making it an official blockchain platform of FIFA. This news sent a wave of excitement among investors, and as the world cup is about to start on Nov 20, investors are anticipating a positive performance from the coin. While the crypto crash imposed selling pressure on investors, the belief that Algorand\u2019s association with reputable organizations will make it an appealing coin of choice in the long term has prevailed in the market. Owing to this, the coin continues to trace its path upwards, showing a decent increase in price in less than a day. If you\u2019re familiar with the term metaverse, there\u2019s very little chance that you haven\u2019t heard about Sandbox is among the top metaverses in crypto, or in general for that matter, and is fundamentally among the most solid crypto tokens in the market. It is a decentralized NFT metaverse, where users can purchase, create and sell their virtual reality NFTs, or buy a plot of land inside the metaverse. The project has a lot of big names associated with it, with one being the popular hip-hop artist Snoop Dogg. The primary reason the coin has managed to recover from its price drop is that it\u2019s been almost a couple of weeks since the crash took place, and the concerning sentiment across the crypto market is starting to fade off. Sandbox, being one of the best high-utility crypto projects, presents a great opportunity for new investors, more so because the token is now available at a discounted price. In addition to that, the price of the token is less than a dollar, making it highly accessible to all users. Given these characteristics, the project has attracted some attention in the last few days. Internet Computer offers a decentralized alternative to the current internet cloud providers, by allowing independent data centers to interact with each other. The platform allows users to create applications, websites and other web services. ICP has been cited as an \u201cavoidable\u201d crypto project when it comes to adding it to your portfolio, most because the token is down more than 99% since its launch, and has continued to trace a perpetual decline ever since. While the project has displayed a gain in the past 24 hours, mostly triggered by the daily cycle burn of its tokens- recorded to be the maximum this month. This in no way encourages investment in the project, given the long-term view isn\u2019t as bright as it may appear to be. If you\u2019re looking for cryptos that can offer exponential returns in the longer run, we have a few suggestions: It is clear from the FTX crash that there is a need for an advanced trading intelligence platform and is just the solution. The platform can help suggest investors\u2019 safe choice of investments while making sure investors get above-market average returns from their investments. The platform integrates an on-chain analysis tool, and a social sentiment indicator and notifies users of new presales and launches, helping them assess potentially highly rewarding cryptocurrencies. The token for the platform D2C is currently in phase 3 of its presale and has raised over $6.6 million so far. Given such a high investment, the project comes out to be potentially one of the best rewarding crypto projects once it lists on an exchange. Blockchains are constantly criticized for their high energy usage, and the consequent environmental harm they impose. However, there\u2019s a crypto project that aims to counteract the negative impact of crypto on the environment, by partnering with brands and helping them manage their carbon credits. When users shop with the brands associated with , they are rewarded with IMPT tokens which can be used to purchase carbon credits. Users can retire their Carbon credits in exchange for NFTs from popular artists or sell them as they see fit. As an investor, if you\u2019re looking for a high-value crypto project, IMPT should be under your consideration. The presale for the token is currently live, and they\u2019ve raised close to $13 million, more than halfway through their target for the presale. The play-to-earn ecosystem is said to thrive the most once crypto gaming becomes mainstream and Calvaria could potentially be among the top players ruling the industry. is a P2E game, played with NFT battle cards, where each card represents a character with a set of unique traits. With a combination of these cards, users advance in the game. Winners will be paid in RIA tokens, which can either be staked or can be used to make in-game purchases. Along with that, token holders also get the right to vote in the official DAO of the platform. The project is currently in phase 4 of its presale and has raised over 1.86 million USDT (roughly equal to the same in US dollars) so far. Investors willing to venture into the crypto play-to-earn ecosystem should consider IMPT as their choice of investment. Although all the tokens listed above have a low entry point and show a lot of potential, it\u2019s best for investors to conduct their research before investing in a crypto project. With that being said, the coins mentioned above could potentially deliver exponential returns, as long as they follow their roadmap and receive continuous support from the community.",

    "description": "GBTC shares keep getting cheaper versus Bitcoin \u2014 an ideal reason to buy for ARK Invest and Lawrence Lepard.",
    "content": "The largest Bitcoin ( BTC ) institutional investment vehicle is coming under suspicion as it trades at a record discount. The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) is the latest Bitcoin industry entity to feel the heat from the debacle over defunct exchange FTX . With contagion and fears over a deeper market rout everywhere in Bitcoin and altcoins at present, misgivings are impacting even the best-known \u2014 and trusted \u2014 crypto industry names. In recent days, it was the turn of GBTC, the long-embattled Bitcoin investment fund, amid problems at a related crypto firm, Genesis Trading. As Cointelegraph reported , parent company Digital Currency Group (DCG), as well as operator Grayscale itself, swiftly sought to reassure investors and the market that its flagship product was financially watertight. This did not appear enough to satisfy nerves, however, leading to additional public declarations of faith in DCG and GBTC. Among them was Coinbase Institutional, the institutional investment arm of major exchange Coinbase. \u201cNothing is more important than ensuring our clients' assets are safe,\u201d it tweeted on Nov. 17. GBTC\u2019s image has been under strain for some time. Since 2021, it has traded at a discount to the BTC spot price, a discount which is now approaching 50% . Amid a lack of demand, speculation has increased thanks to rumors that Grayscale may end up being bought should Genesis Trading fail. This change of tack could have implications for GBTC, as Grayscale notionally remains intent on converting it to an exchange-traded fund (ETF). \u201cThough this is a difficult moment for many in crypto, I am deeply optimistic about the future of this industry, Grayscale 's business, and the opportunity for investors,\u201d Grayscale CEO, Michael Sonnenshein, tweeted on Nov. 19. Consensus on the $10.5 billion GBTC potentially being forcibly sold remains weak. Related: Grayscale cites security concerns for withholding on-chain proof of reserves \u201cGenesis may go under, but I find the odds of GBTC trust being liquidated to be highly unlikely just given the cash cow that it has been,\u201d Lyle Pratt, creator of messaging platform Vida Global, reacted . The steepening discount following the FTX saga has meanwhile made GBTC a somewhat ironic \u201cbuy\u201d for names such as ARK Invest and Lawrence Lepard, investment manager at Equity Management Associates. \u201cLots of questions and DM's. Lepard view on Grayscale and GBTC Spoiler alert: I own it,\u201d he began a dedicated Twitter thread by saying over the weekend. On the topic of how bad the contagion could be for DCG and its family of firms, Leopard nonetheless acknowledged that it \u201cis impossible to know how much distress they are in.\u201d He continued to analyze the fallout should the worst-case scenario \u2014 bankruptcy \u2014 ensue.

    "description": "TIME spoke with Intuit's Sasan Goodarzi about how the slowing economy is affecting his customers and his top concerns as a CEO.",
    "content": "(To receive weekly emails of conversations with the world\u2019s top CEOs and business decisionmakers, click here .) In Silicon Valley, a land littered with success stories, Sasan Goodarzi\u2019s tale is anything but typical. Born in Tehran, he and his family immigrated to the U.S. to escape the Iranian Revolution. Within six months, his father died, forcing his older brothers to find a way to support the family. Coming to America as a 9-year-old, Goodarzi says he faced not just a new language and unfamiliar culture, but outright hatred and bullying in school, which stifled his love of learning and led to him graduating from high school in Orlando, Florida with a C-minus average. Goodarzi found his footing and ultimately rose to become chief executive of software stalwart, Intuit, in early 2019, after earning a master\u2019s in business administration from the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University and decades of experience in the tech sector. Still, his early struggles inform his management style and worldview. When global protests over Iran\u2019s treatment of women erupted in September, Goodarzi spoke out. \u201cThe amazing people of Iran are showing what they\u2019re made of,\u201d he wrote on Twitter in early September. \u201cHuge respect for the brave women who are risking their lives to let the world know the line has been crossed and are demanding their basic human rights. As a native Iranian, I stand with you and could not be more proud.\u201d A few weeks later, he urged his peers to get involved. \u201cIf you have a platform, make your voice count,\u201d he tweeted. Intuit, approaching its 40th anniversary in 2023, develops and operates a collection of software products and services aimed at helping individuals and small businesses manage their finances. But Goodarzi sums up the company\u2019s broader aims as a mission \u201cto power the prosperity of those that we serve.\u201d The Mountain View, Calif.-based company\u2019s offerings include TurboTax, QuickBooks, Credit Karma, Mint and Mailchimp. Since assuming the role of chief executive, Goodarzi has not only set ambitious goals for Intuit\u2019s growth, but has also made a bold public pledge to the company\u2019s customers. That is, to double the household savings rate for people using Intuit\u2019s services and to improve the success rate of small businesses on its platform by 10% over the national average\u2014both by 2025. The average U.S. household saved about 7.9% of its disposable income in the two years before the pandemic, according to the OECD, and only half of small businesses survive beyond their fifth year. To date, Goodarzi says Intuit has surpassed that small business success rate and is over halfway to the household savings rate goal. TIME spoke with Goodarzi recently about how the slowing economy is affecting his customers. He laid out one of his top concerns as a CEO, and talked about what it takes to get hired at Intuit. This interview has been condensed and edited for clarity. ( For coverage of the future of work, visit TIME.com/charter and sign up for the free Charter newsletter. ) Intuit has a portfolio of products that help individuals and businesses organize their finances. What are you seeing right now from your customers as inflation is putting a squeeze on consumers and small businesses? We have a lot of data. So we see consumer spending on our platform. We see bank account balances, because small businesses connect to bank accounts. We actually see the number of employees and we see worker hours paid and hours worked. And I would just say in this environment, believe it or not, small businesses and consumers are generally healthy. Now, let me tell you about both sides of the coin, so I don\u2019t mislead. The small businesses that we serve\u2014they are growing. Their biggest issue is they can\u2019t hire enough employees, and they\u2019re thriving. Consumers\u2019 unemployment is still very low. And when we look at account balances of consumers, they\u2019re actually better than they\u2019ve been in years. The other side of that is very real. Consumers and small businesses are paying more for rent. They\u2019re paying more for food. They\u2019re paying higher gasoline prices. And if you\u2019re a small business, you\u2019re also paying more for this very employee that you needed to hire now, versus five years ago. So that\u2019s taking a chunk out of the pocketbook. For about two years, many people weren\u2019t commuting to work, or going to stores and restaurants. So they saved money. But do you think something fundamentally changed during the pandemic? Are Americans being a little more cautious with their money\u2014saving more? What we\u2019ve experienced in the last 18 months is people were cooped up in their homes, and when they were un-cooped, people got out. They started spending money. They started traveling. That\u2019s why airlines are reporting great earnings or bullish futures. I think what you\u2019re starting to see now is consumers starting to pull back. They\u2019re starting to buy cheaper brands, although they\u2019re still spending their money. Why? Because they\u2019re having to pay more for gas. They\u2019re having to pay more for rent. They\u2019re having to pay a lot more for food. Sugar is up 70%, for example. So consumers are starting to be careful about spending less in other places. But I don\u2019t think that consumers are being smarter with their money. If they have it, they\u2019re going to spend it. As a CEO, what are your main challenges right now? The biggest one\u2014the thing we worry about most, that we talk about most\u2014is speed. It\u2019s about the velocity of innovation. It\u2019s about moving fast, allowing our engineers to code, versus being in meetings, or being part of a decision. Speed is a leadership decision, and a company at our scale, if you can move fast and deliver for your customers, it actually becomes an advantage. The second thing is always making sure that we\u2019re growing our employees and accessing great talent. We spend a lot of time talking about and architecting the company around speed and access to great talent. What roles are you looking to fill most at the moment? Is it programmers or something else? It\u2019s in engineering, but it\u2019s a couple of specific areas. The core element of our strategy is centered around data and artificial intelligence. Because it\u2019s all about how we leverage the data and how we apply AI to accelerate our innovation. Therefore, the areas where we have added a lot of talent\u2014and we continue to look for talent\u2014is data scientists, data engineers, systems engineers that can think from a systems perspective, and mobile application engineers. If you\u2019re someone who has that kind of expertise and you\u2019re interviewing at Intuit, is there a surefire way of getting the company interested in you? Well, let\u2019s use a data scientist as an example. We have a process that we call A for A, it\u2019s Assessing for Awesome. That includes a one-to-one conversation. But there\u2019s also a panel conversation of two or three people. That data scientist gets a case study, and they have to come in and present to that several-person panel, and explain how they would handle a situation. The things we look for from a data scientist is 1) Do they think about the problem from the lens of what they\u2019re going to do for the customer and the impact they\u2019re going to have for the customer? Because at the end of the day, our boss is the customer. And 2) Do they actually have the ability to apply their data science craft and demonstrate it, not just talk about it\u2014demonstrate their capability around what technologies they\u2019re familiar with, what code they\u2019re familiar with, where they think technology is going, and how they would apply that to the customer problem. And then, of course, the third thing is interaction. How do they interact? Are they going to be able to work on a team? Because a data scientist can\u2019t work alone. If I am hiring a data scientist executive, I\u2019m really looking for the same things. But also asking: Can they lead at scale? Do they know how to hire great people? What track record do they have of transforming an organization? Lots of people in your position are saying it\u2019s really difficult to hire great people with the job market still very competitive. Is Intuit doing anything differently as it relates to hiring? It\u2019s been a challenging environment to hire the best of the best. If we\u2019re competing with another company, once we get a candidate to visit and learn about the problems that they would solve for our customers versus somewhere else, our acceptance rate has been very, very high. They just felt like we had some hairy problems that they wanted to be a part of solving. Also, our attrition rate in the last year was five points lower than any of our peer companies. With all that said, access to talent has been hard, but we\u2019ve been able to achieve our hiring ramp in the last couple of years. Apart from this need to tackle thorny problems, what else do you think is drawing engineers to Intuit? Well, I\u2019ll tell you what I hear from the folks that we hire. I talk to new hires and I also spent a lot of my time doing chats with our frontline engineers at our different sites, particularly those that have been with us for one to three years. I get a firsthand feel for what they love, and also what we need to improve, which is a question I always ask them. The big thing is they like actually working on things that will impact another human being. They\u2019re working on a project that will give you early access to your refund by five days, or instant access to your tax refund. They\u2019re working on things that allow a customer to get paid much faster once they send an invoice. They\u2019re working on benefit programs as part of our payroll platform. They also love it because when their code gets deployed, they can see on the other end the actual impact it had on a human being. And it\u2019s a real impact, because it\u2019s about money. Those are the things that really get the heartbeats of those new hires going much faster, and why they choose to join the company. When you have those conversations with them, what are some of the things they say you need to improve? The consistent themes I hear: They love how customer-centric we are. They love our culture. They love how everybody\u2019s here to help each other collaborate and win. But they wish we would make decisions faster, and they wish they didn\u2019t have to attend as many meetings to get their work done. In all those areas, we\u2019re getting better, but I consistently hear the same thing. Meetings are a real thorny issue. Have you figured out a way of reducing meetings and accelerating actual work? If so, do you have any tips? First of all, we\u2019ve improved a lot in this area. We are nowhere near where we need to be. There\u2019s a couple of things we are doing. One is, we set no meetings in the afternoons for our engineers. One of the big things with engineers is you don\u2019t want to distract them. They can\u2019t code for an hour, jump into a meeting, come back and code for an hour, because they have to spend 20% of the time after they come back to figure out where they left off. So, now they always have four or five hours of uninterrupted coding time. That\u2019s working, and we continue to monitor it. We also realize it\u2019s not being followed everywhere in the company, so we keep working it out. That\u2019s a good one. Any other tips? The other is the concept of two-way doors versus one-way doors. The majority of decisions we make, there are two-way doors. If you make it and you made a mistake or it wasn\u2019t a good decision, you can come back in. A one-way door is you, once you make the decision, you can\u2019t just turn around and say, \u201cOh oops.\u201d If you pay $10 billion for an acquisition, you don\u2019t just turn around and say, \u201cOops.\u201d That\u2019s a one way door. So what we\u2019re working on is being clear, and it\u2019s something we\u2019re working on right now actually, is being clear that 95% plus of decisions are two-way doors, and to enable our teams to move without having to get into meetings. Because a lot of the meetings are two-way doors where you get into a meeting and you\u2019re presenting to management, you don\u2019t even need to do that, just go do it. But culturally, there is a sort of need for a manager wanting to call a meeting on something that they don\u2019t need to. So that\u2019s what we are working on, and we believe it will work. The other is continuing to get better at when you have a meeting, good hygiene. Why are you in the meeting? What decision are you going to make? Who are the three, four people you need in the meeting, versus 50 people in a meeting? And then it should be a decision meeting or an ideation meeting. You shouldn\u2019t get into a meeting just to inform someone and provide an update. That can be done asynchronously. So those are the things that we\u2019re working on. As we all emerge from the pandemic, what\u2019s your opinion about whether work needs to be done in the office or not? When the world shut down in March of 2020, we overnight went virtual with, right now we have over 17,000 employees. We went home overnight. And the good news is we\u2019re a technology company. We have all the tools and we could work virtually. And frankly, many things over time accelerated, because people were actually more productive and effective. So we felt like we needed to really step back and think about what we wanted to do, versus just assuming we all come back to work. What that means to us is that we announce that we\u2019re letting mission based teams decide which days they want to come together in the office and work, and which days they want to work virtually. We did not prescribe, \u201cYou have to be in the office Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday.\u201d We\u2019re letting teams do it, and the reason for that is when we sent everybody home overnight, we didn\u2019t give them instructions. Everybody just worked virtually, and then we figured out how to work in our mission based groups. So we are leveraging that learning as we\u2019re in a hybrid environment.

    "description": "The best way to honor her legacy is by documenting, amplifying, and paying attention to the attacks trans people are facing",
    "content": "Monica Roberts began tracking violence against the trans community in 2006, long before national organizations, governmental agencies, and, perhaps most important, the media, were paying close attention. Her award-winning blog, TransGriot , aggregated local news, police reports, and community-sourced information. Her no-frills style of reporting and her reputation as a trusted journalist and blogger in the community made her a critical resource. Tapping into a rich network of trans people on social media and tips received via email, Roberts was a go-to for trans activists across the country, particularly during a time when the media wasn\u2019t regularly reporting on the killings of trans people or doing so in a way that honored the lives of those lost. \u201cMonica was making sure that not only was she cataloging these murders, whenever there was an article that was written when the person was misgendered, she was able to write the article correctly,\u201d said trans activist Dee Dee Waters, who was also a longtime friend of Monica. \u201cIt was really good to have her, as we tried to conquer a lot of this transphobic stuff.\u201d In West African culture, a griot is a tribal storyteller who acts as an advisor to leaders and serves as a living archive. For more than a decade, Monica offered that crucial service to a community that is often overlooked and mistreated. When I worked at the New York City Anti-Violence Project (AVP) , part of my job was to track violence against LGBTQ people, and Monica\u2019s blog was invaluable. She regularly broke stories that went beyond the violence that trans communities disproportionately face. As a growing movement and understanding for trans communities progressed in the aughts, so did her coverage, with posts about trans people in politics, music, and TV and film . As individual states act with increasing hostility to trans people\u2014 The Washington Post reported that, as of Oct. 13, more than 155 pieces of anti-trans legislation had been introduced this year alone\u2014violence against the trans community is only going to get worse. These laws attack bodily autonomy and self-identification, as well as deny crucial medical care and have introduced harmful discussion about sexual orientation and gender identity. Which means we need people in the world\u2014from the mainstream media to elected officials to allies of trans and nonbinary people\u2014to sit up, pay attention, and spread the word of the ongoing violence trans people face. In the fall of 2020, Monica died at 56 years old . Her unexpected death, due to blood clots in her lungs, reverberated throughout the LGBTQ community. The Association of LGBTQ Journalists (NLGJA) lauded her groundbreaking journalism, and the National Association of Black Journalists (NABJ) posthumously inducted her to its hall of fame . Her blog now lives on as an archive , and more digital content will be produced by Transgriot LLC under the leadership of Waters, with plans to continue additional reporting on the issues facing Black trans Americans. The legacy she left is one of watching out for and taking care of her community, especially in moments when it seemed as if few outside of the community were listening or taking action. In one of Monica\u2019s last posts on anti-trans violence , she documented the murder of Selena Reyes Hernandez, who was shot and killed by 18-year-old Orlando Perez after she disclosed that she was transgender to him. \u201cShe is the sixth Latinx transperson to die in 2020 and the 14th transperson this year, but I\u2019m just now finding out about this May 31 murder because of misgendering of her by the Chicago medical examiner, Chicago PD and the Chicago media,\u201d wrote Roberts on her blog. \u201cEven her family went there in disrespecting her in death, choosing to bury her in her native Mexico under her deadname.\u201d Monica Roberts at the GLAAD Gala in San Francisco on Sept. 8, 2016. Kimberly White\u2014GLAAD/Getty Images In 2019, the American Medical Association (AMA) and the Human Rights Campaign (HRC) called the killings of trans Americans an epidemic following at least 28 homicides in 2018 and 25 homicides in 2019. \u201cAccording to available tracking, fatal anti-transgender violence in the U.S. is on the rise and most victims were black transgender women,\u201d said AMA board member S. Bobby Mukkamala, M.D., in a 2019 press release . \u201cThe number of victims could be even higher due to underreporting and better data collection by law enforcement is needed to create strategies that will prevent anti-transgender violence.\u201d Since then, homicides of trans people have doubled to historic levels of violence with limited media attention or public outcry. In 2020, there were at least 44 homicides of trans and nonbinary people, and 57 in 2021, and 33 so far through this year, according to Sue Kerr, a blogger and social worker who is one of the few individuals tracking violence against trans folks. \u201cWhen Kathryn Newhouse was killed in Georgia, nineteen, murdered by her father. And she\u2019s AAPI, she\u2019s autistic, and she has mental health issues. All these intersections, no one wrote about it,\u201d Kerr said about a murder that happened March . \u201cThe one thing I\u2019ve noticed that\u2019s a big difference from when I was writing these in \u201814, \u201815, \u201816, is that people on the ground, usually the friends of the deceased, are all over the media.\u201d This was the case for 28-year-old Brazil Johnson, who was shot and killed in Milwaukee, Wis., in June. Johnson\u2019s family and friend\u2019s described her to a local outlet as \u201ckind-hearted .\u201d The family and friends of 50 year-old Nedra Sequence Morris , who was killed in May, organized a vigil on her behalf to demand justice. The friends and community of trans people, commonly known as chosen family, now serve as unofficial media spokespersons, and become advocates for their friends, or loved ones after death. There are a handful of individuals and organizations across the country tracking the violence against trans people. The Anti-Violence Project ( AVP ) continues to lead a national coalition of organizations doing data collection on anti-LGBTQ violence. TransLashMedia , led by trans media personality Imara Jones, marks each trans individual\u2019s death on their Instagram channel. HRC also tracks anti-trans violence and releases an annual report . Every year the constant has been an emphasis from advocates to say \u201cat least\u201d alongside any number about the murder of trans people\u2014knowing that with the limited available tracking, there are names of trans people whose stories go untold. It\u2019s important to remember that violence against marginalized communities does not begin with murder. It starts with the acceptance, both passive and deliberate, of increasingly hateful rhetoric, which fuels legislation and emboldens people to commit acts of violence. Trans people, disproportionately Black trans women, are facing violence on the streets and from intimate partners, family, or co-workers, and from legislation that aims to dehumanize and ultimately eliminate trans people from the public space. There\u2019s a growing animus against trans people that manifests as violence in real life, and we must call it out for what it is. Every year, on Nov. 20, the LGBTQ community remembers the lives of those lost for the Transgender Day of Remembrance. This year\u2014and every year after\u2014Monica will be remembered as a ferocious leader who cared enough to look out for the needs of her community. She was not only taken too soon, and her absence from our movement will be felt immensely, her care and love for her community always remembered. The way to honor her legacy is for all of us to take up part of the work of documenting, amplifying, and paying attention to the attacks trans people are facing. We cannot stand by idly. We must demand justice. More Must-Reads From TIME Steven Spielberg Waited 60 Years to Tell This Story Who Should Be TIME's 2022 Person of the Year?

    "content": "While investors are eager to learn when they will be able to recover their funds from the now-defunct crypto exchange FTX, insolvency lawyers warn that it could take \u201cdecades.\u201d On November 11, the crypto exchange and 130 affiliates filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the United States. Insolvency lawyer Stephen Earel, partner at Co Cordis in Australia, stated that \u201crealizing\u201d the crypto assets and determining how to distribute the funds will be a \u201cenormous exercise\u201d in the liquidation process, which could take years, if not \u201cdecades.\u201d He attributes this to the complexities associated with cross-border insolvency issues and competing jurisdictions. Earel stated that FTX users are in the same line as everyone else, including creditors, investors, and venture capital funders, and that those who have made \u201ccrypto to crypto trades\u201d may not receive a distribution \u201cfor years.\u201d Simon Dixon, founder of global investment platform BnkToTheFuture and an active participant in the Celsius bankruptcy proceedings, stated that anyone who holds funds on FTX will become creditors, and a creditors committee will be formed to represent their interests. He stated that creditors will eventually be able to access the remaining assets, depending on what remains after bankruptcy costs. According to Binance Australia CEO, these costs could be high due to the time required to recover funds, which means more legal and administrative fees that eat into customers\u2019 returns. Meanwhile, Irina Heaver, Partner at Keystone Law in the UAE, said that users in the Middle East are also feeling the effects of the FTX collapse, as the region was the third largest FTX user base. Heaver explained that because FTX already has a license and regulatory supervision from Dubai\u2019s newly formed Virtual Assets Authority regulator (VARA), the regulators face major complications because they already have a \u201chuge regulatory failure\u201d on their hands. Heaver stated that creditors\u2019 rights will be overseen by the legal system, with courts and bankruptcy administrators involved \u201cwhen and if\u201d FTX enters Chapter 11 bankruptcy procedures. Heaver\u2019s advises people who have suffered significant losses as a result of the FTX collapse to seek legal counsel and join forces with \u201cother injured parties.\u201d The recent FTX collapse has had far-reaching consequences for investors worldwide. According to recent reports, the bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange may have \u201cmore than 1 million creditors.\u201d According to a Reuters article published on November 20, the bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange owes \u201cnearly $3.1 billion\u201d to its top 50 creditors.",

Buyers have been pressing against the barrier at $0.0001800 since November 10. The crypto\u2019s price has attempted to break through the resistance four times but has failed. As it crosses over the moving average lines today On the upside, the altcoin will go toward the next resistance at $0.0002200 if it breaks above the resistance level. But as long as buyers are unable to push the price over the resistance level of $0.0001800, the coin will continue to trade sideways between levels of $0.0001400 and $0.0001800. LBLOCK fell to a low of $0.0001444 on November 19 as it targets the $0.0002200 high. As it reaches the peak of $0.0001674, the bullish momentum has burst over the lines of the moving averages. The region of overbought has been reached by the current rise. The altcoin has a daily Stochastic level of 96. The overbought area is anticipated to offer resistance to LBLOCK. Furthermore, LBLOCK has recovered bullish momentum since its dip on November 9 as it approaches the resistance around $0.0001800. However, Dash 2 Trade, a different coin, has seen its value soar recently. This puts into more perspective the requirement for a cutting-edge trading intelligence platform, and that exactly is what . It is a platform that can adequately detect impending adverse issues similar to what happened to FTX, thus enabling investors and traders to pinpoint safe opportunities for good profits. The D2T token presale is ongoing and it has raised $6.5 million so far. You can purchase Lucky Block here. \u2022 \u2022",

While JHU is responsible for creating the site, additional contributions were made by NASA, the European Space Agency, the National Science Foundation, and the Sloan Foundation. The main page encourages you to scroll down as the viewer watches the number of celestial objects increase and then brings them to a 90-degree view of the night sky that has all 13.7 billion years of the cosmos right there in front of them. While this opening page serves as the summary of the interaction, the \u201cexplore the map\u201d and \u201cdescription\u201d links at the bottom of the page allow the viewer to examine the map in more detail. \u201cExplore the map\u201d lets the viewer scroll back in time in 100-million-year increments all the way to the edge of the observable universe, also known as the Cosmic Microwave Background, while they are provided detailed descriptions of various celestial objects during their journey, which include several types of galaxies and quasars. \u201cDescription\u201d does an excellent job answering questions in detail that the viewer might be asking throughout their journey pertaining to both the map and the instruments that were used to gather the data. These include easy-to-understand figures and diagrams. At the bottom, the viewer is also given the option to either download or purchase the map for their own personal or educational purposes. Overall, this interactive map is small, easy-to-use, and concise in its ability to share the entirety of the cosmos with easy-to-understand descriptions that are likely suitable for astronomy lovers as young as grade school.

    "content": "Customers of the decentralized exchange (DEX) section would reportedly pay gas charges for swaps that are at least 10% less than those of 1inch\u2019s prior offers, making switching activity on the Ethereum network more lucrative for its users. In the Router v5, 1inch predicted that swaps would be 10% more gas efficient compared to the second-best participant in the DEX segment and about 5% more gas efficient than in the previous edition. A new interaction logic, pre-/post-interactions, and an upgraded smart contract error processing system are among the new features and advancements brought to the Router v5 from earlier routers. The latest edition has undergone audits from almost a dozen industry initiatives, including Consensys, OpenZeppelin, and ABDK Consulting, and is also intended to prioritize security. Co-founder of 1inch Network Sergej Kunz said \u201cWe have gathered enough improvements since the 1inch Router v4 was published to warrant the introduction of the new fifth version. [\u2026] In comparison to utilizing any other DeFi device, our users will now save at least 8\u201314% more because to our improved gas cost optimization.\u201d The 1inch Network would implement the 1inch Aggregation Protocol and the 1inch Limit Order Protocol on Avalanche and Gnosis Chain, formerly known as the xDai Chain at the start of the year. In order to give its user base with access to the 1inch Limit Order Protocol v2, as well as deeper liquidity and improved token swaps via the 1inch network, 1inch connected with Klaytn, South Korea\u2019s most well-known metaverse blockchain, in August. The Router v5 is the newest router by DEX aggregator 1inch. The business said that by lowering gas prices for swaps, Router v5 will make consumers\u2019 experiences with decentralized finance (DeFi) more convenient.",

With the beginning of the proceedings of the FTX bankruptcy lawsuit, the exchange said that they owed more than $3 billion to their top 50 creditors. Moreover, it mentioned that it owes nearly $1.45 billion to the top 10 creditors, without naming them. The exchange during the court proceedings said that it was reviewing the assets they have and are preparing for the sale or reorganization of some business. However, as per an expert, the top creditors or the equity holders may be given the first preference for restructuring, while the investors in the Bahamas-based companies may be the next ones to receive.\u00a0 Meanwhile, the FTX account holders could be their least priority as they stand at the end of the queue.\u00a0 yikes.. reason why rich gets richer and retail gets fucked pic.twitter.com/7HvOqYJVzw\u2014 frxresearch (@frxresearch) November 21, 2022 On the other hand, FTX\u2019s sister concern, Alameda Research, a trading platform, has transferred nearly $37 million USDC to an address named FalconX. This is speculated to be user\u2019s funds which were squeezed without intimating them. Meanwhile, the so-called \u2018hacker\u2019 who stole assets worth more than $600 million swapped them into ETH & stablecoins. In a recent update, these ETH were further traded into wBTC & renBTC through aggregators like 1Inch. Therefore, it is pretty clear that the retail traders who traded on FTX exchanges on a daily basis and kept the platform active are the least considered for any restructuring. Moreover, the user\u2019s funds which were stolen, have been utilised. Hence, a re-broadcast of MT. Gox\u2019s rehabilitation plan is expected to repeat, and retail investors may wait for a long time to retrieve their lost funds.",

He is also interested in purchasing some parts of the troubled FTX cryptocurrency exchange. Garlinghouse thinks that if transparency and trust are kept as a priority, the cryptocurrency sector will grow stronger. He places a high value on bitcoin because it gives individuals the opportunity to reject the private monopoly and control over people\u2019s assets for the first time in history \u201cPart of my conversation [with SBF] as if he needs liquidity, maybe there are businesses that he has bought or he has that we would want to own. Maybe there are investments that we would want own. Would we have bought some of those from him? I think that was on the table.\u201d On Nov. 16 and 17, 2022, during the 6th annual RippleSwell conference in London, Mr. Garlinghouse revealed that former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried had called him two days prior to the company declaring bankruptcy in an effort to gather investors to save it. He also took to Twitter and explained in a long thread \u201cWith all that\u2019s happening in the past few weeks (and over the course of this year\u2019s ups and downs), it feels even more imperative that we\u2019ve gathered together in person to have honest conversations about solving real-world problems with crypto and blockchain. As I said on stage \u2013 I firmly believe that crypto will be stronger because of this if we keep focusing on transparency and trust. Ripple has and will continue to lead in this regard.\u201d What\u2019s Next For Ripple Vs SEC? Regarding the SEC\u2019s (Securities and Exchange Commission) lawsuit against Ripple, founder Chris Larsen, and co-founder Garlinghouse, Brad Garlinghouse and Stuart Alderoty both anticipate a decision in the first half of 2023. Final legal briefs must be submitted by Nov. 30 in order for the court to make a decision or schedule a jury trial.",

This is revealed as the bulls seem to have been on a winning streak, after price action tested the floor of the Bollinger indicator. Additionally, price activity seems to have found support at the MA line. Consequently, this implies that we are more likely to witness additional upside moves in Lucky Block price.

Here on the 1-hour chart, we can see that price candles bounced off the Bollinger band but soon resumed their upward path. Subsequently, this resulted in to price rising higher and has placed price further above the MA line. Likewise, the RSI lines are now in the overbought region with the two lines seem positioned to continue in that region. Technically, market signs are aligned to portray possible additional upward move in the price above the $0.0001700. More like what we have here on the LBLOCK market, there is another crypto called the Impact Token. Its presale is still ongoing and has raised approximately $13 million within weeks of its presale. This is because the token is eco-friendly and is attractive to investors, as a result, this supplies bullish sentiment to the token.

He referred to the possibility of a meltdown as \u201cgame over for the games,\u201d meaning that it would be impossible to continue playing. game over for the games, certainly.\u2014 jack (@jack) November 16, 2022 Moreover, Markus is certain that this situation would definitely provoke a \u201cbigger than projected Monday market meltdown.\u201d Cryptocurrency investors have historically responded to disruptions like the recent FTX debacle by selling off their holdings in the market in a frenzy. As a result of all this doubt, some people have even declared Bitcoin \u201cdead.\u201d Does Bitcoin Stand A Chance? According to the analyst\u2019s assessment, the leading cryptocurrency is still active and growing in popularity around the world despite having \u201cdied\u201d more than 460 times. As a result of its restricted supply, it has become legal tender in countries with struggling economies such as El Salvador and the Central African Republic, and many investors see it as a way to protect themselves from inflation. Binance Is Secure, Claims Zhao\u00a0 Many market participants anticipated that the FTX issue would trigger a domino effect and pull other exchanges into the muck, however, the reality was different and the impact wasn\u2019t as bad.\u00a0 The largest cryptocurrency exchange, Binance, on the other hand, confirmed that its financial sheet was stable and even increased the amount of its Secure Asset Fund for Users (SAFU) to $1 billion to protect users in a catastrophe. In addition, the corporation established a recovery fund for the industry, which is intended to assist projects that are having difficulty during difficult economic times. To disprove the allegations, CEO Zhao publicly said that Binance is establishing an industry recovery fund to assist projects that are otherwise robust but are experiencing a liquidity problem. This will serve to lessen the negative effects of FTX that will continue to cascade. We\u2019ll have more information soon.\u00a0 Meanwhile, he issued a challenge to anyone seeking additional information to get in touch with Binance Labs.",

    "content": "According to analyst Benjamin Cowen, BTC could be flashing a bottom signal. Amid rumors threatening to drop BTC to $13k, market participants are still long-term bullish. While several foreboding rumors making the rounds in the crypto market have seen the price of Bitcoin (BTC) dump to less than $16,000, analysts are still confident that the pioneer digital currency could have reached a cyclical bottom. According to popular crypto market analyst Benjamin Cowen, the BTC percentage of supply in profit and loss metric is flashing signs of a historical bottom for the asset. He told his over 774,000 YouTube subscribers that the metric is one of his favorites as it shows the ebb and flow of the market during bear and bull markets. In previous years including 2011, 2014, 2015, 2018, and 2019 when this metric crossed over the 30-day moving average, it accurately marked the bottom of the BTC market. One of my favorite on-chain indicators is the Bitcoin percentage of supply in profit and loss. The reason I like this one is because of how cyclical it looks \u2013 the ebb and flow of this indicator\u2026 If you apply the [30-day] moving average to [the Bitcoin percentage of supply in profit and loss]\u2026 what you\u2019ll notice is that historically, they have always crossed before the bottom was in, His analysis is coming at a time when the price of BTC has hit $15,800 for the first time since 2020. According to an analysis by Santiment, the drop was thanks to fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) due to a lack of trust in exchanges, especially since the FTX exchange collapsed. Exacerbating the situation is the roster of firms that have been run aground or are likely to suffer losses. One of these that have been rumored to be in trouble is Digital Currency Group (DCG), the parent company of Genesis and Grayscale.

Report Another FUD-creating event that is shaking the market is the movement of crypto assets in the wallet of the hacker of the FTX exchange. Blockchain security firm Chainalysis said in a tweet that the FTX hacker has been bridging ETH to BTC. The notice added that the asset is likely to be mixed as the hacker may attempt to cash out through exchanges. \ud83d\udea81/ Funds stolen from FTX are on the move and exchanges should be on high alert to freeze them if the hacker attempts to cash out \u2014 Chainalysis (@chainalysis) November 20, 2022 Market analyst still sees a price explosion for BTC in early 2023 Amid the various speculations that BTC could drop to as low as $13,000, analysts are still long-term bullish for the benchmark crypto. Billionaire venture capitalist Tim Draper said in a recent interview that he still expects BTC to reach $250,000 by early 2023, sticking to his prediction from last year. Draper said that he expects the price target to be reached once the market recovers from the massive FUD and people, especially women, start using Bitcoin for daily shopping. He noted that women\u2019s interest in crypto is already showing signs of increasing, having recently grown from controlling 7.14 percent of Bitcoin wallets to 16.6 percent.

    "content": "The post Ben Armstrong Says \u2018Crypto is Not Dead\u2019, Supports With Evidence appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The FTX crisis and the lowest levels of Bitcoin trading have led to the widespread belief that the crypto industry is dead. Top YouTuber Ben Armstrong, better known as Bitboy, said that cryptocurrency is not dead and will not be, regardless of what happens next. In 2022, Bitcoin has dramatically decreased in value from its all-time high of $69,000 reached in November 2021, having lost 76% of its value in a single year. Crypto is not dead. NO MATTER what happens with GBTC/Genesis/Silvergate.., remember this:When $BTC was barely relevant Mtgox was hacked. 90% of Bitcoin transactions happened there. Almost the entire market at one place\u2026 gone\u2026 poof.And we survived and thrived.\u2014 Ben Armstrong (@Bitboy_Crypto) November 19, 2022 He uses the failure of Mt. Gox, one of the biggest Bitcoin exchanges at the time, as evidence, claiming that the market rebounded well. The Mt. Gox exchange crashed in February 2014 as a result of a major 840,000 BTC hack. A record-breaking high of about $1,100 had been reached by Bitcoin only a few months prior, and Mt. Gox accounted for the majority of transactions\u2014about 90%\u2014at that time. Ben Armstrong predicted the FTX crash? Ben came close to predicting what would occur days in advance, though, so it is important to note that. \u201cIf you don\u2019t close your FTX account today and get your funds off that exchange ASAP, I\u2019m sorry, but you are the definition of low IQ and deserve what\u2019s going to happen to you.\u201d And two weeks later, after everything unraveled, FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried told his clients he was, quote, \u201creally sorry we ended up here,\u201d he had said on Twitter. If you don\u2019t close your @FTX_Official account today and get your funds off that exchange ASAP\u2026 I\u2019m sorry but you are the definition of Low IQ and you deserve what\u2019s going to happen to you.\u2014 Ben Armstrong (@Bitboy_Crypto) October 29, 2022 Armstrong specifically said that Sam Bankman-Fried is urging lawmakers to pass legislation that would rigorously control the cryptocurrency industry. He also pledged to reveal many additional wrongdoings committed by SBF. Additionally, Bitboy asserted that FTX was taking advantage of its users in late October when the exchange\u2019s API was abused. The blogger had already made disparaging remarks about both the exchange and its leader, Bankman-Fried, before the entire incident.",

Grayscale GBTC Trust, the largest legal holder of BTC, refuses to provide any Proof of Reserve. To begin a community lead effort at transparency for the GBTC holdings, we have taken steps to ID likely GBTC addresses and balances based on public info and blockchain forensics. pic.twitter.com/WFtOyoCEay \u2014 \ud83c\udff4\u2234Ergo\u2234\ud83c\udff4 (@ErgoBTC) November 20, 2022 Per the analysis, Ergo reveals that they have identified 432 addresses holding about 317,705 BTC, likely part of the GBTC reserves. It is worth noting that the team started its analysis around July 2019, when Grayscale moved custody of its assets to Coinbase from Xapo. Grayscale declined to release a proof-of-reserves in response to community demands citing security concerns inspiring the effort from Ergo. In the wake of the FTX collapse, the crypto community speculates that Digital Currency Group, the parent company of Genesis Trading, Grayscale, and CoinDesk, is the next domino to fall. It comes after Genesis Trading, arguably crypto\u2019s biggest lender announced its decision to halt operations despite receiving a capital infusion from DCG to cater for the loss of $175 million in assets in the FTX collapse. However, a Wall Street Journal report cites illiquid assets in its balance sheet as the reason for halting withdrawals. The report also indicates it sought $1 billion in capital to resume operations. Genesis is seen as the go-to for institutions and whales looking to lend crypto to earn yield. Consequently, several industry pundits have asserted that a Genesis collapse could have a bigger ripple effect than FTX. Already, Gemini has been forced to halt its earn program. In light of recent information, users speculate DCG itself may be insolvent. According to North Rock Digital founder Hal Press, the size of funds required indicates that the liability lies with DCG . Consequently, users have also called to question the health of the Grayscale trust. Notably, Coinbase released a letter today to assure users of the safety of Grayscale assets in its cold storage wallets. \u201cCoinbase Custody Trust Company, LLC (Coinbase Custody) writes to you to reaffirm that the assets underlying all of Grayscale\u2019s digital asset products held at Coinbase Custody, as listed in the table below, are secure,\u201d Furthermore, it asserts that each user\u2019s assets are kept separately to avoid mixing user assets. \u201cCoinbase Custody always ensures that each client\u2019s digital assets are segregated on-chain, in deep cold-storage, from both the property of Coinbase Custody and the assets of other Coinbase Custody clients,\u201d Coinbase writes. \u201cThis means that the digital assets underlying each Grayscale product will never be commingled with or confused for the digital assets of any other client. This also means that the digital assets of each Grayscale product can be confirmed on-chain.\u201d Despite these assurances, the community continues to frown at the refusal of the exchange to reveal the wallet addresses. Messari founder Ryan Selkis in a tweet today, asserted that this week is likely to be a turbulent one for DCG and its subsidiaries. GBTC continues to trade at a 43% discount to the actual Bitcoin price indicating investor bearishness.
