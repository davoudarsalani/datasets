    "description": "An interview with the outgoing House Speaker",
    "content": "Ever since the election, Nancy Pelosi says, congressional Democrats have been begging her to remain as their leader. Of course, she knew what they were really doing: currying favor, just in case. \u201cOur members were just exploding my phone to stay,\u201d she says, \u201cwhich is a nice thing, because if I don\u2019t stay, then they\u2019ve gotten the points for saying \u2019stay,\u2019 and if I do\u2014\u201c she trailed off, laughing. No matter what she decided, they knew it would be in their interest to be on her good side going forward. For two decades, it has been in every congressional Democrat\u2019s interest to stay in Pelosi\u2019s good graces. Since winning her first leadership position in 2001, she has ruled the House Democratic caucus with an iron fist and a velvet glove, keeping her fractious party in near-lockstep during historically tumultuous times. From the Iraq War to the financial crisis, through health-care reform and government shutdowns, through two presidential impeachments, a pandemic and an insurrection attempt, she has been a constant force and consummate operator. No national politician of her era can match her combination of legislative prowess, vote-counting savvy, negotiating skill, and fundraising ability. [time-brightcove not-tgx=\u201dtrue\u201d] On Thursday, it was finally time to move on\u2014sort of. Shortly after noon, she gave a brief speech on the House floor, announcing that she would not seek re-election as leader of the House Democrats. It was time, she said, \u201cfor a new generation to lead the Democratic caucus that I so deeply respect.\u201d Yet she couldn\u2019t bring herself to step away completely: she owed it to her constituents in San Francisco, she said, to stay on as a rank-and-file member of Congress and finish her two-year term. Like the man who fakes his own death and then sneaks into the funeral, she would stick around to see how her people tried to get along without her. Chip Somodevilla\u2014Getty ImagesNancy Pelosi waves to colleagues while being nominated as the next Speaker of the House during a swearing in ceremony for the 110th Congress in the House Chamber of the U.S. Capitol in Washington, DC., on Jan. 4, 2007. Just after her speech, the 82-year-old House Speaker sat at a white-clothed table in a small, ornate room off the House floor known as the Board of Education, a hidden chamber where former Democratic Speaker Sam Rayburn used to hole up and relax. Then-vice president Harry Truman was playing cards with Rayburn here in 1945 when he learned that FDR had died and he would become President. One wall Rayburn had painted with a Texas seal; on two others, Pelosi recently added her own touches: a painting of the Golden Gate Bridge, and a tribute to women\u2019s suffrage. Pelosi was contemplating the not-quite-end of the era and struggling to unwrap a package of chocolate-chip cookies. \u201cWhat was important to me was how we did in the election, because we were on a bad path,\u201d she told a small group of reporters. \u201cStorming the Capitol, really? And the reaction of Republicans, not taking a stand? And I knew we could win.\u201d Her party had just lost the House, weeks after a crazed intruder broke into her California home and bludgeoned her husband with a hammer. But it hardly felt as if Pelosi was giving up in defeat. In an election that history and many forecasters predicted would deliver a Republican wave, Democrats surprisingly held their own. The resulting GOP majority will be a narrow one, with the Senate remaining in Democrats\u2019 hands. The Oct. 28 attack on Paul Pelosi, the Speaker\u2019s husband of 59 years, influenced her decision to remain in Congress, but not in the way many people thought. \u201cIt was not, \u2018Oh, well, since they did that, I can\u2019t even think of something else,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cNo, it had the opposite effect. I couldn\u2019t give them that satisfaction.\u201d Read More: Nancy Pelosi Doesn\u2019t Care What You Think Of Her. This steely tenaciousness, this refusal to let others decide her path, is a running theme of my biography of Pelosi. It has been the hallmark of her political career, from forcing her way into the male-dominated ranks of congressional leadership to standing up to former President Donald Trump. As the youngest child and only daughter of three-term Baltimore mayor Thomas D\u2019Alessandro, politics was in Pelosi\u2019s blood; she first set foot on the House floor as a young child, when her father was serving in Congress. But when she finally ran for office herself at the age of 47\u2014after raising five children and serving for decades as a political fundraiser, strategist and volunteer\u2014it was from a different coast, under a different name, with a political identity all her own. Deanne Fitzmaurice\u2014San Francisco Chronicle/Getty ImagesNancy Pelosi at election headquarters on primary election night, on April 7, 1987. Ask Pelosi about her legacy, and the first thing she\u2019ll mention is the Affordable Care Act. However flawed and incomplete the 2010 law\u2019s guarantee of universal access to health care may have proven, it represented the fulfillment of a century of liberal aspirations, and the pinnacle of Pelosi\u2019s legislative craft. She moved mountains to get it through the House, at one point nearly breaking down in tears as she begged a group of liberal feminists to swallow an unsavory compromise on abortion funding. Then, after a special election robbed Democrats of their supermajority in the Senate, she urged then-President Obama not to give up on the historic legislation. \u201cIf the gate\u2019s closed, you go over the fence,\u201d she said at the time. \u201cIf the fence is too high, we\u2019ll pole-vault in. If that doesn\u2019t work, we\u2019ll parachute in. But we\u2019re going to get health-care reform passed for the American people.\u201d Though most of the drama around the bill\u2019s passage revolved around the Senate, it never could have happened without Pelosi\u2019s determination and drive. Win McNamee\u2014Getty ImagesSpeaker of the House Nancy Pelosi stands behind President Barack Obama as he signs the Affordable Health Care for America Act during a ceremony with fellow Democrats in the East Room of the White House on March 23, 2010. She did it knowing there might be a political cost, and indeed there was. Republicans gained 63 seats in the House in the 2010 midterm elections, an election in which Pelosi was a central figure. Republicans made her the subject of millions of dollars\u2019 worth of attack ads across the country, capitalizing on their base\u2019s visceral loathing of her and giving Peosi unusual prominence for a congressional leader. But Pelosi believed in gaining power not for its own sake but in order to do something with it. Obamacare is part of a legacy that includes two decades of liberal policy victories, from allowing gay people to serve openly in the military to the historic climate investments of this year\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act. \u201cThis is a very difficult job,\u201d she told us. \u201cYou have to really know how to be a legislator.\u201d These legislative successes were all the more remarkable for the era in which they came. Faced with unrelenting Republican opposition, she held together the diverse Democratic caucus and drove a hard bargain in negotiations across the aisle. After Donald Trump became president, she led her party back to power, becoming Speaker for the second time in 2019 in the middle of a government shutdown over border-wall funding. Pelosi refused to budge, and Trump soon capitulated. She would go on to impeach him twice while simultaneously negotiating with his Administration to secure trillions in COVID-19 relief funding.

Pelosi rejects the notion that she bears any blame for the toxic state of politics. \u201cI don\u2019t take any responsibility for what the Republicans have done to the Congress. This is not about gridlock,\u201d she says. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about some sort of equivalence between Democrats and Republicans. They are anti-science, anti-government, and that\u2019s where they are.\u201d The GOP\u2019s lack of decency was apparent in many Republicans\u2019 reaction to her husband\u2019s attack, Pelosi says. \u201cJust think if your spouse were in that situation and people would make a joke of it, like it was funny,\u201d she added. \u201cCollecting money for bail for the perpetrator, putting out a conspiracy theory about what it was about. It\u2019s so horrible to think that the Republican Party has come down to this.\u201d This attitude, she says, was part of what voters recoiled from the midterms. Mark Wilson\u2014Getty Images (2); Chip Somodevilla\u2014Getty Images; Jim Watson\u2014Pool/AFP/Getty Images Pelosi never groomed a successor, something for which she was often criticized. Ambitious Democrats languished for decades waiting for an opening in House leadership. She has often expressed the view that power is never given but must be taken by those who seek it. \u201cI didn\u2019t think that was the right approach, to anoint somebody,\u201d she told us Thursday. \u201cIt\u2019s really important for people to have the legitimacy that they were chosen by the members.\u201d A free-for-all appears unlikely. Pelosi\u2019s longtime deputy Steny Hoyer, a fellow Marylander who has known her since they worked for the same Senator in 1963, announced Thursday that he would also stay in Congress but not in leadership. Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York, the 52-year-old chair of the Democratic caucus, appears almost certain to win the minority leader position in the Democratic leadership elections scheduled for Nov. 30, becoming the first Black man to lead a party in Congress. The first woman Speaker, in passing the torch, will make history once again. Pelosi intends to spend the next two years in valedictory mode. \u201cMy life ahead is full of thank-yous,\u201d she says, to her constituents and all the others who have supported her over the years. She does not plan to serve on any committees and she does not want to serve as a sort of shadow speaker from the sidelines. \u201cThanksgiving is coming,\u201d she says. \u201cI have no intention of being the mother-in-law in the kitchen saying, \u2018My son doesn\u2019t like the stuffing that way, this is the way we make it in our family.\u2019 They will have their vision. They will have their plan. It\u2019s up to the caucus to decide which way they want to go.\u201d",

    "content": "The post How are Bitcoin Long-Term Holders Responding to the BTC Price Crash? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The Bitcoin price has continued to shrink in 2022 since Terra Luna initiated a significant crypto crash in Q1. The FTX and Alameda meltdown has stirred fresh selling pressure, which analysts expect to push through 2023. Moreover, confidence in centralized crypto exchanges has significantly slumped, which may push some to the insolvency route. According to our latest crypto price oracles, Bitcoin is trading around $16,500, up from the recent lows of $15,900. The digital asset is trading 76 percent down from its ATH, $69k, set approximately a year ago. Long-term Bitcoin critic Peter Schiff thinks Bitcoin price is yet to bottom per the current sentiments. Shiff highlighted a scenario where long-term Bitcoin holders sell their bags to sustain themselves\u2014adding that sooner than later, only long-term holders with sustainable paychecks will survive the shakeout. It didn't take long for this forecast to come true. The lion's share of the selling has not even started yet. #Bitcoin still has a long way to fall. https://t.co/dvNtGMIQHq\u2014 Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) November 17, 2022 Nonetheless, long-term Bitcoin holders are optimistic about the overall Btc market, which has significant adoption worldwide. Per on-chain data, long-term Bitcoin holders perceive the current bear market as similar to 2018 one. Glassnode explained: \u201cBitcoin Long-Term Holders are currently experiencing acute financial stress, holding an average of -33% in unrealized losses. This is comparable to the lows of the 2018 bear market, which saw a peak unrealized loss of -36% on average.\u201d Notably, Glassnode data shows that crypto exchanges recorded a sharp uptick in withdrawals toward non-custodial platforms. Reportedly, cryptocurrency exchanges have seen one of the most significant net declines in aggregate BTC balance in history, falling by 72.9k BTC in 7 days. Glassnode Further Notes on Bitcoin Market Outlook Bitcoin (BTC) is a legal tender to two countries -El Salvador and the African Central Republic \u2013 and is regulated as a digital asset in many other jurisdictions. With a hard cap of 21 million Bitcoins and a halving to reduce the overall supply over time, market strategists are optimistic about its long-term success.\u00a0 Nevertheless, global geopolitics and the prevailing macroeconomics continue to push Bitcoin prices to higher volatility. For instance, the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine has significantly divided international regulators on using Bitcoin and other crypto assets.\u00a0 Furthermore, western governments argue that Russia has used Bitcoin and other crypto assets to manoeuvre the set sanctions.\u00a0 However, with the rising global inflation rate, which has significantly reduced fiat currencies\u2019 purchasing power, Bitcoin and other digital assets are expected to record significant cash inflows.",

    "content": "The post Toon Finance DogeCoin Shiba Inu Coin Moon After Elon Musk Seals Twitter Purchase appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News In the past few months, there has been a great deal of discussion over so-called \u201cmeme coins\u201d like DOGE, of which Elon Musk claims to be a large admirer. Since his controversial purchase of Twitter, it has rocketed in popularity. What is a meme coin? A cryptocurrency that is based on or gets its inspiration from an online meme is called a meme coin. The most well-known example of a currency based on a meme is the DOGE, which was designed after the viral image of a Shiba Inu dog known as the \u201cDoge\u201d meme. Other examples of meme coins are UBQ and COIN, both of which are based on popular memes such as \u201cUbiquiti\u201d and \u201cBitcoin,\u201d respectively. The realm of virtual currencies is perpetually undergoing change, with new concepts and technology being presented on a consistent basis. The proliferation of meme coins is a relatively recent phenomenon in this sector.\u00a0 The Support of DOGEcoin by Elon Musk and What It Means for Investors in Cryptocurrencies Elon Musk, CEO of both Tesla and SpaceX, has been a prominent booster of DOGEcoin, which has led to a significant increase in the price of the cryptocurrency. It is possible that there is more to Musk\u2019s backing than meets the eye, despite the fact that some people assume he is just trying to capitalise on the current wave of excitement. In this article, we will discuss some of the reasons that Musk may have endorsed DOGEcoin, as well as what this support may represent for those who have invested in cryptocurrencies. There are a few different hypotheses to consider on the reasons why Elon Musk is such a vocal supporter of DOGEcoin. To begin, it is possible that he just really likes the coin, or that he has faith in its potential in the long run. Second, it is possible that he is trying to raise people\u2019s knowledge about cryptocurrencies in general and the potential that they have as an investment. The third possibility is that he is attempting to create a buzz in order to artificially inflate the price of DOGEcoin (and make a profit in the process). It is important to note that Musk is not the only celebrity to endorse DOGEcoin; other celebrities, such as Snoop Dogg and Gene Simmons, have also shown their support for the cryptocurrency. It is possible that the price of DOGEcoin is being driven even higher by the increased attention it is receiving from high-profile personalities. It is impossible to overlook Elon Musk\u2019s impact on the cryptocurrency market, regardless of whether you are an investor in cryptocurrencies or just someone who is inquisitive about the world of digital currencies. The price of the cryptocurrency has skyrocketed as a direct result of his public promotion of DOGEcoin.\u00a0 Some people assume that he is simply trying to capitalise on the buzz around the cryptocurrency; however, there may be more to his endorsement than meets the eye. The impact that Musk\u2019s continuous support will have on DOGEcoin and the cryptocurrency industry as a whole is something that can only be determined with the passage of time; nevertheless, one thing is certain: he is most certainly someone to keep an eye on. Toon Finance Decnetalized coins are beginning to attract media attention from all over the world as more and more celebrities from across the world enter the field of decentralised finance. Toon Finance is a brand new DEX platform that operates similarly to pancake swaps and will include support for the ERC20 blockchain. Toon Finance is a forward-thinking piece of software that has produced a sizable community of seasoned users, and anyone who is interested in joining the team can do so at no cost. Simply joining their Telegram channel and introducing yourself is all that is required of you at this point. Already having raised more than 2 million dollars in USD during the first week of their presale, Toon Finance is poised to become the Meme token of the year. After many months of planning and preparation, the long-delayed project can now be accessed by the general public. The following is a list of the distinguishing characteristics that set Toon Finance apart from other meme coins, such as Tamadoge and Shiba Inu: Uses the DEX Operating System as its base. The primary feature of the Toon Finance Protocol is that it is a decentralized exchange (DEX) platform. This is a unique characteristic because other meme coins on the market operate on centralized platforms. Toon Finance operates on the DEX to offer investors more security and peace of mind. One of the biggest advantages of the DEX system is that it does not have a central failure point that hackers can attack to harm the users. This is why investors can rest assured that their finances are safer. Another advantage of DEX is that it eliminates the need for a third party to act as a middleman in the transactions.

    "content": "ConsenSys, in collaboration with several crypto companies, is co-launching a climate platform for the world built on the Ethereum PoS consensus protocol. Regulatory authorities have constantly expressed their worries over the effects of crypto mining on the environment. The Ethereum-based software firm, ConsenSys, which played a crucial role in the completion of the much-publicized Merge, has teamed up with many other crypto firms to co-launch the Ethereum Climate Platform (ECP) during the ongoing global climate conference, dubbed COP27. The COP27 is a United Nations Climate Change Global Innovation Hub in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, from November 6\u201318. The climate platform is developed for the Ethereum network and aims to reduce the ecosystem\u2019s excess energy demand, which was the norm before the Merge two months ago. According to Joseph Lubin, co-founder of ConsenSys and a developer of the Ethereum blockchain, the motive is to raise some capital and invest it in high-impact technologies. Lubin stated that the team is expected to find funding for new projects that have technological significance and determine how impactful they will become. Upon the completion of the Merge, Ethereum discontinued its use of the energy-intensive proof-of-work (PoW) to the more energy-efficient proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus protocol. Ethereum, during the PoW stage, was powered by miners who completed several challenging puzzles to add more transactions to the ledger. With the PoS, Ethereum utilizes validators to facilitate transactions on the blockchain while using less energy. After the Merge, the network has drastically reduced its energy use by 99.9%. Part of Lubin\u2019s statement read: \u201cThe Ethereum Merge has raised the bar for reducing climate change across the broader sectors of the global economy. It shows that with a collective drive, technological innovations are possible without increasing carbon emissions.\u201d Rising Concerns about Crypto Mining Even before Ethereum\u2019s transition from the PoW to the PoS, digital asset mining has been the subject of increasing backlash from regulators and environmental activists. Accordingly, the European Commission revealed in October that it plans to ban crypto mining if the region faces a severe energy crisis in the coming winter. As expected, regulatory agencies like the European Union (EU) are proposing ways to reduce PoW activities within the bloc. In October, the European Commission told its member states to be ready to stop crypto mining. In addition, the commission proposes load shedding in the region\u2019s electricity supply as winter approaches. China has since taken a more extreme stance by banning Bitcoin mining and other crypto trading activities in 2021. Other PoW protocols, like Dogecoin and Zcash, also consider switching to PoS due to energy concerns. Ethereum has experienced a significant surge in its price after the Merge, with the network seeing close to a 10% increase. However, the gains were short-lived as ETH could not continue its upward trend 24 hours after the historic transition. ETH currently trades at $1,214 at the time of writing, per our data. However, the token is yet to respond to the latest development as the community hopes for a price increase towards the $2,000 level before the year ends.

    "description": "<p>The United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has publicly censured Mohammad Prodhan, the former Chief Executive Officer of Sonali Bank UK (SBUK), for failing to establish and maintain effective anti-money laundering (AML) systems and controls at the bank. </p><p>The financial markets regulator, which <a href=\"https://www.financemagnates.com/institutional-forex/regulation/sonali-bank-uk-ceo-fined-76400-for-money-laundering/\">fined Prodhan \u00a376,400 in 2018</a>, is now opting to several disapprove the ex-CEO as a result of \u201cexceptional circumstances in this case.\u201d</p><p>These situations include \"Mr Prodhan returning to Bangladesh and no longer having income or assets in the UK; the fact he is no longer in employment in Bangladesh; ongoing personal conditions which limit his ability to travel to the UK for the Upper Tribunal; and the length of time since his misconduct which has been impacted by Covid-delays to the litigation,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.financemagnates.com/tag/financial-conduct-authority/\" target=\"_blank\">FCA</a> explained in a statement <a href=\"https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/fca-issues-final-notice-former-ceo-anti-money-laundering-failings\">released</a> on Friday.</p><p>Furthermore, the financial watchdog noted the Bank of England\u2019s Prudential Regulation Authority has canceled the bank\u2019s authorization. The institution has also been renamed to Sonali Bangladesh (UK) Limited, it said. </p><p>SBUK was founded in 2001 to serve the Bangladeshi community in the United Kingdom. The bank is the product of a partnership between the Bangladesh government and Sonali Bank, a state-owned commercial bank in Bangladesh.</p><p>Prodhan's Offence</p><p>In 2018, the FCA penalized Prodhan for failing to take charge of his AML duties at the SBUK, leading to \u201csystemic failures in SBUK\u2019s AML systems and controls throughout the business.\u201d However, the CEO referred the case to the Upper Tribunal, a UK superior appellate court, where the case was delayed. </p><p>\u201cWhile a financial penalty was appropriate in this case, prolonged litigation to enforce a penalty that is unlikely to be paid against a person who may not be able to travel to the UK to explain himself in person to the Upper Tribunal is neither practical nor fair,\" noted Mark Steward, Executive Director of Enforcement and Market Oversight at the FCA. \"In these exceptional circumstances, a public censure is an appropriate resolution of the case,\u201d Steward added.</p><p>Meanwhile, in 2016, <a href=\"https://www.financemagnates.com/tag/bangladesh/\">Bangladesh</a> appointed Pradhan as the Managing Director of Rupali Bank, a state-owned commercial bank. In 2019, the executive was also selected as the MD of Sonali Bank in Bangladesh. However, FCA in the latest statement said Prodhan is no longer in employment in Bangladesh.</p> This article was written by Solomon Oladipupo at www.financemagnates.com.",

    "content": "Dennis Rodman is one of the raunchiest men in NBA history, but even his experiences didn\u2019t work all the time. Especially not the nights before NBA games. The Bulls legend made a name in the NBA for various reasons. He was notably known as the rebounding king of his time. It\u2019s why he earned the nickname, \u2018The Worm.\u2019 His tough brand of defense and hustle stemmed from his time with the Detroit Pistons, known as the \u2018Bad Boy Pistons.\u2019 He helped the Bulls win three straight championships from 1995 to 1998 after Jordan recruited him. Jordan regularly played the Pistons during their peak, so he knew exactly what he would be getting with Rodman on the team. The Pistons routinely harassed Jordan to the point where they coined the \u2018Jordan rules\u2019, a physical style of play meant to neutralize the greatest player in NBA history. \u201cThe Last Dance\u201d turned to Dennis Rodman, the \u201cBad Boys\u201d Pistons of the late 1980s, the Jordan Rules and the continued turbulence early in the 1997-98 Bulls\u2019 campaign.https://t.co/TJcC04CAYr \u2014 Sun-Times Sports (@suntimes_sports) April 27, 2020 Also Read: \u201cLeBron James just mocked his own LeLiar personality\u201d: Lakers star makes fun of his pathological lying while discussing LeRoy Butler\u2019s Lambeau Leap Dennis Rodman discussed how scandalous experiments before games never worked for him Rodman\u2019s career is defined more by his adventures outside the court than those on it, however. He was a wild man. Rodman loved partying, and he loved to have fun with women. However, for all his crazy stories, Rodman found his breaking point. Even the legendary Rodman had his limits. It was surprising for him, but in the end, he did come to a decision. He was talking to Mike Tyson on his show \u2018Hotboxin\u2019, when he said, \u201cI\u2019ve done this twice in my life playing sports and I never knew that this s**t will f**k with you when you\u2019re playing the game.\u201d What exactly was he referring to? \u201cI\u2019m trying to have s*x all night before the game. Doesn\u2019t f****ng work out too well.\u201d The routine affected his gameplay and his coach even had to talk to him to sort out the issues. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you take a night off? I know what you did last night. You got weak knees right?\u201d Rodman recalled his coach saying. Rodman married himself and earned a cool $10 million Dennis Rodman is a generally wild character, but there are some lengths he\u2019ll go to that will amaze people. Once he even married himself, and the entire stunt netted him a massive profit. Dennis Rodman has a net worth of $500,000 right now, and he once tried to increase that immensely. In 1996, Rodman appeared at his book signing for \u2018Bad as I wanna be\u2019 in a bridal gown and a horse-drawn carriage. The whole thing was done to promote his book, and it worked. The book was a bestseller for several months, and in the end Rodman revealed that he earned $10 million from the entire thing. What a way to earn money, but of course, it\u2019s only Rodman who could do something like this.

    "content": "The post Top 5 Altcoins Which May Undergo a 10x Rally in 2023! appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin price appears to be in hot waters right now as it has lost a significant amount of investor base and also the trust. The resulting volatility has compelled the investors to move out of the platform, which has caused a significant financial loss in recent times. Hence, market participants are now hunting for potential altcoins that may undergo a 10x rally. Below mentioned are the potential altcoins for 2023: Ethereum Ethereum is the second largest asset after Bitcoin, sharing a significant market cap with the crypto space. With the launch of ETH 2.0, the asset displayed enough strength to remain above the crucial support zones in times of bear markets. However, the current market conditions have driven the ETH price down, but with a slight change in the bearish market sentiments, the price may rebound nicely to revive the bullish trend. XRP XRP price had begun to gain traction within the market as the analysts and the influencers believed the crypto\u2019s victory against the SEC could be imminent. Moreover, the asset\u2019s value has been extensively bearish or stagnant for a prolonged period and hence is believed to rebound well when the lawsuit settles down. Therefore, the year 2023 could bring decent returns for the asset that may trigger many other cryptos. Binance Coin Binance Coin is the third largest cryptocurrency after Bitcoin & Ethereum, excluding stablecoins, which have maintained a decent rally from the beginning. The asset rose to new heights without any noise and currently manifests huge strength. Therefore, the BNB price is assumed to rise significantly in the coming days and lay down a firm upswing since the beginning of 2023. Dogecoin Dogecoin, despite losing a huge user base due to the unfamous market crash in 2021, maintained its dominance. Hence is trading within the top 10 cryptos according to the market capitalization. The asset is believed to rebound finely as the market conditions stabalize and quickly reclaim the lost levels. In 2023, the DOGE price is expected to maintain a significant upswing and rise higher. Polygon Polygon\u2019s price has been incremental despite the bearish market sentiments and displays enough strength. The price presently appears to be strong and may resume with a firm upswing in the coming days. Once the MATIC price settles above $1, it may be easy for the asset to maintain a notable upswing in the coming days.",

    "content": "The post Big Eyes Coin Falls Short Toon Finance Slaughters ICO Presale Stage One 2.75 MIL appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News ICO Presale Fun Toonie Takeover It has been an extremely busy year in the world of cryptocurrency. Over 300 million people now trade cryptocurrencies while daily transactions now easily surpass the $100bn mark. Unsurprisingly, a glut of new digital tokens has entered the market, taking the total number of unique cryptocurrencies to over 20,000 and counting in 2022. However, some perform better than others. While investors in any environment would gladly take a slice of good fortune, the digital assets that perform well are not determined by luck alone. Far from it. Right now, Big Eyes Coin is at real risk of being one of the year\u2019s big losers while Toon Finance has emerged as one of the top assets to hold in 2023. Here\u2019s why. Big Eyes Coin falls short Toon Finance leads With its cute kitty-based token, Big Eyes launched its pre-sale phase with high hopes of matching the success of DogeCoin and other popular meme coins but with almost instant results at launch. While the platform has yet to officially launch its BIG coin, signs of potential shortcomings have already emerged. At a glance, Big Eyes is doing fine. With 3589.74 BIG tokens equating to $1, the company has successfully raised over $9.7m of its $10,700,000.00 presale ICO target. Meanwhile, the token can be purchased through USD payments or popular digital currencies like ETH and BNB. Confirmation that it will be available on Uniswap is another positive development. Big Eyes is a DeFi economy that is powered by the Ethereum blockchain and delivers safe, fast, and decentralized transactions in an accessible, user-friendly, and innovative fashion. On the act of things, the opportunity to embrace a cute meme coin from launch stands out as an ideal introduction to crypto investments for new investors as well as a low-risk portfolio booster for experienced investors. However, when you scratch beneath the surface, Big Eyes Coin has already underperformed by failing to sell out its pre-sale allocation while even its $250 competition has yet to transform the fortunes of the token.\u00a0 Big Eyes has brought some intrigue to the industry while the fluffy, cartoon images are equally as impressive as those used by the dog-related meme coins. However, a difficult year for DOGE and Shiba Inu \u2013 which has fallen from $0.000079 in late October 2021 to under $0.00001 \u2013 will undoubtedly cause concern regarding the long-term prospects of any meme coin. The market is recovering from the crash but global economic difficulties will inevitably cause hesitation from investors when it comes to acting purely on speculation. In a world where information is available at our fingertips, people rightly want to scrutinize investments to validate their choices. Furthermore, many analysts predict that a repeat of those exponential bull runs of 2021 simply cannot be repeated by coins that rely on novelty alone.\u00a0 Ultimately, the potential of Big Eyes to spark some interest is clear, but the big question is \u201cthen what?\u201d. The answer is, sadly, \u201cnothing\u201d. Aside from the fact that investments will contribute to the platform\u2019s 5% charity donation, the BIG token is just a fun digital asset with no real purpose. There lies the problem. Toon Finance is set to combine novelty with function The ability of meme coins to attract investors and take crypto into the public consciousness has been a driving force in the new era of cryptocurrency investments. While the ship for novelty alone may have passed \u2013 especially when looking at the forecasts for BIG before it has even launched \u2013 it has shown the demand for accessibility as the appeal of investments continues to expand beyond blockchain supporters to a wide range of demographics. Another upcoming token currency in its pre-sale phase is Toon Finance. And by combining the novelty aspects with genuine long-term function, it looks set to enjoy a phenomenal 2023 with many analysts forecasting a major bull run shortly after its official launch on January, 1. Having only launched its pre-sale phase in the second week of October, Toon Finance has sold an impressive $2.75m worth of its native TFI coin. Moreover, its ICO has been included on CoinMarketCap, Crypto.com, and KuCoin. Interest in the digital token is further highlighted by the fact that it has become the most searched-for asset on CoinMarketCap. The fun cartoon mascots certainly capture the attention but the early success and long-term prospects of Toon Fi is primarily attributed to its function within the context of the Toon Finance metaverse. The P2E platform is geared towards gamers with the Space Battle Grounds arena allowing players to compete against other members of the growing community through a range of games. Lotteries and other fun initiatives ensure that the digital space will be a truly immersive experience for members. Toon Finance is technically a meme coin as it was named after a meme. However, the platform has a serious application and is about far more than its native token, but its success will surely open the door to significant growth. Having already outperformed Big Cat and TAMAdodge, which also had a positive start before losing some momentum, TFI is the hottest token due for an imminent release. New digital assets are the way to go in 2023 After a difficult 2022 for the crypto industry \u2013 as well as real-world investments \u2013 2023 promises to be far more pleasing. Embracing ICOs and early launch investments could signal the perfect opportunity for investors to reach their short and long-term financial objectives. Not least because there is a chance to build a diverse portfolio thanks to the low purchase prices involved.\u00a0 The landscape is changing as the top new digital tokens will combine the best features of meme coins with those of utility coins to provide genuine function. Whether ToonFi or other new tokens can emulate the boom of 2021 remains to be seen, but it is clear that there is a potential for huge ROIs. After seeing how quickly things can change, though, early investments will be the key to maximized returns. Once a prime candidate has been found, now is the time to join the party. The ICO Presale \u2013 What is it and should you participate? An ICO presale is a period of time before the main ICO event when a project sells tokens to strategic investors at a discounted price. This is usually done in order to raise funds to finance the main ICO event. If you\u2019re thinking of participating in an ICO presale, there are a few things you should know. In this blog post, we\u2019ll cover what an ICO presale is, how it works, and whether or not you should participate in one.\u00a0 What is an ICO Presale?\u00a0 An ICO presale (also sometimes called a private sale or pre-ICO) is a period of time before the main ICO event when a project sells tokens to strategic investors at a discounted price. This is usually done in order to raise funds to finance the main ICO event.\u00a0 During an ICO presale, a project will offer tokens at a significantly lower price than they will during the main ICO event. For example, if the main ICO event price for 1 token is $1, the project might offer tokens during the presale at $0.50 each. The aim of this is to attract larger investors who are willing to commit more money upfront in exchange for a discount.\u00a0 It\u2019s important to note that not all projects hold an ICO presale \u2013 some only have a main ICO event. And not all projects that do have an ICO presale make it open to the public. In some cases, the presale may be invitation-only and only available to accredited investors.\u00a0 How Does an ICO Presale Work?\u00a0 If you\u2019re interested in participating in an ICO presale, there are usually two ways you can go about it. The first is through an exchange and the second is directly through the project\u2019s website.\u00a0 If you choose to participate through an exchange, you\u2019ll need to create an account and deposit funds into it. Once you\u2019ve done that, you\u2019ll be able to buy tokens during the ICO presale at the specified price.\u00a0 Should You Participate in anICO Presale? Whether or not you should participate in anICO presale depends on a few factors. Firstly, do your research on the project and make sure you believe in its long-term viability. Secondly, consider whether or not you\u2019re comfortable with taking on more risk \u2013 remember that as with any investment, there\u2019s always a chance you could lose your money entirely. And finally, make sure you understand how much money you\u2019re willing to invest and stick to that budget \u2013 don\u2019t get caught up in FOMO (fear of missing out) and end up investing more than you can afford to lose!\u00a0 Toon Finance / TFT Twitter / Toon Finance Telegram Disclaimer: This is a press release post.

    "content": "The post Bitcoin (BTC) Price Stuck in Rut: Here\u2019s What Traders Can Expect This Weekend appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The bankruptcy filing by the crypto exchange giant FTX has created a black hole in the crypto space as the market has lost billions of dollars due to the FTX crash. However, it may mark the birth of a fresh bullish start for the crypto market by Q1 of 2023 as it sets a new goal for leading assets to bounce back to unexpected price levels. As the macro conditions of the traditional market improve, Bitcoin tends to fade its bottom levels by skyrocketing to a bullish territory.\u00a0 Bitcoin To Ignore Its Consolidated Zone Soon! The crypto sector, which once promised the community and investors decentralization and trust, now has turned out to be a joke, ending up with authoritarianism after FTX\u2019s demise. However, Bitcoin seems to continue its legacy and lead the market to the North as it aims to initiate an upward rally by next week. Trading View A well-known crypto analyst, Matthew Dixon, the CEO of Evai, predicts that Bitcoin may extend its current consolidation trend for the next few days. According to him, Bitcoin may break its ongoing consolidated price range if it exceeds the price level of $17K. He further predicts that BTC may form an upward triangle pattern in the price chart with two tops between the price range of $17.6K and $17.4K. Bitcoin may project itself with a smooth run to $19.5K if it surpasses its resistance at $17.6K by the next week. What Lies Ahead For Bitcoin? The FTX\u2019s downfall is similar to previous bearish events like Mt Gox in 2014, and it may raise concerns about centralization and centralized exchanges. Hence, Bitcoin has a high chance of standing out as it works in a decentralized nature, forcing users to trust self-custodian wallets rather than centralized exchanges. Looking at the daily price chart, the Bitcoin market has reached a short-term consolidation range as the BTC price has been hovering around the $16K-$17K range from the last week. Bitcoin currently trades at $16.5K after it faced rejection again at $17K today.\u00a0 The RSI-14 indicator has no sign of improvement as it continues to trend in an overselling zone of the 36-level. However, the MACD line seems to change its mood as it starts trading parallelly with the current trend without dropping further below its signal line. Bitcoin price is currently building a short-term momentum which may test an immediate support level at $16,350. If BTC fails to hold its price near $16K, it can soon aim for a breakout below its 23.6% Fib retracement, plunging hard to $14.5K. However, an upward retracement is expected if BTC makes a bullish reversal after testing the $16,350 support level. A breakout above its Bollinger band\u2019s upper limit, which is near the EMA-20 trend line at $17.9K, may spark fresh surges in the price chart, and Bitcoin can next make an attempt to break its strong resistance at $20K.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0",

    "description": "The decision to freeze Shin\u2019s asset worth over $104 million was approved by the Seoul Southern District Court, which was based on a request from the prosecutors.",
    "content": "While crypto exchange FTX stole the limelight from other fallen ecosystems, South Korean authorities continue their efforts to bring closure to the victims of the year\u2019s first crypto crash \u2014 Terraform Labs. Nearly six months after the Terra (LUNA) blockchain was officially halted , South Korean authorities froze approximately $104.4 million (140 billion won) from co-founder Shin Hyun-seong based on suspicion of unfair profits. The decision to freeze Shin\u2019s asset worth over $104 million was approved by the Seoul Southern District Court, which was based on a request from the prosecutors. The claim related to Shin\u2019s involvement in selling pre-issued Terra ( LUNA ) tokens to unwary investors. Based on suspicion of profiting from unwarranted LUNA sales, the district court froze the allegedly stolen funds until further investigations are underway, reported local news media YTN. \u201cReports that CEO Shin Hyun-seong sold Luna at a high point and realized profits or that he made profits through other illegal methods are not true,\u201d Cointelegraph previously quoted Shin\u2019s attorney . The preindictment preservation of the funds is a way of preventing bad actors from disposing of stolen funds and causing more financial damage or losses for the investors. Shin is currently being investigated by South Korean authorities on two charges \u2014 making unfair profits from issuing in-house tokens LUNA and TerraUSD (UST) and leaking customer transaction information of Chai \u2014 a Korean payment app linked to Terra \u2014 to Terraform Labs. On November 14, the South Korean prosecutors requested the accused co-founder appear in court as part of an investigation into the firm's collapse. Related: Terra Labs, Luna Guard commission audit to defend against allegations of misusing funds In the first week of November, the prosecutors accused Terra co-founder Do Kwon of manipulating Terra\u2019s price. \"It's highly disappointing to see the Korean prosecutors continue to try to contort the Capital Markets Act to fit their agenda and push baseless claims. Prior judicial decisions and statements by the Korean financial authorities, including the FSC, establish that cryptocurrency tokens are not investment contract securities,\" said Terraform Labs spokesperson in a written statement to Cointelegraph.",

Recently, the exchange was reportedly \u201chacked\u201d and more than $600 million in funds were squeezed out. Meanwhile, many believed it was the job of an insider as the stolen funds were quickly converted into Ethereum & stablecoins. In a fresh update, SBF has reportedly received a portion of $420 million in funds into his personal account. FTX raised $420 million in funding in October last year to improve the user experience and be more in line with regulators. Interestingly, nearly 75% of the total amount was sent to SBF. The October 2021 funding round valued FTX exchange at $25 billion and raised money from investors like BlackRock, Tiger Global, and Singapore\u2019s sovereign wealth fund Temasek & Sequoia Capital. Later, after a couple of months, some of these investors helped raise $400 million for FTX\u2019s subsidiary at an $8 billion valuation. During the time funds were raised, the crypto markets were booming and the Alameda was highly profitable. While it is still unclear what SBF did with the $300 million, whether it was poured back to FTX or kept separate, Meanwhile, FTX\u2019s 2021 audited financial statements said the money was being reserved by the company for \u2018operational expediency\u2019 on behalf of the related party.",

On November 11, the platform filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.

Sullivan & Cromwell, a Wall Street law firm, has been hired by FTX as outside legal assistance in bankruptcy proceedings and criminal investigations.\u00a0 The exchange contacted the legal firm as its liquidity problem grew \u201cincreasingly grave,\u201d according to court documents. According to FTX and its extensive network of affiliated businesses, which includes trading firm Alameda Research, its assets and liabilities are between $10 billion and $50 billion.\u00a0 Bankman-Fried\u2019s assets, which were previously valued at $16 billion, have been destroyed.\u00a0 A class action lawsuit against Bankman-Fried and numerous famous exchange promoters was also filed on Thursday, accusing them of engaging in fraud against \u201cunsophisticated investors.\u201d\u00a0 On behalf of investors, the Moskowitz Law Firm and Boies Schiller filed a case alleging that Bankman-Fried violated U.S. securities laws and caused approximately $11 billion in damages.

    "description": "Amid its ongoing battle with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Ripple has announced that it is seeking to expand its presence in the European Union (EU). In an interview with CNBC earlier this week, Stuart Alderoty, General Counsel for Ripple, said that \u201ceffectively, Ripple is operating outside of the U.S.\u201d as it stands due to its ongoing legal woes with the SEC. He added: Essentially, its customers and its revenue are all driven outside of the U.S., even though we still have a lot of employees inside of the U.S. Whilst it patiently awaits the outcome of its lawsuit, Ripple is planning to expand its presence in Europe. The firm already has two employees working on the ground in the Republic of Ireland and is seeking a virtual asset service provider (VASP) license from the Irish Central Bank so that it can \u201cpassport\u201d its offerings throughout the EU via an entity based there. The company also plans to file an application for an electronic money license in the country \u201cshortly.\u201d Alderoty said that he expects a ruling on the case against Ripple which has been going on since 2020 very soon, adding that \u201cwe are at the beginning of the end of the process in our case.\u201d. The SEC filed a lawsuit against the company alleging that the firm and its executives illegally sold XRP tokens, a cryptocurrency created in 2012 by the firm\u2019s founders, to investors without first registering the token as a security. The company denies claims that XRP is a security, arguing that the token should not be considered an investment contract and is used in its business to facilitate cross-border transactions between banks and financial institutions. Ripple Plans to Expand in Anticipation of MiCA Ripple\u2019s plans to expand into the EU are driven by anticipation of the zone\u2019s Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulations coming into effect within a few years. The regulatory framework was passed by EU lawmakers earlier in the year and seeks to align rules regarding crypto assets across the region. Beyond the EU, Ripple has also made the United Kingdom a priority by releasing a white paper with a set of guidelines outlining how it thinks Britain should regulate cryptocurrencies.

    "description": "FIFA president Gianni Infantino lashed out at Western critics of the Qatar World Cup\u2014sparking more controversy on the eve of the event",
    "content": "On the eve of signature sporting events, athletic administrators often address the media, as a sort of \u201cstate-of-the-union\u201d affair to address a league\u2019s accomplishments and concerns. Before the Super Bowl and NBA Finals, for example, commissioners of the NFL and NBA speak to the press, take some questions from reporters, and either offer direct answers or spin as they see fit. It\u2019s an almost ceremonial exercise. The goal: mollify the media before everyone moves onto the big games. On Saturday in Doha, FIFA president Gianni Infantino offered a new twist on this ritual. Instead of ushering in the Qatar World Cup, which begins on Sunday, Infantino gave an extraordinary speech, full of grievances about media examinations of the host country\u2019s human rights record, whataboutism, and what can best be described as an awkward attempt to compare his personal backstory to disenfranchised populations across the globe. (At worst, his remarks were highly offensive). [time-brightcove not-tgx=\u201dtrue\u201d] Infantino badly conflated examination with provocation. CNN labeled the speech an \u201cexplosive tirade.\u201d If anything, the immediate negative response to Infantino\u2019s press conference shined further light on the problems surrounding this 2022 World Cup, and undercut his own plea to keep the focus on football, to stick to sports. Infantino scored a spectacular own-goal for his own World Cup. Near the beginning of his sprawling hour-long address, Infantino said, \u201cToday I feel Qatari. Today I feel Arabic. Today I feel African. Today I feel gay. Today I feel disabled. Today I feel (like) a migrant worker. \u201cOf course I am not Qatari, I am not an Arab, I am not African, I am not gay, I am not disabled. But I feel like it, because I know what it means to be discriminated, to be bullied, as a foreigner in a foreign country. As a child I was bullied \u2013 because I had red hair and freckles, plus I was Italian so imagine.\u201d Infantino grew up in Switzerland. He said he feels like a migrant worker. Infantino made a $3.2 million in 2019. \u201cWhat do you do then?\u201d Infantino said. \u201cYou try to engage, make friends. Don\u2019t start accusing, fighting, insulting, you start engaging. And this is what we should be doing.\u201d (READ MORE: Meet The 22-Year-Old Star Who Could Make Team USA A World Cup Contender) Summoning the familiar whatabout deflection to which we\u2019ve become all too accustomed in political discourse, Infantino suggested that Western countries were in no position to criticize Qatar, given the human rights shortcomings in Europe and elsewhere. \u201cWe have told many, many lessons from some Europeans, from the western world,\u201d Infantino said. \u201cI think for what we Europeans have been doing the last 3,000 years we should be apologizing for next 3,000 years before starting to give moral lessons to people.\u201d True, every nation is far from perfect. But Infantino seemed to forget that he leads an organization that was embroiled in a bribery scandal when it awarded the World Cup to Qatar in 2010. (Though Infantino was not head of FIFA at the time). That thousands of migrant workers have died in Qatar over the past decade, many because of poor working conditions made more perilous by excessive heat. That FIFA made a conscious decision to hold a World Cup in Qatar. Questions are more than fair game. For Infantino to suggest criticism of Qatar is \u201cjust hypocrisy\u201d could not be more hypocritical. Infantino also looked to the disabled population to make his case for media hypocrisy. \u201cI was at an event a few days ago when we explained what we\u2019re doing at this World Cup for disabled people,\u201d Infantino said. He noted that there were around 400 journalists at his press conference on Saturday, but just four at that event. \u2018There [are] one billion disabled people in the world,\u201d he said. \u201cOne billion disabled people. Nobody cares.\u201d Infantino summoned some self-pity for FIFA, an organization that has earned none. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy, everyday and everyday to read all these critics,\u201d he said. He also lectured the press on how they should do their job going forward. \u201cIf you need to criticize somebody, don\u2019t criticize the players,\u201d Infantino said. \u201cDon\u2019t put pressure on the players, don\u2019t put pressure on the coaches. Let them concentrate on making their fans happy.\u201d His words were met with swift condemnation. Nicholas McGeehan, director of FairSquare, a non-profit human rights organization, called Infantino\u2019s speech \u201ccrass.\u201d \u201cIn brushing aside legitimate human rights criticisms, Gianni Infantino is dismissing the enormous price paid by migrant workers to make his flagship tournament possible \u2013 as well as FIFA\u2019s responsibility for it,\u201d Steve Cockburn, Amnesty International\u2019s Head of Economic and Social Justice, said in a statement. \u201cDemands for equality, dignity and compensation cannot be treated as some sort of culture war \u2013 they are universal human rights that FIFA has committed to respect in its own statutes.\u201d Infantino did announce that FIFA would start a legacy fund to follow this World Cup. \u201cThis cannot be mere window dressing, however,\u201d said Cockburn. \u201cIf FIFA is to salvage anything from this tournament, it must announce that it will invest a significant part of the $6 billion the organization will make from this tournament and make sure this fund is used to compensate workers and their families directly.\u201d Let\u2019s hope Infantino\u2019s actions after the World Cup rank better than his performance before it.

    "content": "The post PancakeSwap Will List ORY In December \u2013 Is Oryen Listing On WazirX, Binance, Or KuCoin After Its Presale? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Many cryptocurrency projects have recently struggled to raise prices to more desirable levels. However, Oryen (ORY), a new cryptocurrency with an ongoing presale, is breaking the trend. The project has commenced phase four of the presale with new records of 120% returns for early investors. At this rate, Oryen might become one of the market\u2019s top cryptocurrencies once it lists on PancakeSwap, WazirX, Binance, and KuCoin, as rumored after the presale phase. Oryen (ORY) Oryen, the most intriguing cryptocurrency project on Binance Smart Chain, is currently in presale. Investing in this project allows token holders to get the most steady passive income. A fixed annual percentage yield (APY) of 90% is offered by Oryen, which is higher than the APYs of other staking protocols and remains constant regardless of market conditions. Oryen aims to automate and simplify staking while providing its users with high yields. Thus, it uses the Oryen Autostaking Technic (OAT), which enables immediate and secure auto-staking. Holders of ORY have nothing else to do than wait for their hourly rewards to land directly into their wallets. In addition, the project uses Risk-Free Value (RFV), a separate wallet that ensures the stability of the ORY price. It has a reserve to support and maintain constant reward payouts during challenging market periods. PancakeSwap PancakeSwap is one of the biggest decentralized exchanges and a household name on the Binance Smart Chain. It will be Oryen\u2019s first step to list on the DEX on the 30th of December before it potentially lists on any centralized exchange afterward. WazirX (WRX) WazirX is the largest and fastest-growing cryptocurrency exchange in India. Under the umbrella of Binance, it offers INR trading pairs for more than 200 crypto assets. Reportedly, Oryen\u2019s team is currently approaching the exchange in anticipation of its launch in late December. This move would open ORY to a vast market of more than 100 million Indian investors. The Bottom Line Oryen is surpassing investors\u2019 expectations with an astonishing 120% price increase since the presale started. Moreover, the rumored exchange listings might give the staking platform the powder it needs to enter the realm of the top 100 cryptocurrencies.

    "description": "Naomi Biden and Neal exchanged \u201cI do's\u201d during a nippy late-morning ceremony",
    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Joe Biden \u2018s granddaughter Naomi Biden and her fiance, Peter Neal, were married Saturday in just the 19th wedding in the history of the White House. Naomi Biden and Neal exchanged \u201cI do\u2019s\u201d during a nippy late-morning ceremony \u2014 temperatures were in the low 40s \u2014 on the South Lawn, which was turned into a wedding venue for the very first time. It\u2019s the first White House wedding with a president\u2019s granddaughter as the bride. Scores of white folding chairs dotted a portion of the South Lawn, and the South Portico of the White House, facing the lawn and the Washington Monument in the distance, was decorated with wreaths and garland bearing white flowers. There was no tent. Guests began arriving hours before the ceremony, with some women opting for open-toed shoes despite the chill. [time-brightcove not-tgx=\u201dtrue\u201d] The public is seeing none of the festivities, unlike some past White House weddings. The bride and groom decided to keep journalists out, although the ceremony was outdoors on the grounds of what the president and first lady call the \u201cpeople\u2019s house.\u201d Naomi Biden, 28, is a lawyer in Washington. Her parents are Hunter Biden, the son of the president and first lady Jill Biden, and Kathleen Buhle, Hunter\u2019s first wife. Neal, 25, of Jackson Hole, Wyoming, recently graduated from the University of Pennsylvania law school. He works at Georgetown University Law Center in Washington. His parents are Drs. Mary C. and William \u201cBill\u201d C. Neal of Jackson Hole. The couple, who have been living at the White House, was set up by a mutual friend about four years ago in New York City and have been together ever since, the White House said. Neal proposed in September 2021 near his childhood home in Jackson Hole with a ring that repurposed the band of his grandmother\u2019s engagement ring, according to the White House. After the 20-somethings officially became husband and wife, their families and the wedding party were getting out of the cold and heading back inside the White House for lunch, which is to be followed in the evening by a dessert-and-dancing reception, according to a person familiar with the planning who was not authorized to publicly discuss the wedding schedule. Few other details were released before the ceremony. To accommodate public interest, the president and first lady planned to issue a statement and release photos after the first of their six grandchildren tied the knot, the White House said. President Biden and the first lady were among those who attended the wedding rehearsal dinner Friday at the Renwick Gallery steps from the White House. Neal\u2019s parents hosted. The Biden family will pay for all wedding activities, White House officials have said. \u201cThe wedding of Naomi Biden and Peter is a private one,\u201d Karine Jean-Pierre, the president\u2019s chief spokesperson, said Friday. \u201cIt\u2019s a family event and Naomi and Peter have asked that their wedding be closed to the media and we are respecting their wishes.\u201d There have been 18 documented weddings in the 200-plus-year history of the White House. Nine involved a president\u2019s daughter, most recently Richard Nixon\u2019s daughter Tricia in 1971 and Lyndon Johnson\u2019s daughter Lynda in 1967. But nieces, a grandniece, a son and first ladies\u2019 siblings have also gotten married there. One president, Grover Cleveland, tied the knot at the White House, too, while in office. Some of the weddings were open to coverage by the news media, while others weren\u2019t at all. Journalists were allowed into Tricia Nixon\u2019s wedding to Ed Cox, the first wedding held in the Rose Garden. Her wedding planner \u2014 a three-ring black binder in the offices of the White House Historical Association \u2014 includes extensive notes on the media plan. But the May 1994 wedding of a brother of then-first lady Hillary Clinton and the daughter of then-U.S. Sen. Barbara Boxer \u2014 the first since Tricia Nixon\u2019s marriage \u2014 was closed to the press. Clinton\u2019s spokesperson commented afterward and the White House released a photo. It was the same for the October 2013 wedding of Pete Souza, President Barack Obama\u2019s official photographer, and his longtime partner, Patti Lease. The White House announced the wedding in a statement following the small, private wedding in the Rose Garden. The White House Correspondents Association, which advocates for press access to the White House and the president, said it was \u201cdeeply disappointed\u201d that the White House declined its request for press coverage of Naomi Biden\u2019s wedding. \u201cWhite House weddings have been covered by the press throughout history and the first family\u2019s wish for privacy must be balanced against the public\u2019s interest in an event occurring at the People\u2019s House with the president as a participant,\u201d the WHCA board said in a statement. Stewart McLaurin, president of the White House Historical Association, said it\u2019s important to remember that first families are families first and foremost. \u201cTheir privacy should be respected, their wishes should be respected,\u201d he said. The wedding is just one half of a big weekend for the Biden family. The president\u2019s 80th birthday is Sunday and family members in town will celebrate him at a brunch hosted by the first lady.",

The current Princess of Wales chatted with several families who had to flee their homeland following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. </p> <p>Body language expert Darren Stanton analyzed footage from Kate\u2019s visit and said she displayed several \u201csubmissive\u201d gestures which indicated that she had a genuine interest in being there and supporting the Ukrainian families. </p> <p>Speaking on behalf of <a href=\"http://www.slingo.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Slingo</a>, Stanton observed: \u201cWe saw Kate interacting with children by sitting at the table where they were coloring in leaning forward and lowering her height in a submissive gesture. It\u2019s designed to build rapport with children because when someone is at their height they\u2019re more inclined to think \u2018this is someone like me\u2019 as opposed to someone standing over them. </p> <p>\u201cShe also unconsciously raises her hand to a chin, this is what we call evaluation or analysis so it shows that she is deeply interested in what those she is interacting with are doing and saying, and also the fact she is authentic, it is not a contrived or deliberate action. The body language denotes she really wants to be there and she\u2019s happy.\u201d</p> <figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\"> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The inspirational work of the Reading Ukrainian Community Centre is non-stop, and it\u2019s changing lives!<br> <br>Providing practical advice on employment and housing, delivering educational classes for children and building social connections, the centre is at the heart of the community. <a href=\"https://t.co/tn1Vrk846L\">pic.twitter.com/tn1Vrk846L</a></p>\u2014 The Prince and Princess of Wales (@KensingtonRoyal) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KensingtonRoyal/status/1593250839401230337?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 17, 2022</a></blockquote><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script> </div></figure> <p>Stanton added: \u201cWhen she spoke to an older gentleman at the center, he had his hands behind his back in an authoritative gesture and she placed her hands in front of her.

The regrouping of the bulls at $0.022 will give them the advantage to reclaim their ground in the market. pressure in the early part of today\u2019s trading session, there were reactions on both the upper band and the lower band of the Bollinger indicator. This means bulls are still strong to drive the price upward. They are holding firmly to their new support price level. Now at around the latest trading sessions, we noticed the contraction of the upper and lower band of the indicator. This signals a bullish breakout as both the forces of demand and the forces of supply get evenly matched From this point of view, we can see that support level remains a strong brick wall. The bearish price continues to be rejected as several attempts were made to bring the price lower than this level. With such a strong support price level like this one, the price of TAMA is expected to have a strong bullish price breakout. The price is expected soon to hit $0.0024. Tamadoge has a fully transparent 10-year plan, and to achieve its goals, They have employed a seasoned development team to make sure they deliver on all its promises.",

    "content": "The went on a steep price dive on November 8 after the price hits $0.28. It was almost like a unanimous decision by traders to take profits at the height of that price level. In two days the price decline hits $0.15. This was the support price level from where the market price began to rebound. Now as the price of the market nears the $0.28 price level, the price was rejected and in today\u2019s market, the price goes the bullish way After a support level was secured at $0.15, the bull market faced rejection at $0.228. But because the force behind the trend is still strong, it resumed its upside journey until it came to $0.28. The bearish move in today\u2019s market has a strong outlook. But its progress remains pegged at around the $0.25 price level. If the demand force behind the market trend remains strong as we have noticed in the previous session, the trend may continue. Today\u2019s bearish market move is yet to cross the 20-day moving average. And the RSI line is yet to cross the signal line of the RSI indicator. Likewise in the MACD indicator, the MACD line is yet to cross the MACD signal line. There for, a bearish trend cannot be confirmed yet for the Chiliz market. We need to patiently wait to see the direction of the market in the next session. The day\u2019s trading session opens with the failure of the buying pressure to advance the price beyond the November 8 resistance price level. A massive bearish move took place in the second trading session. But since the third session, it looks like the buyers have successfully secured a new support level at around $0.25 price level. The momentum of the selling pressure is waning at this level. Likewise (and more than the bullish performance of Chiliz) a new token still in its presale shows the prospect of much upside price performance. The collapse of FTX brings about a need for a cutting-edge trading intelligence platform, and that exactly is what offers. It is a platform that can adequately detect impending adverse issues similar to what happened to FTX and thus enabling investors and traders to pinpoint safe opportunities for good profits. The D2T token presale is ongoing and it has raised $6.5million so far.",

    "content": "It has been that there has been a continuation in the SOL/USD market bulls\u2019 pushing weight weaknesses as the crypto coin falls near the $10 support line. The last several hours of trading have metamorphosed between $13.27 and $12.57, keeping a pace of minus 2.71 percentage rate as of the time of writing. Resistance levels: $20, $25, $30 Support levels: $10, $7.50, $5 The SOL/USD daily chart reveals the crypto market falls near the $10 support level in a range-bound style as the $20 resistance level is the upper range part. Two horizontal lines have to highlight the value lines where range motions are featured. The 14-day SMA indicator is $21.69, underneath the $30.89 value line of the 50-day SMA indicator. The Stochastic Oscillators have tightly conjoined to maintain a consolidation-moving posture in the oversold region at 13.95 and 14.15 levels, indicating there is a light myth that the former trading instrument will strive for a recovery soon. Prolongation of the market bulls\u2019 weaknesses may potentially degenerate into giving bears more strength in the range-bound spots to push down below the $10 support level as the price falls near it. At this point, a 1-hour chart will let long-position placers detect an early stage of spotting the possibility of price making a rebound before joining the move from a baseline afterward. In terms of investment talk, this time could be the best period to add to portfolio sizes. On the downside of the technical analysis, as it is, it appears not to be the time to join an ongoing declining force in the range-bound spots of $20 and $10 of the SOL/USD market operations. A chain of lower lows has formed toward the lower range line. It does possess an ideal technical window opportunity for getting decent entries. It may as be highly psychologically inclining to exit some of the sell orders that might have executed below the $40 point or around the $30. In comparison, has deepened into lower range-bound spots below the trend lines of the SMAs. The 14-day SMA indicator is underneath the trend line of the 50-day SMA indicator. The Stochastic Oscillators are consolidating their presences in the oversold region at 12.60 and 12.28 levels to indicate that the base crypto may still witness some debase-moving pattern against the counter-trading crypto for a while. A bullish candlestick that can emerge from a lower zone will be a notification sign toward getting upswings to invalidate the continuation of the bearish trend. For now, the collapse of FTX brings about a need for a cutting-edge trading intelligence platform, and that exactly is what Dash 2 Trade offers. It is a platform that can adequately detect impending adverse issues similar to what happened to FTX, thus enabling investors and traders to pinpoint safe opportunities for good profits.

    "content": "The year 2022 has been one of the most turbulent years for the global financial economy, including the crypto industry. With the crypto market already suffering the consequences of a severe bearish trend, things worsened further at the start of this year. As the world was recovering from the realities of the Covid industry, things worsened further with Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. All these factors significantly impacted Bitcoin\u2019s performance in the market. It is surprising considering Bitcoin attained its all-time high value exceeding the $60k mark in just November last year. Unfortunately, the fall of FTX also resulted in adverse consequences for the token bringing its value down to a two-year low in recent times. But will BTC exceed the $17k mark this weekend? Continue reading to find out. If you have been keeping up with the developments in the crypto industry, you must have attended to the news about FTX\u2019s collapse. The entire fiasco went on for a couple of weeks until recently, when FTX\u2019s Sam Fried-Bankman had to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. As you know, FTX was one of the leading crypto exchanges operating in the market at the start of this year. The CEO of the exchange had, in fact, earned himself the reputation for being the savior of the industry. He did so by acquiring many other crypto projects that were suffering due to the bearish performance of the market. The good times for FTX went on for quite some time until a new report from CoinDesk spilled out all the beans in front of the world. The report featured a leaked balance sheet from Alameda Research, FTX\u2019s trading company. The balance sheet brought forward many unanticipated truths that swept the crypto industry. The balance sheet highlighted that most of Alameda\u2019s assets were FTT tokens, the native currency of the FTX exchange. This meant trouble since the CEO was using this asset holding as collateral for funding many risky projects. Following this revelation, Binance came into the picture with an announcement that it shall be liquidating all its FTT holdings. This struck fear among investors and traders, given Binance is by far one of the largest investors in the exchange. Consequently, people went into a mode of panic and started withdrawing funds from the exchange and selling all their FTT holdings. However, FTX decided to close down its withdrawal processing, which only worsened things. But things looked like they would change for good after Binance announced its plans to acquire FTX. Unfortunately, even this deal fell apart as even Binance could not handle the mess FTX had in its books. Quite a few officials from Binance even went on to call FTX\u2019s books a black hole where one cannot make sense of almost anything. Following these developments, the FTX CEO, Sam Bankman Fried, filed for bankruptcy. Of course, Bitcoin is still the dominant player in the crypto market, and it has the potential to set trends in the crypto world. But that does not mean it is independent of all other developments in the industry. Following the collapse of FTX, almost every token in the market felt the heat, including Bitcoin. One of the primary rationales behind this is that people are now very reluctant in many ways and are somewhat wary about investing in cryptos. This evidently resulted in a huge drain of capital in the market, further deteriorating the overall aggravating situation. Hence, the collapse of FTX has had a direct or indirect impact on Bitcoin\u2019s value. The recent developments in the crypto industry have devastatingly impacted Bitcoin\u2019s overall valuation. Things went so bad so quickly that the token fell below the $18k mark after months and plunged into a new two-year low. However, as Bitcoin prices are picking up once again, things seem to change with each passing day. While the token has dabbled between low price ranges of $14k to 15k in the past couple of weeks, this week, Bitcoin reached over $16k after quite a long time. At the time of writing this, Bitcoin is priced at $16,665, and this has left many wondering if the token will break the $17k mark this weekend. There can be many factors fueling this rise, but the most important factor has something to do with the country of El Salvador. The president of the country, Nayib Bukele, recently announced they would be buying Bitcoins on a daily basis starting from the 17th of November. The country currently has 2,381 BTC worth a total investment of $39.4 million, down from $103 million due to recent developments. Following this, President Bukele declared the country would start buying more BTC every day starting from the 17th of November. This news came three months after the last BTC acquisition of the country. The stakeholders welcomed this move as it will put the demand and supply equation into play and change things for good. While Bitcoin started the day with a good announcement, the token\u2019s price has remained the same. The best one can do now is wait for the weekend to be over and see if the token can break the $17k mark. The crypto world is volatile, and stakeholders are well aware of the nature of the market. Thus, it is never always possible to predict the future of a token since anything can change at any given time. But that does not mean you should stop investing in this market and go home. Instead, you must learn lessons from these developments and use these situations to your advantage. The collapse of FTX highlights the significance of more intelligent trading platforms like that will help one find the right opportunities and make the most of them. Besides that, there is with its native token, $TARO, ideal for beating the next price rise with its new $100k milestone. Also, is nearing its $2 million mark, while is nearing the staggering $13 million benchmark. This shows that the crypto industry is not short of opportunities as long as you can find the right one.",

    "content": "American CryptoFed DAO, the first decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) to get legal recognition in the United States, is at risk of losing its registration after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) dug up anomalies in the Form S-1 registration statement dated Sept. 17, 2021. The Wyoming Secretary of State\u2019s office recognized American CryptoFed as a legal entity in July 2021 , at a time when the organization\u2019s CEO, Marian Orr, believed that \u201cWyoming is arguably the top blockchain jurisdiction in the world.\u201d However, on Nov. 18, 2022, the SEC instituted administrative proceedings against the DAO to determine the issuance of a stop order. A stop order from the SEC would retract American CryptoFed\u2019s registration and bar sales of in-house tokens, Ducat and Locke. According to the SEC\u2019s Division Of Enforcement, the Form S-1 registration statement filed by American CryptoFed lacks vital information, such as audited financial statements and details about its business and management. The SEC further believed that the American CryptoFed filing contains \u201cmisleading statements and omissions\u201d while being inconsistent in describing the tokens as securities. In this regard, David Hirsch, Chief of the Enforcement Division\u2019s Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit stated that: Hirsch clarified that issuers must provide the required disclosure information to the SEC. However, the SEC claimed non-cooperation from American CryptoFed during its examination of its registration statement. Based on the information made available to the public, Hirsch shared SEC intent regarding the DAO: Cointelegraph found that the official Telegram channel for the DAO has been disabled. However, the deletion of the Telegram account was not yet linked to the SEC\u2019s investigation at the time of writing. American CryptoFed has not yet responded to Cointelegraph\u2019s request for comment.

    "content": "Less than a couple of weeks back, crypto suffered a market-wide crash where most cryptocurrencies fell massively in price, many showing a decline of over 30%. Bitcoin, for example, slipped by close to $5.5k and is barely making a recovery. Amidst the market downfall, triggered by the FTX balance sheet concerns, there were a few coins that were able to pull themselves up. Although nowhere near their price before the drop, these coins have performed certainly well in the past 24 hours. Unlike the market leader Bitcoin which has shown almost no signs of recovery in the past week. To understand how the top crypto gainers have held firm for the past 24 hours, we must examine the tokens and the sentiment around them that dictated their price. Here are a few top gainers that display some optimism in the market, along with a few cryptocurrencies that turn out to be an ideal choice for investors, given the current market condition. is a decentralized blockchain network that supports a range of applications while being a self-sustaining, secure and efficient blockchain throughout. Launched in 2019, the blockchain operates on Proof of Stake and has a native token by the ticker symbol ALGO. Following the crash that commenced on Nov 8, the token dropped from $0.40 to $0.26 and touched a low of $0.24 on Nov 14. Since the low, the ALGO token has shown an upward trend and is currently trading at $0.30, gaining close to 6% in the last 24 hours. In May, FIFA announced its partnership with Algorand making it an official blockchain platform of FIFA. This news sent a wave of excitement among investors, and as the world cup is about to start on Nov 20, investors are anticipating a positive performance from the coin. While the crypto crash imposed selling pressure on investors, the belief that Algorand\u2019s association with reputable organizations will make it an appealing coin of choice in the long term has prevailed in the market. Owing to this, the coin continues to trace its path upwards, showing a decent increase in price in less than a day. If you\u2019re familiar with the term metaverse, there\u2019s very little chance that you haven\u2019t heard about Sandbox is among the top metaverses in crypto, or in general for that matter, and is fundamentally among the most solid crypto tokens in the market. It is a decentralized NFT metaverse, where users can purchase, create and sell their virtual reality NFTs, or buy a plot of land inside the metaverse. The project has a lot of big names associated with it, with one being the popular hip-hop artist Snoop Dogg. The primary reason the coin has managed to recover from its price drop is that it\u2019s been almost a couple of weeks since the crash took place, and the concerning sentiment across the crypto market is starting to fade off. Sandbox, being one of the best high-utility crypto projects, presents a great opportunity for new investors, more so because the token is now available at a discounted price. In addition to that, the price of the token is less than a dollar, making it highly accessible to all users. Given these characteristics, the project has attracted some attention in the last few days. Internet Computer offers a decentralized alternative to the current internet cloud providers, by allowing independent data centers to interact with each other. The platform allows users to create applications, websites and other web services. ICP has been cited as an \u201cavoidable\u201d crypto project when it comes to adding it to your portfolio, most because the token is down more than 99% since its launch, and has continued to trace a perpetual decline ever since. While the project has displayed a gain in the past 24 hours, mostly triggered by the daily cycle burn of its tokens- recorded to be the maximum this month. This in no way encourages investment in the project, given the long-term view isn\u2019t as bright as it may appear to be. If you\u2019re looking for cryptos that can offer exponential returns in the longer run, we have a few suggestions: It is clear from the FTX crash that there is a need for an advanced trading intelligence platform and is just the solution. The platform can help suggest investors\u2019 safe choice of investments while making sure investors get above-market average returns from their investments. The platform integrates an on-chain analysis tool, and a social sentiment indicator and notifies users of new presales and launches, helping them assess potentially highly rewarding cryptocurrencies. The token for the platform D2C is currently in phase 3 of its presale and has raised over $6.6 million so far. Given such a high investment, the project comes out to be potentially one of the best rewarding crypto projects once it lists on an exchange. Blockchains are constantly criticized for their high energy usage, and the consequent environmental harm they impose. However, there\u2019s a crypto project that aims to counteract the negative impact of crypto on the environment, by partnering with brands and helping them manage their carbon credits. When users shop with the brands associated with , they are rewarded with IMPT tokens which can be used to purchase carbon credits. Users can retire their Carbon credits in exchange for NFTs from popular artists or sell them as they see fit. As an investor, if you\u2019re looking for a high-value crypto project, IMPT should be under your consideration. The presale for the token is currently live, and they\u2019ve raised close to $13 million, more than halfway through their target for the presale. The play-to-earn ecosystem is said to thrive the most once crypto gaming becomes mainstream and Calvaria could potentially be among the top players ruling the industry. is a P2E game, played with NFT battle cards, where each card represents a character with a set of unique traits. With a combination of these cards, users advance in the game. Winners will be paid in RIA tokens, which can either be staked or can be used to make in-game purchases. Along with that, token holders also get the right to vote in the official DAO of the platform. The project is currently in phase 4 of its presale and has raised over 1.86 million USDT (roughly equal to the same in US dollars) so far. Investors willing to venture into the crypto play-to-earn ecosystem should consider IMPT as their choice of investment. Although all the tokens listed above have a low entry point and show a lot of potential, it\u2019s best for investors to conduct their research before investing in a crypto project. With that being said, the coins mentioned above could potentially deliver exponential returns, as long as they follow their roadmap and receive continuous support from the community.",

    "description": "GBTC shares keep getting cheaper versus Bitcoin \u2014 an ideal reason to buy for ARK Invest and Lawrence Lepard.",
    "content": "The largest Bitcoin ( BTC ) institutional investment vehicle is coming under suspicion as it trades at a record discount. The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) is the latest Bitcoin industry entity to feel the heat from the debacle over defunct exchange FTX . With contagion and fears over a deeper market rout everywhere in Bitcoin and altcoins at present, misgivings are impacting even the best-known \u2014 and trusted \u2014 crypto industry names. In recent days, it was the turn of GBTC, the long-embattled Bitcoin investment fund, amid problems at a related crypto firm, Genesis Trading. As Cointelegraph reported , parent company Digital Currency Group (DCG), as well as operator Grayscale itself, swiftly sought to reassure investors and the market that its flagship product was financially watertight. This did not appear enough to satisfy nerves, however, leading to additional public declarations of faith in DCG and GBTC. Among them was Coinbase Institutional, the institutional investment arm of major exchange Coinbase. \u201cNothing is more important than ensuring our clients' assets are safe,\u201d it tweeted on Nov. 17. GBTC\u2019s image has been under strain for some time. Since 2021, it has traded at a discount to the BTC spot price, a discount which is now approaching 50% . Amid a lack of demand, speculation has increased thanks to rumors that Grayscale may end up being bought should Genesis Trading fail. This change of tack could have implications for GBTC, as Grayscale notionally remains intent on converting it to an exchange-traded fund (ETF). \u201cThough this is a difficult moment for many in crypto, I am deeply optimistic about the future of this industry, Grayscale 's business, and the opportunity for investors,\u201d Grayscale CEO, Michael Sonnenshein, tweeted on Nov. 19. Consensus on the $10.5 billion GBTC potentially being forcibly sold remains weak. Related: Grayscale cites security concerns for withholding on-chain proof of reserves \u201cGenesis may go under, but I find the odds of GBTC trust being liquidated to be highly unlikely just given the cash cow that it has been,\u201d Lyle Pratt, creator of messaging platform Vida Global, reacted . The steepening discount following the FTX saga has meanwhile made GBTC a somewhat ironic \u201cbuy\u201d for names such as ARK Invest and Lawrence Lepard, investment manager at Equity Management Associates. \u201cLots of questions and DM's. Lepard view on Grayscale and GBTC Spoiler alert: I own it,\u201d he began a dedicated Twitter thread by saying over the weekend. On the topic of how bad the contagion could be for DCG and its family of firms, Leopard nonetheless acknowledged that it \u201cis impossible to know how much distress they are in.\u201d He continued to analyze the fallout should the worst-case scenario \u2014 bankruptcy \u2014 ensue.

    "description": "TIME spoke with Intuit's Sasan Goodarzi about how the slowing economy is affecting his customers and his top concerns as a CEO.",
    "content": "(To receive weekly emails of conversations with the world\u2019s top CEOs and business decisionmakers, click here .) In Silicon Valley, a land littered with success stories, Sasan Goodarzi\u2019s tale is anything but typical. Born in Tehran, he and his family immigrated to the U.S. to escape the Iranian Revolution. Within six months, his father died, forcing his older brothers to find a way to support the family. Coming to America as a 9-year-old, Goodarzi says he faced not just a new language and unfamiliar culture, but outright hatred and bullying in school, which stifled his love of learning and led to him graduating from high school in Orlando, Florida with a C-minus average. Goodarzi found his footing and ultimately rose to become chief executive of software stalwart, Intuit, in early 2019, after earning a master\u2019s in business administration from the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University and decades of experience in the tech sector. Still, his early struggles inform his management style and worldview. When global protests over Iran\u2019s treatment of women erupted in September, Goodarzi spoke out. \u201cThe amazing people of Iran are showing what they\u2019re made of,\u201d he wrote on Twitter in early September. \u201cHuge respect for the brave women who are risking their lives to let the world know the line has been crossed and are demanding their basic human rights. As a native Iranian, I stand with you and could not be more proud.\u201d A few weeks later, he urged his peers to get involved. \u201cIf you have a platform, make your voice count,\u201d he tweeted. Intuit, approaching its 40th anniversary in 2023, develops and operates a collection of software products and services aimed at helping individuals and small businesses manage their finances. But Goodarzi sums up the company\u2019s broader aims as a mission \u201cto power the prosperity of those that we serve.\u201d The Mountain View, Calif.-based company\u2019s offerings include TurboTax, QuickBooks, Credit Karma, Mint and Mailchimp. Since assuming the role of chief executive, Goodarzi has not only set ambitious goals for Intuit\u2019s growth, but has also made a bold public pledge to the company\u2019s customers. That is, to double the household savings rate for people using Intuit\u2019s services and to improve the success rate of small businesses on its platform by 10% over the national average\u2014both by 2025. The average U.S. household saved about 7.9% of its disposable income in the two years before the pandemic, according to the OECD, and only half of small businesses survive beyond their fifth year. To date, Goodarzi says Intuit has surpassed that small business success rate and is over halfway to the household savings rate goal. TIME spoke with Goodarzi recently about how the slowing economy is affecting his customers. He laid out one of his top concerns as a CEO, and talked about what it takes to get hired at Intuit. This interview has been condensed and edited for clarity. ( For coverage of the future of work, visit TIME.com/charter and sign up for the free Charter newsletter. ) Intuit has a portfolio of products that help individuals and businesses organize their finances. What are you seeing right now from your customers as inflation is putting a squeeze on consumers and small businesses? We have a lot of data. So we see consumer spending on our platform. We see bank account balances, because small businesses connect to bank accounts. We actually see the number of employees and we see worker hours paid and hours worked. And I would just say in this environment, believe it or not, small businesses and consumers are generally healthy. Now, let me tell you about both sides of the coin, so I don\u2019t mislead. The small businesses that we serve\u2014they are growing. Their biggest issue is they can\u2019t hire enough employees, and they\u2019re thriving. Consumers\u2019 unemployment is still very low. And when we look at account balances of consumers, they\u2019re actually better than they\u2019ve been in years. The other side of that is very real. Consumers and small businesses are paying more for rent. They\u2019re paying more for food. They\u2019re paying higher gasoline prices. And if you\u2019re a small business, you\u2019re also paying more for this very employee that you needed to hire now, versus five years ago. So that\u2019s taking a chunk out of the pocketbook. For about two years, many people weren\u2019t commuting to work, or going to stores and restaurants. So they saved money. But do you think something fundamentally changed during the pandemic? Are Americans being a little more cautious with their money\u2014saving more? What we\u2019ve experienced in the last 18 months is people were cooped up in their homes, and when they were un-cooped, people got out. They started spending money. They started traveling. That\u2019s why airlines are reporting great earnings or bullish futures. I think what you\u2019re starting to see now is consumers starting to pull back. They\u2019re starting to buy cheaper brands, although they\u2019re still spending their money. Why? Because they\u2019re having to pay more for gas. They\u2019re having to pay more for rent. They\u2019re having to pay a lot more for food. Sugar is up 70%, for example. So consumers are starting to be careful about spending less in other places. But I don\u2019t think that consumers are being smarter with their money. If they have it, they\u2019re going to spend it. As a CEO, what are your main challenges right now? The biggest one\u2014the thing we worry about most, that we talk about most\u2014is speed. It\u2019s about the velocity of innovation. It\u2019s about moving fast, allowing our engineers to code, versus being in meetings, or being part of a decision. Speed is a leadership decision, and a company at our scale, if you can move fast and deliver for your customers, it actually becomes an advantage. The second thing is always making sure that we\u2019re growing our employees and accessing great talent. We spend a lot of time talking about and architecting the company around speed and access to great talent. What roles are you looking to fill most at the moment? Is it programmers or something else? It\u2019s in engineering, but it\u2019s a couple of specific areas. The core element of our strategy is centered around data and artificial intelligence. Because it\u2019s all about how we leverage the data and how we apply AI to accelerate our innovation. Therefore, the areas where we have added a lot of talent\u2014and we continue to look for talent\u2014is data scientists, data engineers, systems engineers that can think from a systems perspective, and mobile application engineers. If you\u2019re someone who has that kind of expertise and you\u2019re interviewing at Intuit, is there a surefire way of getting the company interested in you? Well, let\u2019s use a data scientist as an example. We have a process that we call A for A, it\u2019s Assessing for Awesome. That includes a one-to-one conversation. But there\u2019s also a panel conversation of two or three people. That data scientist gets a case study, and they have to come in and present to that several-person panel, and explain how they would handle a situation. The things we look for from a data scientist is 1) Do they think about the problem from the lens of what they\u2019re going to do for the customer and the impact they\u2019re going to have for the customer? Because at the end of the day, our boss is the customer. And 2) Do they actually have the ability to apply their data science craft and demonstrate it, not just talk about it\u2014demonstrate their capability around what technologies they\u2019re familiar with, what code they\u2019re familiar with, where they think technology is going, and how they would apply that to the customer problem. And then, of course, the third thing is interaction. How do they interact? Are they going to be able to work on a team? Because a data scientist can\u2019t work alone. If I am hiring a data scientist executive, I\u2019m really looking for the same things. But also asking: Can they lead at scale? Do they know how to hire great people? What track record do they have of transforming an organization? Lots of people in your position are saying it\u2019s really difficult to hire great people with the job market still very competitive. Is Intuit doing anything differently as it relates to hiring? It\u2019s been a challenging environment to hire the best of the best. If we\u2019re competing with another company, once we get a candidate to visit and learn about the problems that they would solve for our customers versus somewhere else, our acceptance rate has been very, very high. They just felt like we had some hairy problems that they wanted to be a part of solving. Also, our attrition rate in the last year was five points lower than any of our peer companies. With all that said, access to talent has been hard, but we\u2019ve been able to achieve our hiring ramp in the last couple of years. Apart from this need to tackle thorny problems, what else do you think is drawing engineers to Intuit? Well, I\u2019ll tell you what I hear from the folks that we hire. I talk to new hires and I also spent a lot of my time doing chats with our frontline engineers at our different sites, particularly those that have been with us for one to three years. I get a firsthand feel for what they love, and also what we need to improve, which is a question I always ask them. The big thing is they like actually working on things that will impact another human being. They\u2019re working on a project that will give you early access to your refund by five days, or instant access to your tax refund. They\u2019re working on things that allow a customer to get paid much faster once they send an invoice. They\u2019re working on benefit programs as part of our payroll platform. They also love it because when their code gets deployed, they can see on the other end the actual impact it had on a human being. And it\u2019s a real impact, because it\u2019s about money. Those are the things that really get the heartbeats of those new hires going much faster, and why they choose to join the company. When you have those conversations with them, what are some of the things they say you need to improve? The consistent themes I hear: They love how customer-centric we are. They love our culture. They love how everybody\u2019s here to help each other collaborate and win. But they wish we would make decisions faster, and they wish they didn\u2019t have to attend as many meetings to get their work done. In all those areas, we\u2019re getting better, but I consistently hear the same thing. Meetings are a real thorny issue. Have you figured out a way of reducing meetings and accelerating actual work? If so, do you have any tips? First of all, we\u2019ve improved a lot in this area. We are nowhere near where we need to be. There\u2019s a couple of things we are doing. One is, we set no meetings in the afternoons for our engineers. One of the big things with engineers is you don\u2019t want to distract them. They can\u2019t code for an hour, jump into a meeting, come back and code for an hour, because they have to spend 20% of the time after they come back to figure out where they left off. So, now they always have four or five hours of uninterrupted coding time. That\u2019s working, and we continue to monitor it. We also realize it\u2019s not being followed everywhere in the company, so we keep working it out. That\u2019s a good one. Any other tips? The other is the concept of two-way doors versus one-way doors. The majority of decisions we make, there are two-way doors. If you make it and you made a mistake or it wasn\u2019t a good decision, you can come back in. A one-way door is you, once you make the decision, you can\u2019t just turn around and say, \u201cOh oops.\u201d If you pay $10 billion for an acquisition, you don\u2019t just turn around and say, \u201cOops.\u201d That\u2019s a one way door. So what we\u2019re working on is being clear, and it\u2019s something we\u2019re working on right now actually, is being clear that 95% plus of decisions are two-way doors, and to enable our teams to move without having to get into meetings. Because a lot of the meetings are two-way doors where you get into a meeting and you\u2019re presenting to management, you don\u2019t even need to do that, just go do it. But culturally, there is a sort of need for a manager wanting to call a meeting on something that they don\u2019t need to. So that\u2019s what we are working on, and we believe it will work. The other is continuing to get better at when you have a meeting, good hygiene. Why are you in the meeting? What decision are you going to make? Who are the three, four people you need in the meeting, versus 50 people in a meeting? And then it should be a decision meeting or an ideation meeting. You shouldn\u2019t get into a meeting just to inform someone and provide an update. That can be done asynchronously. So those are the things that we\u2019re working on. As we all emerge from the pandemic, what\u2019s your opinion about whether work needs to be done in the office or not? When the world shut down in March of 2020, we overnight went virtual with, right now we have over 17,000 employees. We went home overnight. And the good news is we\u2019re a technology company. We have all the tools and we could work virtually. And frankly, many things over time accelerated, because people were actually more productive and effective. So we felt like we needed to really step back and think about what we wanted to do, versus just assuming we all come back to work. What that means to us is that we announce that we\u2019re letting mission based teams decide which days they want to come together in the office and work, and which days they want to work virtually. We did not prescribe, \u201cYou have to be in the office Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday.\u201d We\u2019re letting teams do it, and the reason for that is when we sent everybody home overnight, we didn\u2019t give them instructions. Everybody just worked virtually, and then we figured out how to work in our mission based groups. So we are leveraging that learning as we\u2019re in a hybrid environment.

    "description": "The best way to honor her legacy is by documenting, amplifying, and paying attention to the attacks trans people are facing",
    "content": "Monica Roberts began tracking violence against the trans community in 2006, long before national organizations, governmental agencies, and, perhaps most important, the media, were paying close attention. Her award-winning blog, TransGriot , aggregated local news, police reports, and community-sourced information. Her no-frills style of reporting and her reputation as a trusted journalist and blogger in the community made her a critical resource. Tapping into a rich network of trans people on social media and tips received via email, Roberts was a go-to for trans activists across the country, particularly during a time when the media wasn\u2019t regularly reporting on the killings of trans people or doing so in a way that honored the lives of those lost. \u201cMonica was making sure that not only was she cataloging these murders, whenever there was an article that was written when the person was misgendered, she was able to write the article correctly,\u201d said trans activist Dee Dee Waters, who was also a longtime friend of Monica. \u201cIt was really good to have her, as we tried to conquer a lot of this transphobic stuff.\u201d In West African culture, a griot is a tribal storyteller who acts as an advisor to leaders and serves as a living archive. For more than a decade, Monica offered that crucial service to a community that is often overlooked and mistreated. When I worked at the New York City Anti-Violence Project (AVP) , part of my job was to track violence against LGBTQ people, and Monica\u2019s blog was invaluable. She regularly broke stories that went beyond the violence that trans communities disproportionately face. As a growing movement and understanding for trans communities progressed in the aughts, so did her coverage, with posts about trans people in politics, music, and TV and film . As individual states act with increasing hostility to trans people\u2014 The Washington Post reported that, as of Oct. 13, more than 155 pieces of anti-trans legislation had been introduced this year alone\u2014violence against the trans community is only going to get worse. These laws attack bodily autonomy and self-identification, as well as deny crucial medical care and have introduced harmful discussion about sexual orientation and gender identity. Which means we need people in the world\u2014from the mainstream media to elected officials to allies of trans and nonbinary people\u2014to sit up, pay attention, and spread the word of the ongoing violence trans people face. In the fall of 2020, Monica died at 56 years old . Her unexpected death, due to blood clots in her lungs, reverberated throughout the LGBTQ community. The Association of LGBTQ Journalists (NLGJA) lauded her groundbreaking journalism, and the National Association of Black Journalists (NABJ) posthumously inducted her to its hall of fame . Her blog now lives on as an archive , and more digital content will be produced by Transgriot LLC under the leadership of Waters, with plans to continue additional reporting on the issues facing Black trans Americans. The legacy she left is one of watching out for and taking care of her community, especially in moments when it seemed as if few outside of the community were listening or taking action. In one of Monica\u2019s last posts on anti-trans violence , she documented the murder of Selena Reyes Hernandez, who was shot and killed by 18-year-old Orlando Perez after she disclosed that she was transgender to him. \u201cShe is the sixth Latinx transperson to die in 2020 and the 14th transperson this year, but I\u2019m just now finding out about this May 31 murder because of misgendering of her by the Chicago medical examiner, Chicago PD and the Chicago media,\u201d wrote Roberts on her blog. \u201cEven her family went there in disrespecting her in death, choosing to bury her in her native Mexico under her deadname.\u201d Monica Roberts at the GLAAD Gala in San Francisco on Sept. 8, 2016. Kimberly White\u2014GLAAD/Getty Images In 2019, the American Medical Association (AMA) and the Human Rights Campaign (HRC) called the killings of trans Americans an epidemic following at least 28 homicides in 2018 and 25 homicides in 2019. \u201cAccording to available tracking, fatal anti-transgender violence in the U.S. is on the rise and most victims were black transgender women,\u201d said AMA board member S. Bobby Mukkamala, M.D., in a 2019 press release . \u201cThe number of victims could be even higher due to underreporting and better data collection by law enforcement is needed to create strategies that will prevent anti-transgender violence.\u201d Since then, homicides of trans people have doubled to historic levels of violence with limited media attention or public outcry. In 2020, there were at least 44 homicides of trans and nonbinary people, and 57 in 2021, and 33 so far through this year, according to Sue Kerr, a blogger and social worker who is one of the few individuals tracking violence against trans folks. \u201cWhen Kathryn Newhouse was killed in Georgia, nineteen, murdered by her father. And she\u2019s AAPI, she\u2019s autistic, and she has mental health issues. All these intersections, no one wrote about it,\u201d Kerr said about a murder that happened March . \u201cThe one thing I\u2019ve noticed that\u2019s a big difference from when I was writing these in \u201814, \u201815, \u201816, is that people on the ground, usually the friends of the deceased, are all over the media.\u201d This was the case for 28-year-old Brazil Johnson, who was shot and killed in Milwaukee, Wis., in June. Johnson\u2019s family and friend\u2019s described her to a local outlet as \u201ckind-hearted .\u201d The family and friends of 50 year-old Nedra Sequence Morris , who was killed in May, organized a vigil on her behalf to demand justice. The friends and community of trans people, commonly known as chosen family, now serve as unofficial media spokespersons, and become advocates for their friends, or loved ones after death. There are a handful of individuals and organizations across the country tracking the violence against trans people. The Anti-Violence Project ( AVP ) continues to lead a national coalition of organizations doing data collection on anti-LGBTQ violence. TransLashMedia , led by trans media personality Imara Jones, marks each trans individual\u2019s death on their Instagram channel. HRC also tracks anti-trans violence and releases an annual report . Every year the constant has been an emphasis from advocates to say \u201cat least\u201d alongside any number about the murder of trans people\u2014knowing that with the limited available tracking, there are names of trans people whose stories go untold. It\u2019s important to remember that violence against marginalized communities does not begin with murder. It starts with the acceptance, both passive and deliberate, of increasingly hateful rhetoric, which fuels legislation and emboldens people to commit acts of violence. Trans people, disproportionately Black trans women, are facing violence on the streets and from intimate partners, family, or co-workers, and from legislation that aims to dehumanize and ultimately eliminate trans people from the public space. There\u2019s a growing animus against trans people that manifests as violence in real life, and we must call it out for what it is. Every year, on Nov. 20, the LGBTQ community remembers the lives of those lost for the Transgender Day of Remembrance. This year\u2014and every year after\u2014Monica will be remembered as a ferocious leader who cared enough to look out for the needs of her community. She was not only taken too soon, and her absence from our movement will be felt immensely, her care and love for her community always remembered. The way to honor her legacy is for all of us to take up part of the work of documenting, amplifying, and paying attention to the attacks trans people are facing. We cannot stand by idly. We must demand justice. More Must-Reads From TIME Steven Spielberg Waited 60 Years to Tell This Story Who Should Be TIME's 2022 Person of the Year?

    "content": "While investors are eager to learn when they will be able to recover their funds from the now-defunct crypto exchange FTX, insolvency lawyers warn that it could take \u201cdecades.\u201d On November 11, the crypto exchange and 130 affiliates filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the United States. Insolvency lawyer Stephen Earel, partner at Co Cordis in Australia, stated that \u201crealizing\u201d the crypto assets and determining how to distribute the funds will be a \u201cenormous exercise\u201d in the liquidation process, which could take years, if not \u201cdecades.\u201d He attributes this to the complexities associated with cross-border insolvency issues and competing jurisdictions. Earel stated that FTX users are in the same line as everyone else, including creditors, investors, and venture capital funders, and that those who have made \u201ccrypto to crypto trades\u201d may not receive a distribution \u201cfor years.\u201d Simon Dixon, founder of global investment platform BnkToTheFuture and an active participant in the Celsius bankruptcy proceedings, stated that anyone who holds funds on FTX will become creditors, and a creditors committee will be formed to represent their interests. He stated that creditors will eventually be able to access the remaining assets, depending on what remains after bankruptcy costs. According to Binance Australia CEO, these costs could be high due to the time required to recover funds, which means more legal and administrative fees that eat into customers\u2019 returns. Meanwhile, Irina Heaver, Partner at Keystone Law in the UAE, said that users in the Middle East are also feeling the effects of the FTX collapse, as the region was the third largest FTX user base. Heaver explained that because FTX already has a license and regulatory supervision from Dubai\u2019s newly formed Virtual Assets Authority regulator (VARA), the regulators face major complications because they already have a \u201chuge regulatory failure\u201d on their hands. Heaver stated that creditors\u2019 rights will be overseen by the legal system, with courts and bankruptcy administrators involved \u201cwhen and if\u201d FTX enters Chapter 11 bankruptcy procedures. Heaver\u2019s advises people who have suffered significant losses as a result of the FTX collapse to seek legal counsel and join forces with \u201cother injured parties.\u201d The recent FTX collapse has had far-reaching consequences for investors worldwide. According to recent reports, the bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange may have \u201cmore than 1 million creditors.\u201d According to a Reuters article published on November 20, the bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange owes \u201cnearly $3.1 billion\u201d to its top 50 creditors.",

Buyers have been pressing against the barrier at $0.0001800 since November 10. The crypto\u2019s price has attempted to break through the resistance four times but has failed. As it crosses over the moving average lines today On the upside, the altcoin will go toward the next resistance at $0.0002200 if it breaks above the resistance level. But as long as buyers are unable to push the price over the resistance level of $0.0001800, the coin will continue to trade sideways between levels of $0.0001400 and $0.0001800. LBLOCK fell to a low of $0.0001444 on November 19 as it targets the $0.0002200 high. As it reaches the peak of $0.0001674, the bullish momentum has burst over the lines of the moving averages. The region of overbought has been reached by the current rise. The altcoin has a daily Stochastic level of 96. The overbought area is anticipated to offer resistance to LBLOCK. Furthermore, LBLOCK has recovered bullish momentum since its dip on November 9 as it approaches the resistance around $0.0001800. However, Dash 2 Trade, a different coin, has seen its value soar recently. This puts into more perspective the requirement for a cutting-edge trading intelligence platform, and that exactly is what . It is a platform that can adequately detect impending adverse issues similar to what happened to FTX, thus enabling investors and traders to pinpoint safe opportunities for good profits. The D2T token presale is ongoing and it has raised $6.5 million so far. You can purchase Lucky Block here. \u2022 \u2022",

While JHU is responsible for creating the site, additional contributions were made by NASA, the European Space Agency, the National Science Foundation, and the Sloan Foundation. The main page encourages you to scroll down as the viewer watches the number of celestial objects increase and then brings them to a 90-degree view of the night sky that has all 13.7 billion years of the cosmos right there in front of them. While this opening page serves as the summary of the interaction, the \u201cexplore the map\u201d and \u201cdescription\u201d links at the bottom of the page allow the viewer to examine the map in more detail. \u201cExplore the map\u201d lets the viewer scroll back in time in 100-million-year increments all the way to the edge of the observable universe, also known as the Cosmic Microwave Background, while they are provided detailed descriptions of various celestial objects during their journey, which include several types of galaxies and quasars. \u201cDescription\u201d does an excellent job answering questions in detail that the viewer might be asking throughout their journey pertaining to both the map and the instruments that were used to gather the data. These include easy-to-understand figures and diagrams. At the bottom, the viewer is also given the option to either download or purchase the map for their own personal or educational purposes. Overall, this interactive map is small, easy-to-use, and concise in its ability to share the entirety of the cosmos with easy-to-understand descriptions that are likely suitable for astronomy lovers as young as grade school.

    "content": "Customers of the decentralized exchange (DEX) section would reportedly pay gas charges for swaps that are at least 10% less than those of 1inch\u2019s prior offers, making switching activity on the Ethereum network more lucrative for its users. In the Router v5, 1inch predicted that swaps would be 10% more gas efficient compared to the second-best participant in the DEX segment and about 5% more gas efficient than in the previous edition. A new interaction logic, pre-/post-interactions, and an upgraded smart contract error processing system are among the new features and advancements brought to the Router v5 from earlier routers. The latest edition has undergone audits from almost a dozen industry initiatives, including Consensys, OpenZeppelin, and ABDK Consulting, and is also intended to prioritize security. Co-founder of 1inch Network Sergej Kunz said \u201cWe have gathered enough improvements since the 1inch Router v4 was published to warrant the introduction of the new fifth version. [\u2026] In comparison to utilizing any other DeFi device, our users will now save at least 8\u201314% more because to our improved gas cost optimization.\u201d The 1inch Network would implement the 1inch Aggregation Protocol and the 1inch Limit Order Protocol on Avalanche and Gnosis Chain, formerly known as the xDai Chain at the start of the year. In order to give its user base with access to the 1inch Limit Order Protocol v2, as well as deeper liquidity and improved token swaps via the 1inch network, 1inch connected with Klaytn, South Korea\u2019s most well-known metaverse blockchain, in August. The Router v5 is the newest router by DEX aggregator 1inch. The business said that by lowering gas prices for swaps, Router v5 will make consumers\u2019 experiences with decentralized finance (DeFi) more convenient.",

With the beginning of the proceedings of the FTX bankruptcy lawsuit, the exchange said that they owed more than $3 billion to their top 50 creditors. Moreover, it mentioned that it owes nearly $1.45 billion to the top 10 creditors, without naming them. The exchange during the court proceedings said that it was reviewing the assets they have and are preparing for the sale or reorganization of some business. However, as per an expert, the top creditors or the equity holders may be given the first preference for restructuring, while the investors in the Bahamas-based companies may be the next ones to receive.\u00a0 Meanwhile, the FTX account holders could be their least priority as they stand at the end of the queue.\u00a0 yikes.. reason why rich gets richer and retail gets fucked pic.twitter.com/7HvOqYJVzw\u2014 frxresearch (@frxresearch) November 21, 2022 On the other hand, FTX\u2019s sister concern, Alameda Research, a trading platform, has transferred nearly $37 million USDC to an address named FalconX. This is speculated to be user\u2019s funds which were squeezed without intimating them. Meanwhile, the so-called \u2018hacker\u2019 who stole assets worth more than $600 million swapped them into ETH & stablecoins. In a recent update, these ETH were further traded into wBTC & renBTC through aggregators like 1Inch. Therefore, it is pretty clear that the retail traders who traded on FTX exchanges on a daily basis and kept the platform active are the least considered for any restructuring. Moreover, the user\u2019s funds which were stolen, have been utilised. Hence, a re-broadcast of MT. Gox\u2019s rehabilitation plan is expected to repeat, and retail investors may wait for a long time to retrieve their lost funds.",

He is also interested in purchasing some parts of the troubled FTX cryptocurrency exchange. Garlinghouse thinks that if transparency and trust are kept as a priority, the cryptocurrency sector will grow stronger. He places a high value on bitcoin because it gives individuals the opportunity to reject the private monopoly and control over people\u2019s assets for the first time in history \u201cPart of my conversation [with SBF] as if he needs liquidity, maybe there are businesses that he has bought or he has that we would want to own. Maybe there are investments that we would want own. Would we have bought some of those from him? I think that was on the table.\u201d On Nov. 16 and 17, 2022, during the 6th annual RippleSwell conference in London, Mr. Garlinghouse revealed that former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried had called him two days prior to the company declaring bankruptcy in an effort to gather investors to save it. He also took to Twitter and explained in a long thread \u201cWith all that\u2019s happening in the past few weeks (and over the course of this year\u2019s ups and downs), it feels even more imperative that we\u2019ve gathered together in person to have honest conversations about solving real-world problems with crypto and blockchain. As I said on stage \u2013 I firmly believe that crypto will be stronger because of this if we keep focusing on transparency and trust. Ripple has and will continue to lead in this regard.\u201d What\u2019s Next For Ripple Vs SEC? Regarding the SEC\u2019s (Securities and Exchange Commission) lawsuit against Ripple, founder Chris Larsen, and co-founder Garlinghouse, Brad Garlinghouse and Stuart Alderoty both anticipate a decision in the first half of 2023. Final legal briefs must be submitted by Nov. 30 in order for the court to make a decision or schedule a jury trial.",

This is revealed as the bulls seem to have been on a winning streak, after price action tested the floor of the Bollinger indicator. Additionally, price activity seems to have found support at the MA line. Consequently, this implies that we are more likely to witness additional upside moves in Lucky Block price.

Here on the 1-hour chart, we can see that price candles bounced off the Bollinger band but soon resumed their upward path. Subsequently, this resulted in to price rising higher and has placed price further above the MA line. Likewise, the RSI lines are now in the overbought region with the two lines seem positioned to continue in that region. Technically, market signs are aligned to portray possible additional upward move in the price above the $0.0001700. More like what we have here on the LBLOCK market, there is another crypto called the Impact Token. Its presale is still ongoing and has raised approximately $13 million within weeks of its presale. This is because the token is eco-friendly and is attractive to investors, as a result, this supplies bullish sentiment to the token.

He referred to the possibility of a meltdown as \u201cgame over for the games,\u201d meaning that it would be impossible to continue playing. game over for the games, certainly.\u2014 jack (@jack) November 16, 2022 Moreover, Markus is certain that this situation would definitely provoke a \u201cbigger than projected Monday market meltdown.\u201d Cryptocurrency investors have historically responded to disruptions like the recent FTX debacle by selling off their holdings in the market in a frenzy. As a result of all this doubt, some people have even declared Bitcoin \u201cdead.\u201d Does Bitcoin Stand A Chance? According to the analyst\u2019s assessment, the leading cryptocurrency is still active and growing in popularity around the world despite having \u201cdied\u201d more than 460 times. As a result of its restricted supply, it has become legal tender in countries with struggling economies such as El Salvador and the Central African Republic, and many investors see it as a way to protect themselves from inflation. Binance Is Secure, Claims Zhao\u00a0 Many market participants anticipated that the FTX issue would trigger a domino effect and pull other exchanges into the muck, however, the reality was different and the impact wasn\u2019t as bad.\u00a0 The largest cryptocurrency exchange, Binance, on the other hand, confirmed that its financial sheet was stable and even increased the amount of its Secure Asset Fund for Users (SAFU) to $1 billion to protect users in a catastrophe. In addition, the corporation established a recovery fund for the industry, which is intended to assist projects that are having difficulty during difficult economic times. To disprove the allegations, CEO Zhao publicly said that Binance is establishing an industry recovery fund to assist projects that are otherwise robust but are experiencing a liquidity problem. This will serve to lessen the negative effects of FTX that will continue to cascade. We\u2019ll have more information soon.\u00a0 Meanwhile, he issued a challenge to anyone seeking additional information to get in touch with Binance Labs.",

    "content": "According to analyst Benjamin Cowen, BTC could be flashing a bottom signal. Amid rumors threatening to drop BTC to $13k, market participants are still long-term bullish. While several foreboding rumors making the rounds in the crypto market have seen the price of Bitcoin (BTC) dump to less than $16,000, analysts are still confident that the pioneer digital currency could have reached a cyclical bottom. According to popular crypto market analyst Benjamin Cowen, the BTC percentage of supply in profit and loss metric is flashing signs of a historical bottom for the asset. He told his over 774,000 YouTube subscribers that the metric is one of his favorites as it shows the ebb and flow of the market during bear and bull markets. In previous years including 2011, 2014, 2015, 2018, and 2019 when this metric crossed over the 30-day moving average, it accurately marked the bottom of the BTC market. One of my favorite on-chain indicators is the Bitcoin percentage of supply in profit and loss. The reason I like this one is because of how cyclical it looks \u2013 the ebb and flow of this indicator\u2026 If you apply the [30-day] moving average to [the Bitcoin percentage of supply in profit and loss]\u2026 what you\u2019ll notice is that historically, they have always crossed before the bottom was in, His analysis is coming at a time when the price of BTC has hit $15,800 for the first time since 2020. According to an analysis by Santiment, the drop was thanks to fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) due to a lack of trust in exchanges, especially since the FTX exchange collapsed. Exacerbating the situation is the roster of firms that have been run aground or are likely to suffer losses. One of these that have been rumored to be in trouble is Digital Currency Group (DCG), the parent company of Genesis and Grayscale. Read More: BREAKING: DCG didn\u2019t find investors, will Bitcoin and the whole crypto market implode? Report Another FUD-creating event that is shaking the market is the movement of crypto assets in the wallet of the hacker of the FTX exchange. Blockchain security firm Chainalysis said in a tweet that the FTX hacker has been bridging ETH to BTC. The notice added that the asset is likely to be mixed as the hacker may attempt to cash out through exchanges. \ud83d\udea81/ Funds stolen from FTX are on the move and exchanges should be on high alert to freeze them if the hacker attempts to cash out \u2014 Chainalysis (@chainalysis) November 20, 2022 Market analyst still sees a price explosion for BTC in early 2023 Amid the various speculations that BTC could drop to as low as $13,000, analysts are still long-term bullish for the benchmark crypto. Billionaire venture capitalist Tim Draper said in a recent interview that he still expects BTC to reach $250,000 by early 2023, sticking to his prediction from last year. Draper said that he expects the price target to be reached once the market recovers from the massive FUD and people, especially women, start using Bitcoin for daily shopping. He noted that women\u2019s interest in crypto is already showing signs of increasing, having recently grown from controlling 7.14 percent of Bitcoin wallets to 16.6 percent.

    "content": "The post Ben Armstrong Says \u2018Crypto is Not Dead\u2019, Supports With Evidence appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The FTX crisis and the lowest levels of Bitcoin trading have led to the widespread belief that the crypto industry is dead. Top YouTuber Ben Armstrong, better known as Bitboy, said that cryptocurrency is not dead and will not be, regardless of what happens next. In 2022, Bitcoin has dramatically decreased in value from its all-time high of $69,000 reached in November 2021, having lost 76% of its value in a single year. Crypto is not dead. NO MATTER what happens with GBTC/Genesis/Silvergate.., remember this:When $BTC was barely relevant Mtgox was hacked. 90% of Bitcoin transactions happened there. Almost the entire market at one place\u2026 gone\u2026 poof.And we survived and thrived.\u2014 Ben Armstrong (@Bitboy_Crypto) November 19, 2022 He uses the failure of Mt. Gox, one of the biggest Bitcoin exchanges at the time, as evidence, claiming that the market rebounded well. The Mt. Gox exchange crashed in February 2014 as a result of a major 840,000 BTC hack. A record-breaking high of about $1,100 had been reached by Bitcoin only a few months prior, and Mt. Gox accounted for the majority of transactions\u2014about 90%\u2014at that time. Ben Armstrong predicted the FTX crash? Ben came close to predicting what would occur days in advance, though, so it is important to note that. \u201cIf you don\u2019t close your FTX account today and get your funds off that exchange ASAP, I\u2019m sorry, but you are the definition of low IQ and deserve what\u2019s going to happen to you.\u201d And two weeks later, after everything unraveled, FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried told his clients he was, quote, \u201creally sorry we ended up here,\u201d he had said on Twitter. If you don\u2019t close your @FTX_Official account today and get your funds off that exchange ASAP\u2026 I\u2019m sorry but you are the definition of Low IQ and you deserve what\u2019s going to happen to you.\u2014 Ben Armstrong (@Bitboy_Crypto) October 29, 2022 Armstrong specifically said that Sam Bankman-Fried is urging lawmakers to pass legislation that would rigorously control the cryptocurrency industry. He also pledged to reveal many additional wrongdoings committed by SBF. Additionally, Bitboy asserted that FTX was taking advantage of its users in late October when the exchange\u2019s API was abused. The blogger had already made disparaging remarks about both the exchange and its leader, Bankman-Fried, before the entire incident.",

Grayscale GBTC Trust, the largest legal holder of BTC, refuses to provide any Proof of Reserve. To begin a community lead effort at transparency for the GBTC holdings, we have taken steps to ID likely GBTC addresses and balances based on public info and blockchain forensics. pic.twitter.com/WFtOyoCEay \u2014 \ud83c\udff4\u2234Ergo\u2234\ud83c\udff4 (@ErgoBTC) November 20, 2022 Per the analysis, Ergo reveals that they have identified 432 addresses holding about 317,705 BTC, likely part of the GBTC reserves. It is worth noting that the team started its analysis around July 2019, when Grayscale moved custody of its assets to Coinbase from Xapo. Grayscale declined to release a proof-of-reserves in response to community demands citing security concerns inspiring the effort from Ergo. In the wake of the FTX collapse, the crypto community speculates that Digital Currency Group, the parent company of Genesis Trading, Grayscale, and CoinDesk, is the next domino to fall. It comes after Genesis Trading, arguably crypto\u2019s biggest lender announced its decision to halt operations despite receiving a capital infusion from DCG to cater for the loss of $175 million in assets in the FTX collapse. However, a Wall Street Journal report cites illiquid assets in its balance sheet as the reason for halting withdrawals. The report also indicates it sought $1 billion in capital to resume operations. Genesis is seen as the go-to for institutions and whales looking to lend crypto to earn yield. Consequently, several industry pundits have asserted that a Genesis collapse could have a bigger ripple effect than FTX. Already, Gemini has been forced to halt its earn program. In light of recent information, users speculate DCG itself may be insolvent. According to North Rock Digital founder Hal Press, the size of funds required indicates that the liability lies with DCG . Consequently, users have also called to question the health of the Grayscale trust. Notably, Coinbase released a letter today to assure users of the safety of Grayscale assets in its cold storage wallets. \u201cCoinbase Custody Trust Company, LLC (Coinbase Custody) writes to you to reaffirm that the assets underlying all of Grayscale\u2019s digital asset products held at Coinbase Custody, as listed in the table below, are secure,\u201d Furthermore, it asserts that each user\u2019s assets are kept separately to avoid mixing user assets. \u201cCoinbase Custody always ensures that each client\u2019s digital assets are segregated on-chain, in deep cold-storage, from both the property of Coinbase Custody and the assets of other Coinbase Custody clients,\u201d Coinbase writes. \u201cThis means that the digital assets underlying each Grayscale product will never be commingled with or confused for the digital assets of any other client. This also means that the digital assets of each Grayscale product can be confirmed on-chain.\u201d Despite these assurances, the community continues to frown at the refusal of the exchange to reveal the wallet addresses. Messari founder Ryan Selkis in a tweet today, asserted that this week is likely to be a turbulent one for DCG and its subsidiaries. GBTC continues to trade at a 43% discount to the actual Bitcoin price indicating investor bearishness.

The series follows a group of immigrants heading to New York when they encounter a ship that went missing four months earlier. Throw in some mysterious incidents, a creepy kid, and some unsettling backstories, and you have 1899.

During their journey, the ship comes across another vessel that disappeared four months earlier, <a href=\"https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/1899-how-ships-names-kerberos-prometheus-might-play-role-understanding-netflix-mystery.html/\">called the Prometheus</a>. Both ships belong to the same company, but most believed the Prometheus was lost at sea.

However, knowing Odar and Friese are behind it means not everything is as it seems.</p> <p><em>1899</em> uses a lot of symbolism throughout all eight episodes. The upside-down triangle is shown the most, and viewers catch glimpses of the symbol in everything from clothing to jewelry. Each episode focuses on the backstory of a different passenger. That passenger, in particular, starts off the episode by hearing a voice say, \u201cWake up.\u201d When they open their eyes, audiences see their pupils are shaped like an upside-down triangle.</p> <figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\"> <div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"1899 | Official Trailer | Netflix\" width=\"925\" height=\"520\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/p7OUQ9U2qIw?start=46&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div> </div></figure> <p><strong>RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/netflixs-1899-i-watched-all-8-episodes-still-no-idea-whats-going-on.html/\">Netflix\u2019s \u20181899\u2019: I Watched All 8 Episodes and Still Have No Idea What\u2019s Going On</a></strong></p> <h2 id=\"h-comic-book-artist-mary-cagnin-calls-1899-identical-to-her-story-black-silence\">Comic book artist Mary Cagnin calls \u20181899\u2019 \u2018identical\u2019 to her story \u2018Black Silence\u2019</h2> <p>Over the Nov. 19, 2022, weekend, Cagnin posted on Twitter claiming that Netflix, along with Friese and Odar, used a plot that\u2019s startingly similar to her original idea.

Subtle plot details, such as the characters\u2019 personal dramas, including their mysterious deaths.\u201d</p> <p>Cagnin believes Netflix and showrunners got the idea when she appeared at an \u201cinfluential and international fair in Europe\u201d called the Gothenburg Book Fair in 2017.</p> <p>She also adds, \u201cI\u2019ve been on panels and distributed the <em>Black Silence</em> comic to countless publishers and people in the business. It\u2019s not hard to imagine my work reaching out to them. I not only delivered the physical comic but also made the translated version available in English.\u201d</p> <p>Cagnin concludes the thread by stating that even though <em>Black Silence</em> is a short story, \u201cthe essence of what she created\u201d is found in the Netflix series <em>1899.</em></p> <figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\"> <div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"1899 | Official Teaser | Netflix\" width=\"925\" height=\"520\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ulOOON_KYHs?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div> </div></figure> <h2>Several people disagree with Cagnin\u2019s claims</h2> <p>Not everyone jumped on board with Cagnin\u2019s claims that Netflix\u2019s <em>1899</em> is a blatant rip-off of her story <em>Black Silence.</em> Many think that the connection between the two is flimsy at best.</p> <p>One Twitter user <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ern_ygr/status/1594562923904761856?s=20&t=bFF6Ga6-5hLY7sZF2Ynqdw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">wrote</a>, \u201cThe reason for this blowing up is that the prospect of \u2018catching\u2019 a Netflix show for plagiarism is a much more exciting narrative to spread as opposed to simply looking into the matter and accepting that her accusations borderline delusional so far it seems.\u201d</p> <p>Another <a href=\"https://twitter.com/IDEASOFICE_FIRE/status/1594544465070342144?s=20&t=bFF6Ga6-5hLY7sZF2Ynqdw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Twitter</a> user added, \u201cI have to say, after reading the English translation of this comic it\u2019s not similar enough to 1899 for this to count as plagiarism in my opinion.\u201d</p> <p>Netflix hasn\u2019t commented on the matter as of this time.</p> <p><strong>RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/1899-netflixs-biggest-mystery-year.html/\">\u20181899\u2019 Looks Like Netflix\u2019s Biggest Mystery of the Year so Far</a></strong></p>",

Ortega\u2019s highly-anticipated Netflix series, <em>Wednesday</em>, is set to premiere in just a couple of days. Meanwhile, Ziegler recently wrapped her very first lead role in the upcoming film, <em><a href=\"https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/maddie-ziegler-blew-director-new-movie-bloody-hell-away.html/\">Bloody Hell</a></em>. But despite their actors\u2019 demanding schedules, they seem to make time for each other and maintain their friendship. In fact, Ziegler recently showed her support for Ortega at the Los Angeles premiere of <em><a href=\"https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/wednesday-jenna-ortega-biggest-concern-addams-family-series.html/\">Wednesday</a></em>.</p> <figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"823\" src=\"https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Jenna-Ortega.jpg\" alt=\"Jenna Ortega wears black to the 'Wednesday' premiere which Maddie Ziegler also attended\" class=\"wp-image-3271286\" srcset=\"https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Jenna-Ortega.jpg 1200w, https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Jenna-Ortega.jpg?w=640&h=439 640w, https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Jenna-Ortega.jpg?w=768&h=527 768w, https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Jenna-Ortega.jpg?w=1024&h=702 1024w, https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Jenna-Ortega.jpg?w=87&h=60 87w, https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Jenna-Ortega.jpg?w=150&h=103 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" /><figcaption>Jenna Ortega | Michael Tullberg/FilmMagic</figcaption></figure> <h2 id=\"h-how-did-jenna-ortega-and-maddie-ziegler-meet\">How did Jenna Ortega and Maddie Ziegler meet?</h2> <p>Ortega and Ziegler became fast friends after they were cast in <em>The Fallout</em>. Prior to filming,<a href=\"https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/dance-moms-kenzie-maddie-ziegler-tried-quit-years.html/\"> the <em>Dance Moms </em>alum</a> paid the <em>You</em> actor a visit. Though they\u2019d met in passing at a photoshoot years before, they wanted to get to know each other a bit more. Since their characters in the film (Vada and Mia) end up striking up a friendship, they wanted to form a genuine connection. Fortunately, the pair ended up hitting it off immediately, and they spent 13 straight hours just sitting and talking.</p> <h2>\u2018The Fallout\u2019 actors are very similar in some ways </h2> <p>And it seems that the actors have sustained their friendship even after they wrapped <em>The Fallout</em>.

    "description": "New AI aims to democratize 3D content creation, no modeling skills required.",
    "content": "Enlarge / A poison dart frog rendered as a 3D model by Magic3D. (credit: Nvidia) On Friday, researchers from Nvidia announced Magic3D, an AI model that can generate 3D models from text descriptions. After entering a prompt such as, \"A blue poison-dart frog sitting on a water lily,\" Magic3D generates a 3D mesh model, complete with colored texture, in about 40 minutes. With modifications, the resulting model can be used in video games or CGI art scenes. In its academic paper, Nvidia frames Magic3D as a response to DreamFusion, a text-to-3D model that Google researchers announced in September. Similar to how DreamFusion uses a text-to-image model to generate a 2D image that then gets optimized into volumetric NeRF (Neural radiance field) data, Magic3D uses a two-stage process that takes a coarse model generated in low-resolution and optimizes it to higher-resolution. According to the paper's authors, the resulting Magic3D method can generate 3D objects two times faster than DreamFusion. Magic3D can also perform prompt-based editing of 3D meshes. Given a low-resolution 3D model and a base prompt, it is possible to alter the text to change the resulting model. Also, Magic3D's authors demonstrate preserving the same subject throughout several generations (a concept often called coherence) and applying the style of a 2D image (such as a cubist painting) to a 3D model.Read 3 remaining paragraphs | Comments",

He mainly removed those who were not following him. Cuban claimed he was still interested in cryptocurrency. However, after he claimed last month that cryptocurrency had grown rather monotonous, many saw it as an indication that he would be moving away from it. As FTX plummeted within only 2 days this month, tremendous activity ended a four-month sideways trend in cryptocurrency and made it once again exciting. After those incidents, many cryptocurrency investors pledged to keep investing, including Cuban. However, some people now interpret the unfollowing of Cuban as an attempt to separate himself from the cryptocurrency community. Mark Cuban unfollowed MetaMask, DeFi Pulse, The Block, Uniswap, Nansen, and Solana. The post Is Mark Cuban Taking Time Off Crypto? appeared first on Crypto Academy.",

    "content": "The post Bitcoin is Breaking Down While the Hash Rate Marks new ATH, Are the Bottoms In? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The bitcoin price is heading to form new bottoms, as after rebounding a couple of times, it dropped below $16,000 and formed new yearly lows at $15,476. The capitulation period, which is speculated to have begun with the fresh sell-offs, is expected to drag the BTC price lower as the MVRV ratio has plunged below 0.6. The ratio has plunged to these levels only a couple of times in the past decade, in Jan 2015 and December 2018. Meanwhile, the capitulation appears extremely high but the possibility of a bullish reversal from the bottom appears high.\u00a0 With the recent drop in the prices, the traders are experiencing huge losses and they may be compelled to liquidate their assets at a loss. As per the on-chain data provider, Santiment, the network has recorded the lowest amount of BTC transactions in Profit since 2019. The $BTC drop below $15.8k has caused many traders to finally exit the sector or liquidate assets. #Bitcoin is seeing the lowest level of transactions made while in profit since Nov, 2019. Bounces typically occur when this metric is severely negative. https://t.co/siuHaH2bd8 pic.twitter.com/60HaSo0eqb\u2014 Santiment (@santimentfeed) November 21, 2022 The BTC ratio of daily on-chain transaction volume in profit to loss has slashed to -0.390 from the levels within the positive range. Meanwhile, the ETH ratio also has dropped to -0.30, indicating that traders facing extreme losses at the moment.\u00a0 The BTC long-term holders were at loss for a pretty long-time. However, the rise in the BTC hash rate, which marked new highs, has made it more difficult for the miners to sustain. The Bitcoin hash rate, which determines the total computing power required to mine and process the transactions on the blockchain, has marked new highs. With a rise in the BTC hash rate to 316 TH/s, the miners may now face actual pressure as they appeared to be hoaxed at the present prices. Hence, many may be compelled to sell their holdings to compensate for the mining activities.\u00a0 Collectively, Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) price appears to be in extreme danger as all the technical & on-chain indicators point toward a bearish close for the month. Meanwhile, some volatility may be expected as the trade approaches the end of the yearly trade, but if the bulls remain aloof, the price may eventually mark a bearish close for the year 2022.\u00a0",

    "description": "The daughter of Kim Jong Un who was recently seen in public for the first time at a missile launch site is his second child, South Korea\u2019s spy agency says.",
    "content": "SEOUL, South Korea \u2014 The daughter of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un who was recently seen in public for the first time at a missile launch site is his second child, South Korea\u2019s spy agency told lawmakers Tuesday, as speculation swirled about his motives for bringing her to the attention of the outside world. On Saturday, North Korea said that Kim observed the launch of the country\u2019s most powerful intercontinental ballistic missile \u2014 Hwasong-17 \u2014 the previous day with his wife Ri Sol Ju and their \u201cbeloved daughter.\u201d State media released photos showing Kim walking hand-in-hand with a young girl clad in a white coat and red shoes past a massive missile placed on a launch truck, and watching a soaring weapon from a distance. [time-brightcove not-tgx=\u201dtrue\u201d] In a closed-door briefing at a parliament committee, South Korea\u2019s National Intelligence Service, the country\u2019s main spy agency, told lawmakers that it assesses the daughter is Kim\u2019s second child named Ju Ae, Yoo Sang-bum, one of the lawmakers who attended the meeting, said. Youn Kun-young, who also attended the NIS briefing, confirmed the substance of Yoo\u2019s comments but refused to provide further details. The daughter apparently is Kim\u2019s child who retired NBA star Dennis Rodman saw during his trip to Pyongyang in 2013. After that Pyongyang visit, Rodman told the British newspaper Guardian that he and Kim had a \u201crelaxing time by the sea\u201d with the leader\u2019s family and that he held Kim\u2019s baby daughter, named Ju Ae. It was the first time North Korea officially confirmed her existence. North Korea\u2019s state media didn\u2019t disclose the age, name and other details of Kim\u2019s daughter last week. South Korean media have speculated Kim married Ri in 2009 and that they have three children, who were born in 2010, 2013 and 2017, respectively. Kim, 38, is a third generation of his family to run North Korea since 1948. He inherited power in late 2011 upon the death of his father Kim Jong Il. Kim and his father were both first mentioned in state media dispatches after they became adults. Given that, the revealing of the daughter believed to be in her early teens came as a surprise to outside observers. Some experts say the daughter\u2019s disclosing at a missile test site showed that Kim was emboldened by his advancing nuclear arsenal, the backbone of his family\u2019s rule. Others speculate if Kim continues to bring her to major public events, that could suggest that Kim might have her as his early heir apparent in his mind.",

    "content": "The post Your Identity Reimagined With NFTID appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News As it stands now, when you have to prove your identity, you need to provide several different forms of documentation. It could be a driver\u2019s license, a passport, a social security card, a utility bill, a bank statement, or any number of sources. Sometimes, you even need more than one or two of them! It can get pretty confusing, and it\u2019s a bit scary to think that your information is floating around out there on pieces of paper in other people\u2019s possession. Thankfully, Rebus is using NFT technology and Web3 to reimagine how we view our identity \u2013 and give control back to the person to whom it belongs. NFTs give us the ability to assign unique values and ownership to many different types of objects and assets. That means it\u2019s also possible to create NFTs for your identity! This NFTID (nifdy) decentralized identification system can be used worldwide by individuals or organizations. Rebus has created Rebus Nation to test this idea and measure its potential. While NFTID won\u2019t replace your legal documents, but it gives people the opportunity to identify themselves in a totally unique way. For instance, you can deviate from the format of your legal documents by inputting your name in all lowercase letters. You can even put in a set of completely fictitious data. Then you choose which pieces of information are available to others. Even minors can set up NFTID if they\u2019re savvy enough to navigate the DeFi protocol. So how does it work? Well, there are two main components of the NFTID system. The ID storage system is where your information is contained. It\u2019s implemented as a custom application on the Rebus blockchain and handles all information relative to your NFTID. It stores the NFTID type, organization, wallet address, ID, EncryptioKey, and MetaDataURL. The custom user interface is what allows the user to access their NFTID. Once the NFTID is created, the user interface will generate a preview image that will be publicly available and a private, encrypted image available only to the holder. There\u2019s only one rule. Users must respect the identities of others and treat them with respect. Even though NFTID is currently only in v1, Rebus is developing v1 in accordance with features and functionality to be added later. Entire communities will be able to base their membership on NFTIDs, organizations can create their own NFTID sets, and individuals can create comprehensive NFTIDs for themselves. The total utility of NFTIDs has not yet been realized, but once the idea becomes even more widespread, the potential is endless. Building a strong community around non-fungible assets is the primary goal, with an ever expanding future of utility. Disclaimer: This is a press release post.

    "content": "Oeiras, Portugal, 22nd November, 2022, Chainwire Masterblox, a Lisbon-based crypto marketing company, has pledged to bring greater gender parity to the world of web3. Masterblox CEO Isabella H\u00e4ndel is on a mission to highlight the shortage of women working in the industry in a bid to foster greater inclusivity. It is estimated that 85% of all crypto users and workers are male; Isabella is one of the rare women who\u2019ve made it all the way to the top. The industry is slowly becoming more gender inclusive, however, with female-centric projects like NFT collection World of Women gaining traction. Not only that, but female talent is being rewarded with leadership positions at an increasing rate. This trend is especially true among the younger demographics, as millennial women are becoming aware of the potential of blockchain technology and the diverse range of employment opportunities it offers. Isabella H\u00e4ndel is determined to lead by example in the hope that her success with Masterblox will inspire other women to follow suit. Her leadership skills have been fundamental to the success of Masterblox, where she is responsible for ensuring the quality of the company\u2019s services and maintaining its extensive network of contacts and clients. Isabella has risen to the top of her profession at just 25 years of age. Before joining the blockchain industry, she studied traditional marketing and worked for several large corporations such as Siemens and Volkswagen. At the outset of the pandemic, Isabella began delving deeper into web3 and studying any relevant material she could get her hands on. She was pleasantly surprised by the lack of gender discrimination, finding the web3 community to be incredibly welcoming of women in general. In 12 months, Isabella rose to become the CEO at Masterblox. She is now responsible for leading and managing a team of over 30 professionals from different backgrounds, which includes marketers, copywriters, designers, and growth hacking experts. To help women leave an even deeper imprint within the web3 industry, German-Brazilian Isabella has plans to hire more female talent for Masterblox throughout 2023. She believes there is plenty of space for women within web3 and that the industry has everything to gain by becoming more gender-neutral. Isabella has extended a call to talented women with experience in crypto and marketing to reach out to Masterblox and take the next step in their career journey. About Masterblox Masterblox is a Lisbon-based web3 accelerator. Its work is divided between the foundation, which handles all the connections between VCs, partners and projects, and the labs, where its growth hacking methods and support services are provided to the projects within the acceleration program. Masterblox\u2019s labs are responsible for assisting countless DeFi and blockchain projects with marketing, market making, copywriting, social media management, and much more.

    "content": "Genesis Trading, a pioneer in the cryptocurrency industry, has issued a warning that it may be in bankruptcy after its lending arm ceased operations last week and spent the weekend trying to raise money without success. In 2013, Genesis opened the first over-the-counter Bitcoin trading desk. Since then, it has grown to be a major participant in the market. However, following FTX\u2019s disastrous collapse, the business was dealing with \u201cabnormal withdrawal demands\u201d and was looking for a $1 billion loan last week. Following the collapse of FTX, an increasing number of cryptocurrency firms are in danger of going under. Despite the allegations, Genesis claims it has no such intentions. \u201cWe have no plans to file bankruptcy imminently. Our goal is to resolve the current situation consensually without the need for any bankruptcy filing. Genesis continues to have constructive conversations with creditors.\u201d On November 16, 2022, the company tweeted that \u201cabnormal withdrawal demands\u201d had surpassed its available liquidity, claiming the collapse of FTX as the reason for the problem. The default of 3AC negatively impacted the liquidity and duration profiles of our lending entity Genesis Global Capital. Since then, we have been de-risking the book and shoring up our liquidity profile and the quality of our collateral.\u2014 Genesis (@GenesisTrading) November 16, 2022 \u201cIn consultation with our professional financial advisors and counsel, we have taken the difficult decision to temporarily suspend redemptions and new loan originations in the lending business,\u201d the company stated. At the time, a Genesis spokeswoman stated that the company \u201chad been evaluating all viable possibilities\u201d despite the liquidity crisis brought on by the FTX announcement.\u00a0 \u201cAfter reviewing a number of options, we made the difficult decision to temporarily suspend redemptions and new loan originations in the lending business so that we can identify the best solution and outcome possible for clients,\u201d she said.\u00a0 On November 10, FTX declared bankruptcy, causing a wave of crashes and alerts throughout the cryptocurrency industry. When Genesis stopped all withdrawals, the market lending rate for the Genesis Dollar (GUS) increased by 75%, which was linked to a selloff and potential movements to short the asset. Genesis\u2019 final public comment was published on Twitter on November 16 when withdrawals were halted, and the following silence raised worries about a \u201ccrypto contagion\u201d spreading on.\u00a0 The post Genesis Trading Warns of Possible Bankruptcy appeared first on Crypto Academy.",

    "content": "Pitching a startup to investors without a personal recommendation isn\u2019t a terrible idea \u2014 as long as you\u2019ve done your research first. Tetra Insights co-founders Michael Bamberger and Panos Rigopoulos raised a $5 million Series A last year, and the duo said cold outreach was a key part of their strategy. \u201cWhen I changed my criteria to finding people who were a fit, the process was really quick,\u201d says Bamberger, who initially raised a $500K friends and family round in 2019 followed by a $1.5 million seed round a year later. Full TechCrunch+ articles are only available to members Use discount code TCPLUSROUNDUP to save 20% off a one- or two-year subscription Rigopoulos and Bamberger shared their cold-calling advice with TC+, along with the full text of one of their winning emails and a detailed breakdown of the three-step process they used. \u201cOnce you get investors, the story doesn\u2019t matter; it\u2019s all about the metrics, the numbers and the performance,\u201d Bamberger said. \u201cBefore the investment, the numbers are just part of the story, so you really have to understand how you\u2019re telling the story.\u201d Due to the Thanksgiving holiday in the U.S., we are skipping this Friday\u2019s newsletter, but we\u2019ll be back in a week with another TC+ roundup. Thanks very much for reading, and have a great week. Walter Thompson Editorial Manager, TechCrunch+ @yourprotagonist Cold outreach with a warm touch: Here\u2019s the fast pitch we emailed to investors Track and capture: Getting started with attention metrics Image Credits: DBenitostock (opens in a new window) / Getty Images Once upon a time, metrics like time on site and pages per visit were sufficient for growth marketing, but that\u2019s no longer true. To track engagement and performance, brands need to know exactly where their ads appear and whether consumers are viewing them actively or passively. \u201cViewability is no longer enough, and \u2018attention metrics\u2019 are becoming increasingly popular in the industry,\u201d according to Sylvain Le Borgne, MediaMath\u2019s head of data and analytics. \u201cAs attention metrics and measurement continue to mature, brands can learn more, develop a plan aligned with key business outcomes, start optimizing for attention, and kick-off their targeting and measurement tactics to capture consumer attention.\u201d Track and capture: Getting started with attention metrics Get your product and customer success teams on the same page to improve net retention Image Credits: Richard Drury (opens in a new window) / Getty Images You don\u2019t need to move the needle far to optimize customer success. SaaS startups that incrementally improve will stack small wins that have the potential to alter the company\u2019s trajectory. Instead of using a traditional siloed approach, founders should consider rolling their product and CX teams into a single unit to promote cohesion, writes Bryan House, SVP of product and customer success at Elastic Path. \u201cRegardless of what you call the role, product management, UX and customer success should report to the same person,\u201d he advises. \u201cThis leader should create a structure that shares incentives and common goals aligned to your customers\u2019 measures of success.\u201d Get your product and customer success teams on the same page to improve net retention A love letter to micro funds, the backbone and future of venture capital Image Credits: Getty Images Venture capital funds can reach into the billions, but smaller pools that max out at $50 million or less \u201care truly the funds that power the future of the industry,\u201d reports Rebecca Szkutak. Last year, Pitchbook recorded $147.2 billion in general venture fundraising inside the United States, with micro funds raising nearly $17 billion of that amount. \u201c[They are] often the first investment in a company, which creates more opportunity in the lifecycle,\u201d said PitchBook senior venture analyst Kyle Stanford. \u201cEspecially when we talk about how much capital has gone into the venture market, it wouldn\u2019t have been possible without the high number of micro funds.\u201d A love letter to micro funds, the backbone and future of venture capital During a recession, look to drive growth through customer retention Image Credits: MirageC (opens in a new window) / Getty Images Finding ways to reduce customer churn is the heart of any growth-through-retention strategy, but centralizing first-party data is step one, according to Vijay Sundaram, chief strategy officer at Zoho. Weaving together different signals like social media, website behavior and CRM data will help identify high-value customers and drive engagement, but \u201cfirst-party data is likely stored across multiple departments and systems, including marketing, customer advocacy, sales and support,\u201d he writes. \u201cBuilding rich customer profiles and establishing a culture of information sharing need to be core functions of customer-facing teams.\u201d During a recession, look to drive growth through customer retention TechCrunch+ roundup: Attention metrics, growth through retention, cold-calling advice by Walter Thompson originally published on TechCrunch",

    "content": "The three co-founders of alternative financing startup Pipe are stepping down from their roles as executives of the company in one of the most dramatic management shake-ups seen in the fintech startup world in some time. Miami-based Pipe said today it is on the hunt for a \u201cveteran\u201d CEO as Harry Hurst, who has been the face of the company since its 2019 inception, transitions from his role as co-CEO to vice chairman. Fellow founder and co-CEO Josh Mangel will temporarily assume the role of chief executive while Hurst leads the search and subsequent transition in leadership with the help of a global executive recruitment firm. Once a new CEO has been named, Mangel will become executive chairman of Pipe, focusing on product and strategy. CTO and co-founder Zain Allarakhia will remain on the board and serve as a senior advisor to the company. Usman Masood, currently the EVP of engineering, will take over as chief technology officer. \u201cWe are looking for someone who has significant operational experience scaling businesses, from product market fit to market leadership all the way through to rapid growth on a global scale,\u201d Hurst said. The news \u2014 shared with TechCrunch exclusively \u2014 is a bit startling considering that at its height just 18 months ago, Pipe was among the buzziest of fintechs with Hurst serving as its very public frontman. In May of 2021, the company had raised $250 million at a $2 billion valuation in a round that Hurst had described as \u201cmassively oversubscribed.\u201d Certainly, it\u2019s not the first time the founder of a company has stepped down to allow for fresh leadership. But it is highly unusual for all three co-founders to do so at once. And at this stage in a business. In an email interview, Hurst told TechCrunch that the trio has \u201calways known that the next phase of Pipe\u2019s growth would include a veteran operational leader.\u201d He said they initially started a search for a COO in the second quarter and during that process, realized that the role they were defining was actually that of a CEO who could help the company reach its \u201ctrue long-term potential.\u201d He added: \u201cWe\u2019re 0-1 builders, not at-scale operators.\u201d The co-founders remain the three largest shareholders in Pipe, according to Hurst. When asked what percentage of their shares the founders have sold or how many employees took loans from the company to fund the purchase of their own shares, he responded, \u201cAs a private company, we do not share information about anyone\u2019s personal compensation or holdings.\u201d Since its founding, the startup says that 22,000 companies have signed up for Pipe and $7 billion of ARR (annual recurring revenue) has been connected to the platform. Hurst insists that traction is not the issue here, telling TechCrunch that Pipe is on track to \u201c3x\u201d its revenue this year compared to last year. \u2018Nasdaq for revenue\u2019 When Pipe first started three years ago, its goal was to provide SaaS companies a funding alternative outside of equity or venture debt. It promoted itself as the \u201cNasdaq for revenue,\u201d touting that its mission was to give SaaS companies a way to collect their future revenues up front by pairing them with investors on a marketplace that paid a discounted rate for the annual value of those contracts. The goal of the platform was to offer companies with recurring revenue streams access to capital so they didn\u2019t dilute their ownership by accepting external capital or get forced to take out loans. Armed with $50 million in strategic growth financing from the likes of HubSpot, Okta, Slack and Shopify, Pipe announced in March 2021 that it would begin to expand beyond strictly serving SaaS companies to \u201cany company with a recurring revenue stream. That could include, Hurst had said, D2C subscription companies, ISP, streaming services or telecommunications companies. Even VC fund admin and management fees were being piped on its platform, for example, according to Hurst. In February, Pipe announced it was expanding into media and entertainment financing with the acquisition of London-based Purely Capital. With that buy \u2014 its first \u2014 Pipe created a new media and entertainment division called Pipe Entertainment with the aim of giving independent distributors the opportunity to trade their revenue streams in the same way a SaaS company could. Expanding into so many new verticals felt like a bit of a gamble to some observers. Working with SaaS companies with their boring, predictable recurring revenues felt very different than working with independent movie production companies that, as Hurst himself pointed out, sometimes had to wait \u201cthree to five years to get their money back and go on to their next projects.\u201d Hurst appeared to have so much confidence in Pipe\u2019s \u201ccapital markets engine\u201d that he believed it could support \u201cthe entire revenue-as-an-asset class\u201d globally. At the time, he told TechCrunch, \u201cEventually, anyone should be able to originate onto our platform.\u201d He remains optimistic. Currently, over 50% of the trading volume \u2014 the buying and selling of future revenues \u2014 on the platform comes from non-SaaS vertical markets. And surprisingly, Pipe Entertainment is one of the fastest growing verticals on its platform, according to Hurst. \u201cIn general, diversifying across verticals has been positive, and we plan to continue driving additional vertical expansion,\u201d he told TechCrunch. Clearly, much has changed since February as the markets took a dramatic shift. Since then valuations have been challenged, over 100,000 tech workers have been laid off and inflation has surged. Presently, Pipe has 108 employees. It has not conducted any layoffs, Hurst said. The company\u2019s latest move has nothing to do with the company\u2019s current financial situation, according to Hurst, who says that Pipe \u201cis well positioned.\u201d He added: \u201cUnlike many companies in this challenging environment, we have the resources and half a decade of runway to make long-term, strategic decisions from a position of strength to ensure we are continuing to drive further value to our customers and investors.\u201d Pipe has raised over $300 million in its lifetime from investors such as Greenspring Associates, Craft Ventures, Morgan Stanley\u2019s Counterpoint Global, CreditEase FinTech Investment Fund, Fin VC, 3L, and Japan\u2019s SBI Investment. Existing backers such as Next47, Marc Benioff, Alexis Ohanian\u2019s Seven Seven Six, MaC Ventures and Republic. Increasingly competitive landscape While revenue-based financing has been around for decades, it has become more of a pervasive way to fuel SaaS startups in recent years. Y Combinator alum Arc came out of stealth in January with $150 million in debt financing and $11 million in seed funding to build what it describes as \u201ca community of premium software companies\u201d that gives SaaS startups a way \u201cto convert future revenue into upfront capital,\u201d among other things. In August, Arc \u2014 which now describes itself as a digital bank for SaaS companies \u2014 landed another $20 million in a Series A round led by Left Lane. Spanish-American outfit Capchase \u2014 which says it turns \u201cSaaS recurring revenue into flexible growth financing\u201d \u2014 in July of 2021 secured $280 million in new debt and equity funding and has since raised $80 million in equity and taken on another $400 million in debt. Austin-based Founderpath in August announced it had secured $145 million in its own debt and equity financing to help B2B SaaS founders grow their businesses without diluting ownership. Specifically, the company claims that it allows founders to take up to 50% of their annual recurring revenue (ARR) in upfront cash. Crowdz, which secured $10 million in capital co-led by Citi and Dutch growth equity firm Global Cleantech Capital, said this year it expanded from providing invoice-based financing to SaaS-focused SMEs to also providing them with recurring revenue access to upfront capital they need without having to dilute their equity. Unlike Pipe, these companies remain focused on serving SaaS businesses. \u201cAfter our public launch in 2020, we saw a lot of follow-on players enter the space, and we understand some of them may be facing challenges,\u201d Hurst said. \u201cWhile the market has changed significantly since we started Pipe, we\u2019ve never been in a stronger position for this next phase of growth.\u201d More funding flows into Pipe, as buzzy fintech raises $250M at a $2B valuation Pipe\u2019s founding team stepping down as hunt for \u2018veteran\u2019 CEO begins by Mary Ann Azevedo originally published on TechCrunch",

Despite that, the Shiba Inu army has reached yet another milestone as the number of SHIB holders has expanded significantly. Whales keep dumping SHIB Last week, the amount of Shiba Inu owned by those wallets varied between $86 - $82 million. Now, they have continued dumping the second biggest meme coin as its price keeps declining. At the time of this writing, the top 100 whales on Ethereum hold 8,036,305,217,856 SHIB evaluated at $68,301,754.

Related Elon Musk Comments on What Truly Made FTX Fail SHIB trading volume soars by 7.5 million percent Earlier today, CoinMarketCap spread the word about the trading volume of Shiba Inu skyrocketing by 7,449,053 percent. The possible reason for this was the movement of large amounts of SHIB by whales. U.Today reported that yesterday slightly more than one trillion SHIB was moved in just several chunks. However, the meme coin remains in the lows and its price is going deeper down. At press-time, SHIB is changing hands at $0.000008633.

    "content": "ST. PAUL, Minn. -- Voters elected the most diverse slate of candidates to the state legislature ever this year, making the Capitol more reflective of the Minnesota communities lawmakers serve. \u00a0In January when session begins, there will be 35 of the 201 members in both the House and Senate who identify as people of color, according to a list from the\u00a0Minnesota Legislative Reference Library. That's a notable increase from just nine Black, Indigenous of people of color - BIPOC members - who\u00a0served in St. Paul a decade ago.The\u00a0first openly transgender lawmaker\u00a0will join the Minnesota House and the Senate will have the first Black women in its chamber in Minnesota's 164 years as a state.\"I really do believe when you have a variety of thoughts and ideas at the table that we all do better,\" said Sen. Bobby Joe Champion, DFL-Minneapolis. \"Paul Wellstone said it best, he said, 'we all do better when we all do better.'\"Champion was elected by the new Senate DFL majority to be president of the chamber next year, a key role that presides over debates on public policy. He will be the first person of color and to hold that position - just 50 years after the first Black man was elected to the Senate.\u00a0\"When we think about progress, it's important for people to see it,\" he said. \u00a0 CBS Now the legislature better represents the make-up of our state, though it still falls short of mirroring it. Data from the 2020 U.S. Census shows that nearly 24% of the state population is comprised of people of color. BIPOC members at the Capitol in January will account for 17.4% of all lawmakers. The legislature crafts policy and pass state budgets that impact Minnesotans' way of life. \u00a0\"If we want public policy to really reflect and take in consideration all of us then you have to have all of us at the table,\" Champion said.In the House, Republicans tapped another barrier-breaker to steer their caucus next year. Rep. Lisa Demuth, R-Cold Spring, is the first woman to be leader of the House GOP. She is also the first Black person to lead any of the four main legislative caucuses.\"I did not raise my name to be voted in by my caucus to break any history, or make any history,\" Demuth said. \"I actually just wanted to do the job and thought I'd be able to lead our caucus well in the next two years.\"Demuth, who was first elected in 2018, is the head of the House minority, so she'll have to work with Democrats who have control to find compromise to see any policy priorities through. She said there's room for agreement with the DFL and the political environment \"doesn't have to be a constant fight all the time.\"\u00a0\"I'm a conservative. I'm a Republican and I am proud of that. But I'm also here to served Minnesota and the things that matter to all Minnesotans shouldn't be dependent on the color of my skin or my gender at all,\" she said.Her focus is on her leadership style and qualifications, not the historic significance of her new position. She said she asked her colleagues to look past that and not simply \"check a box\" when choosing her to lead.But the impact is not lost on her.\"Why did it take this long?\" she said.",

    "description": "The official start of the holiday shopping season begins with Black Friday on Nov. 25. Here's how to get the best deals without the stress.",
    "content": "H oliday shopping season will officially begin this week with the Black Friday sales on Nov. 25. Typically the busiest shopping day of the year, the sale event has extended to become a multiple-day promotion for many retailers, extending into Cyber Monday\u2014aimed at encouraging e-commerce driven purchases\u2014and sometimes beyond. Navigating these sales for bargains and holiday gifts can be stressful, with several competing deals and offers to sort through. Meanwhile, some shoppers find that they end up with buyers\u2019 remorse when they get swept up in the hunt for deals. Read More: Why We Buy Things We Don\u2019t Need TIME spoke to shopping and personal finance experts about how to ensure that you spend wisely. They shared their advice for getting the best deals without the stress. Be realistic and budget Much of the stress around the holidays comes from the desire to match gift-giving expectations for those you care about. But especially if you have children, it\u2019s important to ensure that you don\u2019t overextend yourself. \u201cIt\u2019s really important for people to dial it back and focus on what it is that you can personally afford this year, and stay within that realm,\u201d says Trae Bodge, Smart Shopping Expert at truetrade.com. \u201cGive yourself grace,\u201d says Tori Dunlap, entrepreneur and person behind the account @herfirst100k on TikTok. Budgeting does not have to be a strict restriction, but rather a guardrail that will make sure you are shopping with purpose. \u201cIt\u2019s the permission slip, you need to spend money without feeling guilty,\u201d Dunlap says. Budgeting during the holiday season can simply be a list of who you need presents for, potential gift ideas and the amount you\u2019d like to spend on the gift. If you can see you don\u2019t have the income to purchase a gift for everyone in the family, be honest with family and friends on how things stand financially, or suggest alternatives like a Secret Santa or White Elephant, says Bodge. In order to gauge how much they should expect to spend this year, Dunlap suggests shoppers look at last year\u2019s budget and how they dealt with it. She says that thinking about whether you brought credit card debt into this year with you and considering how your financial situation has changed can help to shape how much you expect to spend in the upcoming holiday season. Shop smarter Several big retailers, like Target , Walmart and Best Buy , offer their Black Friday deals online ahead of Thanksgiving. If you are worried about not being able to purchase items due to increased online traffic and possible website crashes, you should check out deals before Black Friday. Target, for example, is offering daily and weekly deals, some of which are exclusively available online. Daily deals will occur through Dec. 24 while supplies last, the retailer said in a statement. Shoppers can also take advantage of curbside pickup on select items and locations at stores including Macy\u2019s, Kohl\u2019s and JCPenney. Same or next-day delivery is also available at certain department stores. While in-person shopping is useful for products that need to be seen first-hand, online shopping often offers a greater selection of items in terms of size or color, and makes it much easier to save. Bodge and Dunlap both recommend downloading the Paypal Honey browser extension , which finds coupons and other offers for shoppers. Honey also tracks an item\u2019s historical pricing, making it easier to see if the price of an item actually went down during Black Friday weekend. The Paypal Honey extension is also available for mobile browsers like Safari, as well as through an app. Greg Lisiewski, Vice President of PayPal Shopping told TIME that he recommends using the extension if you\u2019re just browsing online, while the app is more useful if you know exactly what you want to purchase. \u201cYou can actually put in the product name and we\u2019ll do the pricing at different merchants\u2026 instead of having to bounce around from site to site.\u201d If you do choose to order online, Bodge suggests you place your order by Dec. 14, since that\u2019s the last official day that retailers can guarantee that your order will arrive before the holidays. Make store policies work for you Holiday return policy varies from store to store, but most retailers allow shoppers to return items purchased during this time of year through January. Best Buy, for instance, is allowing customers to return any gifts purchased between Oct. 24 and Dec. 31 until Jan. 14, while Amazon is extending returns until Jan. 31 . It\u2019s also worthwhile to consider joining a retailer\u2019s free loyalty program, which grants access to exclusive discounts ahead of time. Stores also offer holiday price match guarantees, which will lower the price of an item if you find an identical item for less at a retail competitor. This can be done at time of purchase, or often after you\u2019ve bought the product\u2014typically you would need to present a proof of purchase for this. Stores like Target also match Target.com prices with in-store purchases. Although sales are already available and last through the holidays, Bodge says that shoppers can find the best deals for small home appliances, like security cameras and robotic vacuums, on Black Friday. Bargains for electronics (laptops, tablets, etc.) are strong from Black Friday through Cyber Monday. Take a beat\u2014and watch out for predatory behavior Retailers can often create a sense of urgency with doorbuster deals, or advertisements that say supply is limited. This can encourage shoppers to panic buy and overspend on things they don\u2019t need, Bodge tells TIME. \u201cSetting a budget for yourself can [also] be really helpful,\u201d Bodge says. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have yourself on your list and set a budget for yourself, you might fall into [a trap] of one [gift] for them, one for me, that causes a lot of people to go over budget.\u201d Dunlap also asks people to think strategically about how they spend their money. Responsible users should use their credit cards as the main way to purchase items to maximize the amount of points, Air Miles and other possible cashback offers for select stores. Shoppers should not, however, depend on credit cards, or online offers like Buy Now Pay Later if they won\u2019t be able to pay back what they have borrowed within a reasonable amount of time to avoid interest accruing. Dunlap also advises against acquiring store credit cards, unless shoppers genuinely purchase or spend a lot of money with those retailers. \u201cPlease be aware that a lot of these stores, when presenting their credit card to you, will call them something like a rewards card. This is not a rewards card,\u201d Dunlap says. \u201cThis is a credit card and store rewards cards tend to have higher interest rates. So if you are a person who was not able to pay off the credit cards on time and in full, a rewards card is going to hurt you.\u201d Do your research and look beyond the big retailers Customers should also look to their existing accounts to ensure they are getting the best deals. \u201cMake sure that you\u2019re aware of the offers that your credit cards might have,\u201d Bodge tells TIME. It\u2019s also worth looking into perks and offers retailers might provide to incentivize customers to choose them over their competitors even if items are priced the same, such as an additional gift card with your purchase, says Bodge. Now is also a good time to think about supporting smaller retailers while still getting a deal, and maybe even finding something more unique than you\u2019d get elsewhere. Small Business Saturday, a marketing initiative aimed at encouraging shoppers to support these sellers, falls on Nov. 26 this year. \u201cYou have more purchasing power during holidays than you do any other time of the year and small businesses, women-owned businesses\u2026[these] people need those dollars most so you can vote with your dollars every day of the year, but especially during the holiday,\u201d Dunlap tells TIME.

    "content": "The post Tron (TRX) And Apecoin (APE) Likely To Be Overtaken By Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The cryptocurrency market suffered another major blow this past week with the apparent collapse of FTX. The latest news is the CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried has stepped down, and the company has filed for bankruptcy. The wider implications will be seen in due course, but this is still a good time to invest in winning new coins. Here we look at why coins affected by the collapse, Tron (TRX) and Apecoin (APE), are likely to get overtaken by Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) as it is forecasted for 6000% growth. >>BUY ORBEON TOKENS HERE<< Tron (TRX) is a Picture of Decline Since Tron price peaked at $0.18 in April 2021, it has been declining beneath a descending resistance line. Tron also fell sharply against an ascending support line that had first appeared in March 2020. Tron is now trading above the horizontal support level of $0.055. The Tron price might drop to $0.036 if it collapses. This represents a 40% reduction from the current Tron (TRX) pricing, with the weekly RSI supporting this decline. On the other hand, a breakout from the long-term line would render this negative forecast for the price of Tron meaningless. Now, it appears improbable that this will happen, and Tron will continue to see a downward trend. ApeCoin (APE) Still Lacks a Proper Use-Case Yuga Labs, the organization that created the Bored Ape Yacht Club, launched ApeCoin (BAYC). ApeCoin garnered a lot of attention due to its connection to the largest NFT project. Many smaller investors viewed it as a way to fund BAYC projects without shelling out hundreds of thousands for an NFT. The owners of the Bored Ape and Mutant Ape collections, however, received the majority of the ApeCoin tokens. What\u2019s worse, Bored Ape holders started selling ApeCoin soon after its launch because it had no apparent use. As a result, BAYC holders profited handsomely from ApeCoin, leaving ApeCoin holders holding the bag. ApeCoin will continue to be in trouble without a distinct use case. This might alter with the full release of Yuga Labs\u2019 metaverse project Otherside. The metaverse\u2019s importance for ApeCoin could help the coin regain momentum. Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) Protects its Members A brand-new decentralized investment platform called Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) has been making waves across the crypto market. It makes it possible to invest as little as $1 in early-stage enterprises and startups. The NFTs-as-a-Service from Orbeon Protocol offers a platform for investments and aids enterprises in overcoming the challenge of fundraising. To do this, startup companies are minted and sold to investors as fractionalized NFTs which can be purchased for as low as $1. Orbeon Protocol gives investors access to the venture capital market and aids in getting early-stage companies the money they require to realize their full potential and succeed. Due to the inherent risk associated with fundraising, the platform contains a \u2018fill-or-kill\u2019 mechanism that automatically refunds investors if any fundraising project fails to reach its targets. The mechanism works on a solid proof audited smart contract. Orbeon Protocol\u2019s native coin, ORBN, has been made available in a presale phase that started at the end of October and will run until January 2023. In this short time, the price of ORBN has increased from $0.004 to $0.009 and is predicted to rise further up to $0.24 by the time the presale ends. Orbeon Protocol is like a beacon of hope in a market beset by bad news.

Using VeCarbon to achieve decarbonization Given that China is among the leading industrialized countries with high tons of carbon emissions from its various activities, it is no surprise that it is looking to adopt blockchain technology to control its climate impact. Opportunities are limitless with the use of and adoption of blockchain technologies. Related: The future: VeChain\u2019s blockchain generates same emissions generated by mining 1 single Bitcoin However, reducing carbon emissions calls for a global effort involving multiple parties, including data sharing, for greater efficiency. With blockchain, entities can build trust and increase efficiency. Furthermore, one of the most crucial parts of blockchain application is centered on carbon emission data management. China\u2019s policy for reaching key carbon reduction targets, peak carbon emissions by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2060, was recently released:https://t.co/DdTMUTN0RI Shanghai Tanlian is ready to achieve a digital low-carbon transformation through #blockchain technology. #VeChain pic.twitter.com/Ba02psqSRq \u2014 eisenreich (@eisenreich) November 22, 2022 This sector is known for its high complexity and requires multi-dimensional international cooperation. Hence, the need for the VeChain blockchain. As a result, VeChain developed VeCarbon, a blockchain-focused carbon emission data platform hosted on the VeChain Thor protocol. The VeCarbon system is specifically designed to tackle complex climate control issues. With carbon data tracking becoming a crucial part of the global climate control mechanism, China intends to leverage VeChain\u2019s innovative platform to trace and ensure transparency in carbon emissions data. As an advanced technology, VeCarbon will provide transformative solutions to reduce carbon emissions by utilizing features of the public blockchain. Hence, Shanghai Tanlian, VeChain\u2019s parent company, has expressed its readiness to ensure that a low digital carbon drive is achieved via the VeChain network. As electricity generation continues to challenge the communist state, policymakers are exploring the mass adoption of solar PV to kickstart its green energy initiative. VeChain reaches a milestone with PoA 2.0 upgrade Meanwhile, the launch of the PoA 2.0 (Proof of Authority 2.0) on the VeChain (VET) protocol signifies another historic win for the network. The PoA will usher in a new phase of sustainable growth and development for the platform with an increased adoption rate. It is worth noting that the upgrade has been a much-anticipated project which the developers completed and unveiled on November 17 at block height 13815000 after the integration of VIP-220. For the Blockchain community, this is the largest network upgrade on the VeChain mainnet since its launch. The update will facilitate several benefits for the ecosystem. Some of the benefits include quality data and improved on-chain security. The upgrade has positioned VeChain as the perfect sustainable platform for energy-friendly projects and real-world solutions. The improved network also has enhanced scalability features to improve tasks in the blockchain space. Meanwhile, the upgrade brings VeChain a step closer to realizing its goal of global adoption of its supply chain management system.

    "content": "Last month, an infamous cryptocurrency trader who got famous for getting off with over $100 million in a contentious price manipulation scheme reportedly lost millions on a similar exploit effort that failed early Tuesday. According to some data, Avraham Eisenberg, the trader responsible for the Mango Market breach in October, just recently borrowed 40 million CRV tokens through the Aave platform. This appeared to be a part of the plan to sell off the tokens, decrease the value of CRV, and profit from millions of short bets on the token, leaving Aave with bad debt as such. However, the scheme did not work out as expected. Early on Tuesday, CRV\u2019s price dropped from $0.53 to $0.41, but it rapidly recovered and soared as high as $0.71.\u00a0 Eisenberg openly described a strategy to influence Aave\u2019s lending regulations weeks before, which would have made it possible for the trader\u2019s Tuesday plot to succeed. I've been advised aave is perfectly safe so here's the potential trading strategy. Not financial or legal advice, but if you do make 9 figures on this feel free to send a tip Note that starting with more initial capital increases success odds and profit percentage pic.twitter.com/HKAF7Y5ogM\u2014 Avraham Eisenberg (@avi_eisen) October 19, 2022 However, neither Aave nor Gauntlet \u2013 the software used by Aave \u2013 moved to take any preventative measures in the weeks that followed to stop an exploit as the one Eisenberg described. Tuesday afternoon, when Eisenberg\u2019s quick plan had failed, Gauntlet released a statement to make it clear that Aave had survived the encounter mostly undamaged. The attempt to squeeze CRV on @AaveAave has been unsuccessful and unprofitable. Despite this Aave has accrued a much smaller insolvent positionOur immediate recommendation is to freeze a number of tail assets on v2 to mitigate the risks of similar, likely unprofitable, squeezes\u2014 Gauntlet (@gauntletnetwork) November 22, 2022 In response to a tweet that has since been removed, Gauntlet said that it would contribute to paying the $1.6 million loss as part of their insolvency refund program, which guarantees to pay up losses sustained by customers like Aave as a result of Gauntlet\u2019s \u201crisk parameter optimization\u201d defect.\u00a0 The plan received a mixed response from some Aave DAO members. \u201cBetter late than never, no?\u201d \u2013 one member wrote. \u201cGauntlet should have done this proposal way before that Avi pulled the trigger. What were you doing all this time while Avi was bragging about his attempt to economically exploit AAVE?\u201d\u00a0 Eisenberg stole over $100 million from Mango Markets, located in Solana, last month using an oracle price manipulation. Mango DAO decided to drop all criminal proceedings against the trader in exchange for Eisenberg returning $67 million of the stolen money to assist the firm pay down its bad debt. Eisenberg accepted the offer; the next day, he revealed himself as the trader responsible for the scheme, describing the widely perceived hack as a \u201cvery lucrative trading approach.\u201d The post Mango Market Hacker Loses Millions In Failed Aave Manipulation appeared first on Crypto Academy.",

    "content": "The post Chiliz (CHZ) And Shiba Inu (SHIB) Holders More Pessimistic As Flasko (FLSK) Goes Up appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Existing cryptocurrency marketplaces are susceptible to erratic price changes as turbulence rises. Well-known cryptocurrencies Chiliz (CHZ) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) are subject to adverse price action in 2023. However, many investors are presently enamored with new cryptocurrency initiatives like Flasko. Chiliz (CHZ) Down 71% From Its ATH\u00a0 Each blockchain-based system must have its cryptocurrency like Socios utilizes the Chiliz (CHZ) token. The objective is to change them from being apathetic observers to proactive promoters. The Chiliz (CHZ) coin combines a blockchain supporter platform with Chiliz (CHZ). No matter this unique application, Chiliz (CHZ) could not see significant increases in the last few weeks. With a current value of $0.2536, Chiliz (CHZ) has lost 71% of its previous peak value of $0.89. As a result, investors in Chiliz (CHZ) have seen some deficits. They are now considering making deposits in other cryptocurrencies like Flasko, which might produce enormous returns soon. Shiba Inu (SHIB) With No Likely Gains Incoming\u00a0 Owners of Shiba Inu (SHIB) are also losing money since the token launched alongside Dogecoin (DOGE). The second-largest joke currency, Shiba Inu (SHIB), has decreased by 7.26% over the past seven days to $0.000009026. Nevertheless, some market players think that the Shiba Inu (SHIB) price decrease is only transitory and predict that the cryptocurrency could rise soon. Although Shiba Inu (SHIB) could see a rise soon, investing in new projects with more potential for growth is much preferable.\u00a0 Flasko (FLSK) With The Most Potential\u00a0 The Flasko presale has only been on for two months, yet it has already entered phase two, and coins have been running out quickly. We can also see why Chiliz (CHZ) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) investors are so interested in it, given the innovation it provides to the equation. With the Flasko initiative, a unique alternative investment platform will be made available where customers may purchase fractionalized NFTs bolstered by genuine premium wine, vintage champagne, and lavish whiskey bottles kept in secure places worldwide. Early investors enjoy the additional benefit of receiving the real-life asset delivered for free to a location of their choice with the purchase of a complete NFT! The Flasko team has also declared that team tokens would be locked for two years and that token liquidity would be suspended for 33 years. This fact and the thorough audit performed by Solid Proof demonstrates that Flasko is among the least dangerous available investment options. From $0.015, Flasko\u2019s value has already grown, and further price increases are imminent. The price of Flasko is currently at $0.085, making this the ideal moment to invest, as it may reach $4 by March 2023!

    "content": "Smart contracts are becoming increasingly prevalent as the world moves towards a more digital and automated future. Still, they are far from being the panacea of all technological ills. Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with a predetermined set of rules. They are stored on the blockchain and run by computers, which makes them tamper-proof and reliable. However, as with any new technology, smart contracts have associated risks. This article will explore some of the most common pitfalls and how to avoid them. What Are Smart Contracts? The web offers many technical definitions for smart contracts, but we will keep it simple for this article\u2019s purpose. A smart contract is a computer protocol that executes the terms of a contract. In other words, it is a way to enforce agreements between two or more parties digitally. Think about the implications of that for a second. A smart contract could help anyone buy or sell anything of value\u2013a house, car, company shares, etc. The possibilities are endless. Before understanding the risks of smart contracts, which are the core of this post, let us look at their benefits. The Benefits of Smart Contracts As mentioned, smart contracts help to enforce agreements between multiple parties digitally. This can happen without the need for an intermediary, such as a lawyer or a notary. This allows for the execution of transactions at a fraction of the cost and time it usually takes. Furthermore, smart contracts are immutable, meaning that, usually, no one can change them once they run. This assures all parties that the contract will perform as agreed upon. Last but not least, smart contracts can help to automate many tasks. This can free up time and resources that you can spend elsewhere. Now that we know what smart contracts are and their benefits let us look at their risks. The Risks Associated with Smart Contracts While the benefits of deploying smart contracts are evident, you must consider several risks. One of the most significant risks associated with smart contracts is the lack of security audits. Given the complexity of smart contracts, they must be thoroughly tested and audited before being deployed on a blockchain. Unfortunately, this is often not the case, and many smart contracts contain vulnerabilities that malicious actors can exploit. Another risk associated with smart contracts is their complexity. Smart contracts are often very complex, making them difficult to understand and debug. This can lead to errors in the contract code, which can have devastating consequences. Finally, smart contracts are often irrevocable, meaning you generally cannot change them once they go live. This can be a problem if a contract contains errors, as there is no way to fix them. Mitigating the Risks of Smart Contracts Mitigating the risks associated with a smart contract is no easy feat. You should consider a few key things when developing or utilizing a smart contract. Below are some tips to help you avoid common pitfalls and secure your contract. Do your research: Look at what your competitors are doing and see what has worked well for them. There is no need to reinvent the wheel when it comes to security. Use a trusted development platform: Ethereum is the most popular smart contract development and utilization platform. However, other options, such as Solana, are also available. Test your code thoroughly: Be sure to test it for all possible scenarios. This includes positive and negative test cases. Keep your code simple: The more complex it is, the more likely it is to contain security vulnerabilities. Use a top smart contract audit company: Some companies offer security auditing services for smart contracts. Among these, we can mention Solidity Finance, SolidProof, PeckShield, Hacken, and OpenZeppelin. This is a critical step in ensuring the security of your contract. Do not put sensitive data on the blockchain: The data stored on the blockchain is public and accessible to anyone. As such, it is essential to avoid storing sensitive data on the blockchain. Educate yourself and stay up-to-date on best practices: The blockchain and smart contracts world constantly evolve. It is vital to keep up-to-date on the latest news and trends. By following these tips, you can help to ensure that your smart contract is secure and avoid common mistakes. However, keep in mind that no system is perfect, and there are always risks associated with any contract. It is essential to understand the risks involved before entering into any agreement. The Advantages and Disadvantages of Different Types of Smart Contracts When it comes to smart contracts, there are a few different types that you can choose from. Each class has advantages and disadvantages you must be aware of before deciding. Here is a look at the most common types of smart contracts: Centralized Smart Contracts The main advantage of centralized smart contracts is that they are much easier to develop and deploy than other types. This is because only one entity needs to be involved in the development and deployment process. Centralized smart contracts also tend to be more efficient than other smart contracts. This is because they don\u2019t have to undergo the same rigorous verification process as decentralized smart contracts. The main disadvantage of centralized smart contracts is that they are much less secure than decentralized smart contracts. Only one entity works to develop and deploy the code, increasing the risk of errors in the contract. Decentralized Smart Contracts Intuitively, the core advantage of a decentralized smart contract is that it enables trustless transactions. In other words, two parties can transact with each other without having to go through a third party or middleman. This is possible because decentralized smart contracts are immutable, as mentioned above. Having a good idea of the pitfalls of dealing with smart contracts. The so-called \u201cDAO Hack\u201d case will help us better understand the matter. The DAO hack occurred on the Ethereum blockchain in 2016. In short, a hacker managed to exploit a flaw in the code of the DAO smart contract. This trick let him siphon off about a third of the funds that the DAO had raised. This incident led to a hard fork of the Ethereum blockchain, which resulted in the Ethereum Classic (ETC) creation. This is a typical example of how things can go wrong when dealing with decentralized smart contracts. Choose the Right Type of Smart Contract Choosing the right type of smart contract is essential to the success of your project. Should you trust the higher security of a decentralized smart contract, or should you prefer to manage a centralized system? As is often the case, the correct answer depends on the scenario. For instance, a decentralized smart contract is more likely to be secure against scrutiny than a centralized one. On the other hand, a centralized system may offer more control and transparency. In any case, you must carefully consider the advantages and disadvantages of each smart contract before making a decision. You see so many centralized exchanges (or CEXs) because they offer easier onboarding and faster transaction. In general, they are more user-friendly for first-time crypto users. However, this comes at the expense of security. CEXs hold users\u2019 private keys in centralized storage (i.e., servers that criminals may hack). This makes them a bigger target for hacking than decentralized exchanges (DEXs), which don\u2019t have a single point of failure. DEXs are often seen as more advanced and therefore intimidating for new users. They can be harder to use and may have longer transaction times. However, they offer increased security because hackers do not have a central server to target. In the end, the best type of smart contract for your needs depends on the specific circumstances of your project. A decentralized smart contract may be the best option if security is paramount. However, a centralized system may be better if you need more control and transparency. In any case, remember that history has brought us many cases of unmanageable centralized systems and hackable decentralized platforms. There is no perfect solution, but with some research, you can find the best option for your project. The importance of Auditing Smart Contracts If you think auditing a smart contract is unnecessary, think again. Just because a contract runs on the blockchain doesn\u2019t mean it is infallible. Smart contracts are susceptible to the same vulnerabilities as traditional software applications. That\u2019s why you must have your contract audited by a qualified security professional before you deploy it. An audit can help you find and fix potential security issues before they cause problems. Here are some of the most common smart contract security pitfalls: Reentrancy vulnerabilities: Hackers can exploit a reentrancy vulnerability if a contract calls an external address that calls back into the first contract. This attack can drain the first contract\u2019s balance and send it to the attacker\u2019s address. Short addresses: With a short address, you might accidentally send your Ether (ETH) to a contract instead of a personal wallet. This mistake can be costly, as you will not recover your ETH if it goes into a contract. Integer overflows and underflows: If a smart contract uses a 32-bit integer, it is susceptible to an integer overflow or underflow attack. This attack can cause the contract to execute unintended code, leading to loss of funds. Unchecked send: If a contract calls the send function without checking the recipient\u2019s address, it could send ETH to a hacker. This type of attack is known as an unchecked send attack. Best practices for Writing Secure Smart Contracts The good news is that some best practices can help you write more secure smart contracts. Following these practices can help mitigate many of the common security issues. Use a Secure Language Choosing a secure programming language is the first step to writing a secure smart contract. Several languages are particularly well-suited for writing smart contracts, including Solidity, Vyper, and Bamboo. These languages let you write smart contracts, and they all include features that help to make contracts more secure. For example, Solidity includes a static type system that can help prevent some types of attacks. Use an Auditor Before deploying a smart contract, it\u2019s essential to have it audited by a professional. An auditor will look for potential security issues and help you fix them before anyone can exploit them. Use Test Networks When testing smart contracts, it\u2019s important to use a test network instead of the main network. Test networks are separate from the main network, allowing you to test contracts without putting real money at risk. Keep Your Contracts Simple The more complex a contract is, the more potential there is for errors. And, of course, errors can lead to security issues. So, if you can keep your contracts simple, you\u2019ll be more likely to avoid security problems. Use Security Tools Several tools can help you secure your smart contracts. For example, the MythX tool can help you find potential security issues in Solidity contracts. Some open-source libraries can help you add security features to your contracts. Following these best practices can help you write more secure smart contracts. However, it\u2019s important to remember that there is no such thing as a completely safe contract. Even the most well-written contract is exploitable if not correctly implemented or deployed. So, always exercise caution when working with smart contracts. Wrapping Up Smart contracts are a powerful tool, but they\u2019re not without risks. Before writing or deploying a smart contract, it\u2019s essential to be aware of the potential security pitfalls. Following some simple best practices can help ensure that your contracts are as secure as possible. Do not underestimate the role of hiring good developers for your contract. In any case, you should always do an audit from a professional to mitigate as many risks as possible. And, of course, always use caution when working with smart contracts.

When asked whether such efforts were safe for the countries involved, the developer said it depends on how these efforts are executed. \u201cThe biggest risk of being friendly is if you end up attracting the terrible people,\u201d said Buterin. \u201cIf you get a certain kind of reputation, it\u2019s very easy to accidentally attract all of the Do Kwons.\u201d Do Kwon was the founder of Terraform Labs, the primary developer behind the Terra blockchain. Terra\u2019s two primary cryptocurrencies \u2013 LUNA and UST \u2013 surged into crypto\u2019s top 20 last year, only to quickly spiral and collapse in May 2022. Kwon is now faces international investigation and the ire of investors worldwide for token holders of billions of dollars. Before the collapse, Do Kwon had amassed a large social media following and often responded rudely to his critics online. Many within the Bitcoin community even sung his praises as he to buy $10 billion in Bitcoin for Terra\u2019s stablecoin reserve. \u201cOne of the things we can do better is not have a community that\u2019s supportive of that kind of behavior,\u201d Buterin said. Though the crypto community has since distanced itself from Kwon, Bitcoiners remain highly supportive of El Salvador President Nayib Bukele.

    "content": "The post Litecoin to Repeat Historical Bull Run, LTC Price Heading Towards this Level appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The top two cryptocurrencies\u2013Bitcoin and Ethereum have almost made up for this week\u2019s losses brought on by the rumblings of the Genesis Global bankruptcy. Talking about altcoins, Litecoin has long held the third spot in terms of market capitalization and for the longest time, it has been profitable for investors. In the midst of the upheaval, an analyst believes that after a long time of bearish sentiment, Litecoin will likely resume its historical bull runs in relation to the price of Bitcoin. On the LTC/BTC ratio chart, Litecoin is currently valued at.0047 ($77.76 worth of BTC), and he predicts that it will break out of its bearish channel and rise to near .02 in early 2023. \u201cAlright, starting to believe this is the real deal for LTC/BTC. It\u2019s long overdue for a solid pump. Here\u2019s how Litecoin works \u2013 long periods of slowly bleeding down sideways, followed by a quick pump up to .02 BTC or so when everything else is bearish,\u201d he said in a tweet. Should Traders Bet on LTC? Analyst Smart Contracter also expects Litecoin\u2019s price to break out. The price breakout, according to the expert, is probably connected to Litecoin\u2019s upcoming halving event, when its programmed code will lower payouts for LTC miners, thus reducing its supply. $ltc of all coins trying to break out of a rather large accumulation of all things i wasnt expecting LTC to be the one to do things pic.twitter.com/wYzM58yT9Q\u2014 Bluntz (@SmartContracter) November 22, 2022 Recently, the crypto community has been more interested in Litecoin as its daily social engagements peaked at 99.91 million. Regardless of LTC\u2019s price direction, according to Lunar Crush, it is time for the community to start paying attention to the coin in the upcoming weeks.

This comes in the wake of a whopping 31 percent increase In just a few hours when the price of Litecoin rose from $61.6 to $81.55 on Tuesday. #Litecoin's price surge may have shocked some of you, but the large address accumulation has been the key to watch.

SBF tweeted on November 24 that he would appear in person to give a speech at the New York Times BookDeal Summit on November 30. NYT writer Andrew Ross Sorkin directs the yearly event. It looks into recent news stories about business and politics; right now, SBF is a hot issue. It would also be the FTX founder\u2019s first appearance in public since his bankruptcy filing earlier this month. I\u2019ll be speaking with @andrewrsorkin at the @dealbook summit next Wednesday (11/30). https://t.co/QocjPtCVvC\u2014 SBF (@SBF_FTX) November 23, 2022 SBF is currently located in the Bahamas, where the NYT expects he will take part in the interview.\u00a0 Reactions On November 24, Sorkin tweeted SBF\u2019s commitment to appear, along with some of his own remarks. He said, \u201cThere are many critical issues to be raised and answered, and nothing is off limits.\u201d Recently, the NYT has drawn a lot of criticism for publishing what the cryptocurrency community refers to as \u201cpuff pieces\u201d for SBF. Last week\u2019s publication was titled \u201cHow Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s Crypto Empire Collapsed.\u201d It did not mention any problems related to the FTX collapse, poor management, or fraud. Even the newly appointed CEO of Twitter, Elon Musk, left a comment on the article, asking, \u201cWhy the puff piece?\u201d\u00a0 Thought SBF speaking at NYT was absurd.But then I saw the rest of the panel. pic.twitter.com/v0pclTzysu\u2014 Trung Phan (@TrungTPhan) November 24, 2022 The crypto community is furious because it seems like the media is again bowing to SBF. Since SBF quit as CEO, he has been active on Twitter, and the new CEO is not amused. According to a report, FTX attorneys said SBF\u2019s \u201cincessant and disruptive tweeting\u201d was hurting their company efforts.\u00a0 The founder of The Daily Gwei, Anthony Sassano, questioned how he could enter the nation without being arrested. If this man is able to walk into New York City (let alone get through U.S border control) and not get arrested then I'll lose all hopeWtf is going on pic.twitter.com/n9RXKlGnGG\u2014 sassal.eth (@sassal0x) November 23, 2022 Vinny Lingham, the co-founder of Civic and Gyft, said SBF was probably not going to jail, adding: \u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong. He absolutely should. But he won\u2019t. He might get convicted, but he won\u2019t serve time. He spent your billions insuring against that.\u201d\u00a0 The post Sam Bankman-Fried To Speak At NYT BookDeal Summit appeared first on Crypto Academy.",

According to a recent Glassnode report, 172,700 bitcoins are leaving cryptocurrency exchanges on a monthly basis, which is the highest rate to date.

Ministries in Russia and the Russian Central Bank have had a negative stance on cryptocurrencies, which led to the banning of crypto payments in the country. Nonetheless, lawmakers in Russia are now working on launching a national crypto exchange. The reports come after members of the Duma parliament discussed regulating digital financial assets that would benefit Russia in the long run.\u00a0 One of the members, Sergey Altuhov, stated that Russia cannot \u201cdeny the existence of cryptocurrencies.\u201d According to him, Russia could earn billions of rubles every year only from the taxes on cryptocurrency trading. Anatoly Aksakov previously stated that a crypto exchange within the Moscow Exchange could be in the works.\u00a0 A couple of months ago, lawmakers introduced a bill that would allow people to mine cryptocurrencies and trade them in foreign markets, given that it was not allowed within Russia.\u00a0 It\u2019s yet unknown whether any of the crypto bills will be approved by the Duma. Nonetheless, lawmakers\u2019 activity suggests that crypto adoption in Russia could happen, despite the previous stance on cryptocurrencies of Russian officials. The war between Russia and Ukraine led many countries to put sanctions on Russia. The latter experienced economic drawbacks as a result, rightfully so. Nevertheless, Russia sees the existence of a national crypto exchange as a method to increase budget revenues. While some see it as negative for the world, many view this recent bill as a good thing for the crypto market. Some even suggest that decisions like this may help the crypto market recover.

    "content": "The Noel Diary Interview: Justin Hartley & Charles Shyer on the HolidaysComingSoon Editor-in-Chief Tyler Treese spoke with actor Justin Hartley and director Charles Shyer about The Noel Diary. The two discussed holiday movies and the original novel the film is based on. The Noel Diary is now available for streaming through Netflix.\u201cWhen a best-selling author returns home at Christmas to settle his mother\u2019s estate, he finds a diary that holds secrets to the past,\u201d reads the film\u2019s synopsis.\ufeffTyler Treese: Justin, there\u2019s such a rich history when it comes to Christmas movies and Netflix does such a great job of putting out some fun ones each year. So what was most exciting about being part of this cinematic tradition with The Noel Diary?Justin Hartley: For me, it was the players involved \u2014 Charles, and then the script as well. I thought the script was really great and I thought the character had a place to go that was difficult to get to and quite a journey from beginning to end. For those reasons, it was an easy decision for me. Those are all the things that you look for, or at least all the things that I look for. It checked all the boxes. So for me, I can\u2019t wait. Let\u2019s do it.Charles, the book was so successful. What really stood out about that original novel that made you want to adapt it, write the screenplay, and then direct it?Charles Shyer: To be honest with you, I didn\u2019t really read the novel from start to finish. There was a script that somebody else had written based on the novel that I read, and I thought, \u201cI know how to make this the kind of movie I want to make.\u201d So I didn\u2019t feel it was necessary to go back. I knew the novel was successful, but it was a very serious approach. I skimmed it, but I didn\u2019t go page by page. So I knew how to make it my own, and I told Netflix what I would do with it, and I had a lot of ideas and they went for it.Tyler Treese: Justin, you know, this story goes throughout the whole emotional gamut. Your character\u2019s dealing with grief, forgiveness, and opening up. You talked about the script really grabbing you. What did you find most interesting about Jake\u2019s journey here?Justin Hartley: I really loved, when I read it, the idea that \u2026 when I take on a job and I get intimidated by the journey that the character goes on, that\u2019s when I get motivated. I get giddy and I get anxious to do the part. When you feel like \u201cthat\u2019s a lot, this is a really well-written character, a really great script, and I hope I can deliver,\u201d that\u2019s when the juices start flowing. It\u2019s almost like an athlete. You almost want that challenge, and this movie absolutely had that. So I love the fact that he goes on this journey \u2014 for several reasons, actually, and it\u2019s difficult. It\u2019s not easy. It\u2019s hard and he might not get what he wants. That, to me, was what sealed the deal.Charles, there\u2019s a really great scene in the film featuring It\u2019s a Wonderful Life. Is that your favorite Christmas movieCharles Shyer: Yeah, I would say it is. That\u2019s the scene that we came up with that wasn\u2019t in the book or in the other script. I wanted to pay homage to that movie, to [ director Frank] Capra. I like the idea that they were the only ones left watching the movie at the end with the dog. I just like the whole concept. It was paying homage to Capra, really. That\u2019s what I wanted to do. And that Barrett (Doss) says it\u2019s the best movie she\u2019s ever seen. I love that.The post The Noel Diary Interview: Justin Hartley & Charles Shyer on the Holidays appeared first on ComingSoon.net.",

Developers at the Ethereum foundation talked on Thursday and decided on eight proposals to explore for Shanghai, the next upgrade after moving to proof-of-stake. The Shanghai hard fork included unlocking staked Ether (ETH) and allowing stakers to withdraw their assets.\u00a0 As reported, a multiclient devnet was released on Wednesday to trial staked validator ETH withdrawals. Developers already agreed to push forward with building staked ETH withdrawals before Thursday\u2019s meeting, tweets from Marius Van Der Wijden hinted on Wednesday. EIP 4844 was among the eight Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIP) agreed on. The EIP centers around better scaling by leveraging proto-danksharding technology. Ideally, this tech will boost network throughput and slash transaction fees. Proto-danksharding sections a blockchain into \u201cshards\u201d to achieve this.\u00a0 Five EIPs focus on upgrading Ethereum Virtual Machine, the staging area where smart contract codes are deployed. The EVM proposals include EIP 3540, EIP 3670, EIP 4200, EIP 4570, and EIP 5450.\u00a0 When Shanghai on Ethereum? Indeed, developers reached consensus on eight EIPs to build for the Shanghai hard fork. Not all eight EIPs might ship with the final upgrade expected in the second half of 2023. Also, ETH coders did not finalize a timeline for staked Ether withdrawals.\u00a0",

    "description": "Iran arrested Voria Ghafouri on Thursday over his criticism of the regime, as mass protests cast a shadow over the squad's World Cup ambitions.",
    "content": "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates \u2014 Iran arrested a prominent former member of its national soccer team on Thursday over his criticism of the government as authorities grapple with nationwide protests that have cast a shadow over its competition at the World Cup. The semiofficial Fars and Tasnim news agencies reported that Voria Ghafouri was arrested for \u201cinsulting the national soccer team and propagandizing against the government.\u201d Ghafouri, who was not chosen to go to the World Cup, has been an outspoken critic of Iranian authorities throughout his career. He objected to a longstanding ban on women spectators at men\u2019s soccer matches as well as Iran\u2019s confrontational foreign policy, which has led to crippling Western sanctions. [time-brightcove not-tgx=\u201dtrue\u201d] Read More: Iran\u2019s World Cup Team Remained Silent During Their National Anthem More recently, he expressed sympathy for the family of a 22-year-old woman whose death while in the custody of Iran\u2019s morality police ignited the latest protests. In recent days he also called for an end to a violent crackdown on protests in Iran\u2019s western Kurdistan region. The reports of his arrest came ahead of Friday\u2019s World Cup match between Iran and Wales. At Iran\u2019s opening match, a 6-2 loss to England, the members of the Iranian national team declined to sing along to their national anthem and some fans expressed support for the protests. The protests were ignited by the Sept. 16 death of Mahsa Amini, a Kurdish woman arrested by the morality police in the capital, Tehran. They rapidly escalated into nationwide demonstrations calling for the overthrow of the Islamic Republic. The western Kurdish region of the country, where both Amini and Ghafouri are from, has been the epicenter of the protests. Shops were closed in the region on Thursday following calls for a general strike. Iranian officials have not said whether Ghafouri\u2019s activism was a factor in not choosing him for the national team. He plays for the Khuzestan Foolad team in the southwestern city of Ahvaz. The protests show no sign of waning, and mark one of the biggest challenges to Iran\u2019s ruling clerics since the 1979 Islamic Revolution that brought them to power. Rights groups say security forces have used unleashed live ammunition and bird shot on the protesters, as well as beating and arresting them, with much of the violence captured on video. At least 442 protesters have been killed and more than 18,000 detained since the start of the unrest, according to Human Rights Activists in Iran, a group that has been monitoring the protests. The U.N. Human Rights Council voted Thursday to condemn the crackdown and to create an independent fact-finding mission to investigate alleged abuses, particularly those committed against women and children. Read More: Iran Has a Long History of Protest and Activism Authorities have blamed the unrest on hostile foreign powers, without providing evidence, and say separatists and other armed groups have attacked security forces. Human Rights Activists in Iran says at least 57 security personnel have been killed, while state media have reported a higher toll. The protesters say they are fed up after decades of social and political repression, including a strict dress code imposed on women. Young women have played a leading role in the protests, stripping off the mandatory Islamic headscarf to express their rejection of clerical rule. Some Iranians are actively rooting against their own team at the World Cup, associating it with rulers they view as violent and corrupt. Others insist the national team, which includes players who have spoken out on social media in solidarity with the protests, represents the country\u2019s people. The team\u2019s star forward, Sardar Azmoun, who has been vocal about the protests online, was on the bench during the opening match. In addition to Ghafouri, two other former soccer stars have been arrested for expressing support for the protests. Read More: Weary and Thirsty, World Cup Fans Try to Find Joy at a Complicated Tournament Other Iranian athletes have also been drawn into the struggle. Iranian rock climber Elnaz Rekabi competed without wearing the mandatory headscarf at an international competition in South Korea in October, a move widely seen as expressing support for the protests. She received a hero\u2019s welcome from protesters upon returning to Iran, even as she told state media the move was \u201cunintentional\u201d in an interview that may have been given under duress. Earlier this month, Iran\u2019s football federation threatened to punish players on its beach soccer team after it defeated Brazil at an international competition in Dubai. One of the players had celebrated after scoring a goal by mimicking a female protester cutting off her hair.",

    "content": "It is with a very strong bullish move that T bulls break through the $0.0209 resistance level. But the bullish momentum reduces as it encounters a strong resistance at $0.021 and then the price pulls back briefly. The bullish price, however, continues to take up new levels until the price hits a brick wall at $0.0216 the bull market triggers massive selling pressure, but with the new support which is forming at $0.021, buyers attempt to cut short the bearish move, but they eventually failed. According to the RSI line, the momentum of the market continues to range at around 37. After the bulls were able to dam the falling price, they now seek for support price level with which they will reclaim their ground in the market. buyers and sellers are engaged in a serious tug-of-war at the moment, but it seems like the support level still continues to hold strongly at $0.0207. From here, the buyers are trying to expand the narrow price channel by pushing back the resistance level.",

    "content": "The post Bitcoin Ignites New Decline, Could Soon Fall Below $16,000! appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto markets have turned extremely volatile and uncertain ever since the popular exchange FTX collapsed and created a ripple of fallouts. Meanwhile, Bitcoin and popular altcoins attempted to begin with a recovery phase, but the bears perceived the fact of their growing dominance despite minor bounces. Therefore, bearish clouds continue to hover over the Bitcoin (BTC) price which may drag the price back below $16,000 in a net couple of hours! This is Why Bitcoin(BTC) Price May Resume its Downtrend! Bitcoin price was struggling hard to clear the resistance at $17,000 compelled the price to form a double top pattern, As a result, the rejection surfaced, diving the prices lower close to $16,400 at the moment which may be extended below $16,000 very soon.\u00a0 The BTC price broke down from the rising wedge which is largely considered bearish and heading towards the lower support close to $16,300. Meanwhile, if a flip occurs above these levels, then the bulls may regain dominance and uplift the price above $16,500 which appears unlikely presently.\u00a0 However, the mounted bearish sentiments and pressure are likely to drive the prices lower while the bulls may fail to hold the pivotal $16,000, hitting the levels around $15,850.\u00a0 Where Will the Bitcoin form its Bottoms? Bitcoin price ever since began to drop off its 2022 highs, has been maintaining a pattern of being rejected at certain levels. As per a popular analyst, Moustache, BTC price has been constantly rejected at the Mayer multiple lines. Hence after the recent rejection, it was proven that the price may continue to dive towards the south, testing the lower support levels.\u00a0 pic.twitter.com/LlEF0ZEAUs\u2014 \ud835\udd44\ud835\udd60\ud835\udd66\ud835\udd64\ud835\udd65\ud835\udd52\ud835\udd54\u24d7\ud835\udd56 (@el_crypto_prof) November 24, 2022 Hence, the analyst believes that the Bitcoin (BTC) price may continue to plunge hard and reclaim the levels lower to the current support zones. Meanwhile, the bulls may also try hard to hold the price but if extreme bearish pressure mounts, the buying volume may not compensate which may propel the price lower in the next 12 to 16 hours.\u00a0",

    "content": "The post What Investors Need To Know About Why This Crypto Winter Is Distinct? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Lots of new money flooded into the cryptocurrency market in 2021, just in time for the first \u201ccrypto winter.\u201d Investors have found that this crypto winter is hitting them harder than previous ones. Experts say that this is because a lot of new investors got into the market last year, along with a complex mix of unrealistic expectations and the market\u2019s expected volatility. The present \u201ccrypto winter,\u201d according to experts, may endure for quite some time. Read on to find out what that implies for your investment portfolio. In Other Words, What Exactly Is A Crypto Winter? According to Piers Ridyard, CEO of RDX Works in Switzerland, the bear market in previous cryptocurrencies is known as \u201ccrypto winter.\u201d A bear market, he explains, is not the same thing as a crypto winter. A bear market occurs when prices fall, while a crypto winter describes a period of inactivity. Ridyard says that an investor would get nothing back during a crypto winter and would lose money during a bear market. Even though the market has made up some of its deficits over the past few months, many individuals may have seen their portfolio returns remain flat or even fall short of expectations. You should also keep in mind that crypto winters, like bear markets in the stock market, are pretty much a permanent part of the cryptocurrency market. The Experts Explain Why This Crypto Winter Is Different The consensus among industry professionals is that we are currently experiencing a \u201ccrypto winter\u201d and that buyers should brace themselves for periods of stagnant or even declining market value. Further, he claims that people\u2019s frustration stems from their inability to grasp the situation. Ways For Surviving Crypto Winter What you can do to weather a crypto winter is similar to what you would do to weather a stock market decline. While waiting for the economy to rebound or in preparation for the next crypto winter, experts recommend these steps for crypto investors. Diversify Investments Cole argues that those looking to invest in cryptocurrencies should prioritise portfolio diversity. Take This Time To Get Back To Basics The expert believes that the crypto winter is an excellent time for investors to catch their breath and learn about the latest developments in the cryptocurrency sectors, such as the-ekrona.com. So, now is a wonderful moment to study the techniques and principles that drive the cryptographic sector. Do Some Research\u00a0 To ensure that you are putting your money into crypto initiatives with lasting worth or practicality, it is recommended that you conduct your own due diligence. Since they are the most popular and well-known, most experts advise sticking with Bitcoin and Ethereum. In Conclusion As we know, cryptocurrencies are highly volatile, and there is some risk regarding investment. Another expert, Dr. Johnson, warns that cryptocurrency investing is a high-risk endeavour for the vast majority of people. For this reason, you should only invest funds in the cryptocurrency market that you can afford to lose. Disclaimer: This is a guest post.

    "content": "Disney+/Getty Images/Ringer illustration The second Marvel Studios Special Presentation, after \u2018Werewolf by Night,\u2019 solidifies the format as the MCU\u2019s Swiss army knife The Guardians of the Galaxy are back for another adventure. Except this time, they\u2019re not saving the galaxy from the threat of a Kree renegade wielding an Infinity Stone, or a godlike Celestial, or a genocidal purple alien with some bold plans to combat overpopulation issues. No, this time, the Guardians are here to save Christmas. And the only way to do that involves kidnapping Kevin Bacon. This is the delightfully absurd premise behind The Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special, which premiered on Disney+ on Friday. With the glaring exception of Gamora, the entire Guardians gang returns for the occasion, along with the addition of Cosmo the Spacedog (voiced by Maria Bakalova) and a version of Groot who is now alarmingly swole. Written and directed by James Gunn, the 42-minute TV special marks the first time the MCU\u2019s motliest crew has appeared together under Gunn\u2019s direction since 2017\u2019s Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2. (Since then, Gunn was fired and rehired by Marvel Studios; during his exile from Marvel, he began his work at DC Films, and last month he was named co-chair and co-CEO of DC Studios, making him responsible for guiding the DCEU into a new era.) It\u2019s also the last time the Guardians will appear on screen before Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3, which will serve as the conclusion to Gunn\u2019s Guardians trilogy when it\u2019s released in May 2023. The holiday special was filmed concurrently with Vol. 3, and while it\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess as to what the future holds for the Guardians after that, the special provided an additional opportunity for Gunn and the rest of the Guardians team to have some fun before concluding the trilogy\u2019s arc. \u201cVol. 3 is actually a pretty emotional movie, it\u2019s heavy in a lot of ways,\u201d Gunn tells The Ringer. \u201cWe still have all of the fun of the Guardians, but with a serious story. And just making a film is a little more painstaking\u2014you gotta get all the shots exactly right. Whereas [the holiday special], to us, was a blast. It was almost like our days off. Every few days we would shoot Vol. 3, and then every few days we\u2019d shoot this. It was a lot of fun to shoot and make in general. It\u2019s just so goofy and so not serious, it made the stakes much lower when we were doing it.\u201d Although the TV special\u2019s reveal that Mantis and Peter Quill are related comes as something of a shock, it doesn\u2019t feature any Earth-shattering developments that will change the entire course of Vol. 3 or the MCU at large. Instead, it offers a light-hearted, low-stakes side quest that features some potentially crucial character and relationship developments, while also helping to make the case for Marvel\u2019s new streaming format. The Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special is just the second entry in Marvel Studios\u2019 Special Presentations series, following the release of Werewolf by Night in October. In early 2021, Marvel made the transition to producing TV at the start of Phase 4 with WandaVision, and these Special Presentations represent the studio\u2019s latest attempt to diversify its programming as it releases content faster than ever. As self-contained stories that have run between 40 and 53 minutes, they\u2019re like souped-up versions of Marvel One-Shots, a series of short films that were released from 2011 to 2014 as bonus features for MCU movies and allowed filmmakers to both fill in narrative gaps and experiment with characters and concepts. The Special Presentations now provide an even bigger canvas for new characters and ideas to be introduced to the MCU, as well as the chance to focus on otherwise secondary characters, while not necessarily having to worry about the same narrative and financial stakes that come with big-budget theatrical releases or six-to-nine-episode series. In the Guardians Holiday Special, this all translates to the chance to watch Drax and Mantis return to Earth to visit the Hollywood Walk of Fame, party, and most importantly, abduct Kevin Bacon in frightening fashion. \u201cDrax the Destroyer and Mantis have been really background characters for quite a few movies now,\u201d Gunn says. \u201cBeing able to give them an opportunity to take center stage, in all of their anarchic glory, was one of the things that excited me about telling this story. And we didn\u2019t have the pressure of making a multi-hundred-million-dollar movie starring Drax and Mantis. We were able to do it in TV, where it\u2019s contained.\u201d Before Drax and Mantis stole Kevin Bacon\u2019s Christmas, Werewolf by Night teased the potential of the Special Presentations format when it landed on Disney+ ahead of Halloween. Directed by Oscar-winning composer Michael Giacchino, Werewolf by Night is an entertaining homage to the monster movies of the 1930s and 1940s, one fittingly styled in black and white with an admirable commitment to the charming cheesiness of that film era. If it weren\u2019t for the direct reference to the Avengers in its narrated introduction, it wouldn\u2019t have been easy to tell that the TV special belonged in the MCU. It features and focuses entirely on new characters from lesser-known Marvel properties, like Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal\u2019s Jack Russell, who hails from the special\u2019s 1970s namesake comics series. And while some of the characters and monsters who appear in the special may end up being important to the future of the MCU (especially as the debut of an all-new Blade approaches), Werewolf by Night works well as a stand-alone project, largely because it feels like such a stylistic departure from the Marvel norms. Unlike Werewolf by Night, though, the Guardians Holiday Special doesn\u2019t exist in what feels like its own corner of the MCU. Rather, it\u2019s an extension of a story that\u2019s more than a decade in the making, with the Guardians having previously appeared in a pair of stand-alone films, along with Infinity War and Endgame, plus a collective cameo in this year\u2019s Thor: Love and Thunder. This context provided a unique opportunity for Gunn and Co. to create a self-contained story, while also laying down some narrative foundations for the next movie to build on. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of stuff that we\u2019re Trojan horsing into Guardians Vol. 3 by way of the Christmas special,\u201d Gunn explains. \u201c[Peter and Mantis\u2019s] relationship, but also the fact that they bought Knowhere from the Collector\u2014this is where they live, this is their headquarters. The fact that they have a telekinetic dog, who is a big part of the landscape of Knowhere; the way in which Nebula has taken on much more of a leadership role in the group; how Kraglin is a very important part of the team. We get to see all of these things in the Christmas special that then are sort of taken for granted by the time we get to Vol. 3, and I don\u2019t have to spend a lot of time at the beginning of the movie explaining them.\u201d Marvel Studios has yet to officially announce any plans to develop more Special Presentations, and it isn\u2019t clear whether additional projects would continue to be limited to movie-adjacent releases and holiday themes. But the Guardians Holiday Special and Werewolf by Night have both showcased the framework\u2019s potential in different ways, and it may prove to be a promising narrative space in which filmmakers can enjoy extra creative freedom, and secondary characters can get a chance to shine without having an entire Disney+ series dedicated to them. The MCU\u2019s Phase 5 is expected to kick off on February 17 with Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, but you never know; maybe we\u2019ll get the surprise gift of another Special Presentation with Wong: A Love Story by Valentine\u2019s Day.",

    "content": "The post Is the Binance SAFU Fund Safe? Willy Woo Raises Concerns appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Following the FTX and Alameda implosion, Willy Woo \u2013 a famous Bitcoin on-chain analyst \u2013 has raised concerns over the Binance insurance fund. According to Woo, Binance\u2019s use of BNB coin as part of the crypto insurance fund is much more like FTX using FTT tokens for the same purpose. Hereby raising concerns over the 1,230,769 BNB ( ~$367 million) included in the Binance insurance fund. Woo calls out the Binance cryptocurrency exchange for using BNB in its insurance fund instead of including more Bitcoins. Notably, Binance\u2019s SAFU insurance fund has allocated approximately 24 percent \u2013 worth around $276 million \u2013 to the Bitcoin market. Nonetheless, Binance Smart Chain proponents have argued that BSC has more intrinsic value than FTX cryptocurrency exchange. Furthermore, according to data from DeFillama, BSC has approximately $5.59 in TVL with 502 decentralised application protocols. Closer Look at Binance SAFU Fund Centralized cryptocurrency exchanges are fighting to retain traders as more flee towards DEXs like Uniswap and PancakeSwap. Moreover, the FTX fallout has significantly shattered crypto traders\u2019 confidence in CEXs. Given the circumstances, centralized cryptocurrency exchanges are publishing their proof-of-reserves with the support of on-chain data. Mind you; blockchain data has the characteristic of being incorruptible. Binance, the largest crypto exchange by daily traded volume, has led in CEX transparency. The company established its Secure Asset Fund for Users (SAFU) in 2018 to protect users\u2019 funds. Over the years, the company has gained regulatory trust for protecting customers\u2019 funds and reporting bad actors to law enforcement. As a result, the company takes pride in over 120 million registered users.\u00a0 Notably, the crypto market houses around 300 million global users. Side Notes\u00a0 The Binance ecosystem has outperformed most crypto projects following the FTX fallout. According to our latest crypto price oracles, BNB exchanged hands at around $299, up 11.5 percent in the past seven days. With a market capitalization of approximately $48,765,145,681, the BNB market reported a 24-hour trading volume of around $903 million. Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) has continued to advocate for transparency and security in the blockchain industry. Following the FTX collapse, Binance topped its SAFU fund to $1 billion. To adjust to recent price fluctuations, #Binance has topped up the #SAFU insurance fund to $1 billion USD equivalent again.BUSD AND BNB address about 700m: https://t.co/OMoB6HeR6rBTC address 300m: https://t.co/6kOJ1MZhMMTransparency. 1/2\u2014 CZ Binance (@cz_binance) November 9, 2022 Nonetheless, the urgent and persistent question is whether Binance should have BNB coins on its SAFU fund. From my perspective, Binance should not use BNB as part of the insurance fund. However, this element is arguable and depends on your crypto interaction.",

    "content": "Crowds returned to malls and Michigan Avenue on Black Friday, hunting for something that often seemed elusive: deals to make up for the inflation that has made everyday life more expensive this year. Though shoppers filled stores Friday, many said they were disappointed not to find more eye-popping savings, especially given how pricey groceries, gas and other essentials have been in recent months. Others said they were there mostly for the experience, and are doing much of their holiday shopping online this year, taking advantage of deals offered throughout the fall and winter, rather than just on Black Friday. Advertisement Experts expect this shopping season will be a big one, with holiday retail spending in November and December projected to grow 6% to 8% \u2015 well above the average for the last decade, according to the National Retail Federation. But now, shoppers are increasingly looking for deals earlier, with Black Friday representing the halfway point of the shopping season rather than the kickoff, according to the federation. Many shoppers are also looking for discounts online. On Black Friday alone, consumers spent $7.28 billion as of 5 p.m., according to Adobe. This Black Friday was expected to set a record for online sales for the day, Adobe said. Advertisement People walk past stores in the 500 block of North Michigan Avenue in Chicago on Nov. 25, 2022. (John J. Kim / Chicago Tribune) In Chicago, online shopping may have helped taper out early morning crowds at Water Tower Place. The mall was nearly empty until 11 a.m. For shoppers like Derek and Stacey Suvlette, that was a good thing. While they said they are primarily scouting out deals online, the Indianapolis couple wanted to take their 7-year-old daughter Scout for the experience of in-person shopping in the city during their visit. Stacey Suvlette said they normally avoid the stores because of crowds. The first stop for the family was the Lego store for Scout, who was carrying a bag of purchases. \u201cThis is what she wanted to do today,\u201d Stacey Suvlette said. She said she planned to jump on her computer and check for more deals, mainly \u201cChristmas surprises\u201d for her daughter, once she returned to their hotel. Jackie and Justin Perun, from Naples, Florida, brought their two young children out for similar reasons, wanting to give them the holiday shopping experience. Jackie Perun said it was their first year doing it as a family of four. She admitted that some of the joy and excitement of Black Friday has simmered down over the years due to the convenience of online shopping, which she does too. The pre-sales make Christmas shopping easier, she said. They\u2019ve been looking out for a blue flatbed truck her oldest, whom she calls a \u201cbig truck guy.\u201d \u201cI feel like stores, in general, have been doing such a great job with pre-sales,\u201d she said. \u201cBut other than that, if we see things here that catch our eye, we\u2019ll go for it because stores have different sales in store versus online. It\u2019s hard because with little ones, you just don\u2019t want to disappoint.\u201d Anne DiCanio, 26, of Elmhurst, and her family also went shopping Friday at Woodfield Mall in Schaumburg, mostly for the experience, following a yearslong tradition for their family. Advertisement They met there at 6 a.m. but they didn\u2019t expect to find any doorbusters. People take a shopping break at Woodfield Mall in Schaumburg on Nov. 25, 2022. (Michael Blackshire / Chicago Tribune) Rather \u201cthe earlier we come, the more time we get to spend together,\u201d said DiCanio\u2019s aunt, Janeen Kroll, 49, of Chicago\u2019s Dunning neighborhood. The tradition is so important to them, that in 2020, early in the pandemic, the group gathered at Kroll\u2019s house to shop online together. \u201cIf all of us don\u2019t leave with Christmas gifts today, I don\u2019t think any of us would be upset,\u201d said DiCanio as the group took a lunch break in the food court. Natay Wilfinger, 27, of Crystal Lake, also said this year\u2019s Black Friday was a more mellow for her family than in years past when they would head to stores at 4 a.m. to get freebies and doorbusters. This year, they got to Woodfield around 8:30 a.m. \u201cI don\u2019t miss waking up, I\u2019ll tell you that,\u201d said her brother Quade Wilfinger, 24, of McHenry, as he stood outside a store Friday, taking a break from shopping. Advertisement Now, the \u201cdeals go so long,\u201d said his aunt Karin Dietz, 57, of Cary. Some shoppers, including Brandy Lorenzo, 43, of Huntley, combined online and in-person shopping Friday. While she waited in line for a boba tea for her 12-year-old daughter at Woodfield, she bought shoes on her phone. In Victoria\u2019s Secret, she ordered an item online that she couldn\u2019t find in the store. \u201cI thought it was convenient,\u201d Lorenzo said. Black Friday shoppers wait in line at Oak Brook Center on Nov. 25, 2022. (Michael Blackshire / Chicago Tribune) Some shoppers, however, say they miss the days of racing to the mall to grab predawn deals and steep one-day discounts, especially as they grapple with inflation. Though the pace of inflation has been slowing, consumer prices were up 7.7% in October when compared with the same time last year, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. At Water Tower Place, Colette Williams remembered the early wake-up times to catch doorbuster deals. This year, Williams and her relatives were surprised to find that stores were opening later and the deals weren\u2019t as competitive as they once were. \u201cI remember standing in line at 5 in the morning at Best Buy because there was some video game my kids wanted,\u201d Williams said. \u201cMy husband would get coffee for us, and we would trade off. But there\u2019s not any of that.\u201d Advertisement Some consumers say they\u2019ve adjusted their gifting plans this year, given inflation and the lack of doorbusters. . Advertisement \u201cIt\u2019s tough,\u201d said Dawn Morris, 55, of Belvidere, as she shopped with her daughter, son-in-law and 5-year-old granddaughter at Woodfield. Usually, \u201cwe go all out on Christmas gifts. This year we cut back majorly.\u201d She was disappointed not to find any great deals or doorbusters Friday, despite beginning her shopping before dawn. Brianna Hunter, 24, of Lake in the Hills, said she and her family have also felt the pinch in recent months. \u201cWe\u2019re budgeting more, especially with food prices,\u201d she said. She said she\u2019s trying to focus on quality over quantity when holiday shopping this year, buying fewer items, but making sure they\u2019re nice ones. Hunter, her sister and mother scored a few holiday gifts at Woodfield but still felt some sticker shock at the prices. \u201cImagine how much it would be if it weren\u2019t Black Friday,\u201d said her mother Sheila Hunter, 54, of some of their purchases. While doorbusters may be of the past, Lizzy Paton said Black Friday is still a big day for her 13-year-old Abi, who has been saving up for a pair of Golden Goose sneakers. Advertisement Paton and her two daughters and mother started their day early down at State Street and eventually came to Water Tower Place to make the main purchase. \u201cWe love the holidays, and we want to make the most of it,\u201d she said. \u201cBlack Friday shopping is always part of that.\u201d In recent years, Paton said she\u2019s noticed fewer stores and shoppers at Water Tower Place. This year, she also was surprised to find stores opening much later. They were lounging at a seating area in the mall, waiting for Golden Goose to open at 10 a.m. She said with pre-sales, her daughter could have bought the shoes much earlier. \u201cIt\u2019s a big deal for her to buy them herself, so we just didn\u2019t want to buy them online,\u201d Paton said. lschencker@chicagotribune.com Advertisement joanderson@chicagotribune.com",

    "description": "The Artemis I mission deployed ten CubeSat's as part of its mission, but only four appear to be operational. The post What Happened to those CubeSats that were Launched with Artemis I? appeared first on Universe Today.",
    "content": "NASA made history on November 16th when the Artemis I mission took off from Launch Complex 39B at Cape Canaveral, Florida, on its way to the Moon. This uncrewed mission is testing the capabilities of the Space Launch System (SLS) and Orion spacecraft in preparation for the long-awaited return to the Moon in 2025 (the Artemis III mission). Rather than astronauts, this mission carries a group of mannequins with sensors and has a primary payload consisting of the Callisto technology demonstrator (a human-machine video interface system). As a secondary payload, Artemis I also brought ten 6U CubeSats beyond Low Earth Orbit (LEO), three of which were NASA missions designed to perform experiments. The rest were built by partner space agencies, commercial space entities, research institutes, and universities to carry out a variety of unique deep-space science experiments. While all these satellites managed to deploy successfully, six have not made contact with controllers on the ground or since experienced problems, and their whereabouts remain unknown. The three NASA missions include the BioSentinel, which was designed, built, and tested by engineers at NASA\u2019s Ames and will measure the effects of deep-space radiation on DNA using yeast organisms. The second is the Lunar Flashflight, a technology demonstrator developed at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) with support from the Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC), the Goddard Space Flight Center, and the Georgia Institute of Technology. Its purpose is to look for surface water ice in the permanently-shadowed regions near the lunar south pole and test out new spacecraft technologies. The third is the NEA Scout mission developed by the NASA Marshal Space Flight Center in partnership with NASA JPL, with support from NASA Goddard, the Johnson Space Center, and the Langley Research Center. The purpose of the mission is twofold: one, to demonstrate solar sail deployment; and two, to demonstrate solar sail navigation by rendezvousing (and characterizing) the near-earth asteroid (NEA) 2020 GE. The other missions include the following: ArgoMoon: Contributed by the European Space Agency (ESA) and ArgoTec, an Italian aerospace company. This CubeSat aims to observe the SLS interim cryogenic propulsion stage with advanced optics and software imaging systems.CuSP: Contributed by the Southwest Research Institute (SwRI), this satellite is a \u201cspace weather\u201d mission that will measure solar particles and magnetic fields.EQUULEUS: This satellite was developed by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) and the University of Tokyo to image Earth\u2019s plasmasphere and study Earth\u2019s radiation environment from the Earth-Moon L2 point.Lunar IceCube: Developed by Morehead State University, this CubeSat will search for lunar water and other volatiles using an infrared spectrometer.LunaH-Map: This satellite, contributed by Arizona State University, will use neutron spectrometers to create higher-fidelity maps of near-surface hydrogen in permanently-shadowed craters and other regions near the lunar South Pole.Linux: Developed by Lockheed Martin, this mission will conduct advanced infrared imaging of the lunar surface.OMOTENASHI: Developed by JAXA, this lunar lander (the smallest ever deployed) will study the lunar environment.Team Miles: Developed by Florida-based aerospace company Miles Space, this demonstrator will test plasma thrusters and compete in NASA\u2019s Deep Space Derby Centennial Challenge (formerly the Cube Quest Challenge). NASA\u2019s Lunar Flashlight CubeSat undergoing tests at a Georgia Tech clean room. Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech. All ten CubeSats successfully deployed from the Interim Cryogenic Propulsion Stage (ICPS), an adapter attached to the SLS\u2019s upper stage. On November 18th, NASA officials confirmed that ArgoMoon, Biosentinel, Equuleus, LunaH-Map, and OMOTENASHI were all operational, though OMOTENASHI began experiencing problems since then. On November 24th, NASA reported that the NEA Scout mission still hadn\u2019t made contact. This prompted the mission controllers to deploy the CubeSat\u2019s sail ahead of schedule, hoping it will be visible to ground-based telescopes. In short, only four satellites were deployed and successfully established communications with their controllers back on Earth. The teams behind the remaining six missions are currently troubleshooting various solutions and are waiting to learn more. But as time has taught us, such is the nature of CubeSat missions, which are inherently high-risk and high-reward. And it may be premature at this point to count out all the missions that have experienced problems.

    "content": "The post Black Swan Author Reveals The Real Reason Behind Catastrophic Crypto Crisis appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Nassim Taleb \u2013 an award-winning philosopher \u2013 has called out the cryptocurrency market again following the FTX implosion. The famous author thinks Bitcoin is a tumor and can soon present investors with an unprecedented deleveraging scenario. Moreover, Taleb has indicated no significant cash flow in the cryptocurrency market. As such, the former options trader and risk analyst thinks the crypto market is in a liquidity crisis. Notably, a liquidity crisis is described as a financial situation characterized by a lack of cash at hand across many financial institutions simultaneously. Furthermore, most crypto companies \u2013 including Binance exchange \u2013 use their native tokens for insurance funds. The trend has been questioned as irrational since most crypto projects either pre-mined their tokens or control the largest hash power. Through a series of tweets, Taleb indicated that blockchain technology has not flourished to generate significant cash flow, particularly during bear markets. Instead, Taleb thinks that the cash circulating in the cryptocurrency industry is from other crypto projects. 2) The point is that the blockchain, in spite of all the hype, has not managed to produce anything directly useful to produce cash flow. The income is circular, from crypto-to-crypto, with some suckers in between.\u2014 Nassim Nicholas Taleb (@nntaleb) November 24, 2022 The decline in crypto cash flow can be attributed mainly to the FTX fallout and the DCG\u2019s impending implosion. Furthermore, millions of crypto traders and investors were stranded by the FTX collapse, with the investigations taking slower than anticipated. Closer Look at Crypto Market Outlook\u00a0 According to the latest crypto price oracles, the total cryptocurrency market capitalization stands at around $868 billion. Additionally, the total reported crypto trading volume in the past 24 hours stands at approximately $44.7 billion. The huge difference indicates that most crypto assets are used for speculative purposes and have been stored for later use. As such, most cryptocurrency community continues to disregard Taleb\u2019s opinions. Furthermore, speculation is part of the grey area that the cryptocurrency market thrives on. One of Taleb\u2019s opinion comments argues that the Bitcoin market should be compared to the Gold and oil industry that all have different intrinsic values. Moreover, the Bitcoin industry has significantly opened up locked-up economies. Does gold have cash flow? Or oil? It seems utility of the asset should be considered.Granted, most cryptos are useless ponzis, but they aren't inherently useless/without value.If they make the storing or transfer of money (especially in the 3rd world) easier, they have value.\u2014 THE INVESTOR'S GATE (@Investors_Gate) November 25, 2022 According to tech billionaire Elon Musk, Bitcoin will thrive long-term, but the ongoing bear market will last long. The reduced cash flow highlighted by Taleb is a culmination of the past major on-chain activities. Furthermore, global confidence in the cryptocurrency market has significantly been shaken. Nonetheless, every cryptocurrency trader must conduct proper research and form personal opinions before purchasing or investing in the digital asset economy.",

    "content": "EY\u2019s global blockchain leader says that for the first time ever, crypto\u2019s price swings do not have that big of an impact on the long-term growth of the industry. Nonetheless, he stressed: \u201cIt is also important that regulators crack down on obvious Ponzi schemes faster and with more severity.\u201d EY\u2019s Brody on Crypto Winter Paul Brody, global blockchain leader at EY, discussed the crypto winter, the need for regulation, and the collapse of crypto exchange FTX in an interview published by the Mint publication Thursday. He was asked whether he expects the current crypto winter to be over soon. \u201cThis is a much milder crypto winter than the last one,\u201d he replied. \u201cOne of the major features of this winter is that there is a decoupling going on between the price of crypto assets and product and engineering development work that is going on in the crypto industry.\u201d The EY executive opined: For the first time ever, price ups and downs don\u2019t have that big of an impact on the long-term growth of the industry. We are slowly moving away from the pure financial focus of the industry. He added that the Ethereum ecosystem is now much more focused on application development, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). Brody on FTX Collapse and the Need for Crypto Regulation The EY executive also discussed the collapse of crypto exchange FTX, which some have compared to Ponzi schemes, including the infamous one run by Bernie Madoff. Responding to a question about whether users can trust crypto exchanges following the FTX meltdown, he cautioned: \u201cThe idea behind crypto was that it is fully transparent since it is on the blockchain and you can see if something bad happened. That was a flawed theory. Seeing data doesn\u2019t mean you can understand the complex data flow in smart contracts.\u201d \u201cEntities that have tried to blend on-chain and off-chain financial transactions without robust regulatory oversight are the ones that are not doing well,\u201d Brody continued. \u201cIt\u2019s been impossible to know if your assets are strictly being held and used for you, or if they are being pledged and used in other scenarios,\u201d the EY blockchain leader warned. \u201cThe key takeaway is that your governance has to be either simple enough for people to follow or you can take a rigorously audited and publicly traded approach.\u201d He also emphasized the need for stricter regulation, stating: It is also important that regulators crack down on obvious Ponzi schemes faster and with more severity. I would like to see more regulatory activity and rules that good players can follow. Following the meltdown of FTX, many people have called on regulators in various jurisdictions to tighten their oversight. Bank of England Deputy Governor for Financial Stability Sir Jon Cunliffe stressed this week that the FTX collapse has highlighted the urgent need for tighter regulation. The White House and several U.S. senators have called for proper crypto oversight. A U.S. lawmaker recently urged the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to take decisive action to regulate the crypto industry. What do you think about the comments by EY\u2019s executive?

On Friday, AMC released three separate motion posters to its official Twitter account for the Immortal Universe (including Interview With the Vampire) with each poster hinting at the mysterious and supernatural goings on within the crumbling old Southern mansion.The first poster asked, \"Have you heard of the old Mayfair house...\" and featured some sort of shadowy figure passing behind the stained glass of the doors. The second told fans to \"feel the darkness. Feel the light\" and featured a shadowy figure turning out the light and the third warned that \"the witching hour is almost upon us\" before a flock of birds fly directly at the viewer. You can check them out for yourself below. Have you heard of the old Mayfair house...? #MayfairWitches pic.twitter.com/F8aOlcqR9O-- Interview with the Vampire (@Immortal_AMC) November 25, 2022 Feel the darkness.

As she grapples with her newfound powers, she must contend with a sinister presence that has haunted her family for generations. Written by Esta Spalding and Michelle Ashford, the series also stars Harry Hamlin, Annabeth Gish, Tongayi Chirisa, Beth Grant, Jen Richards, and Jack Huston.\"The first season starts where the book starts, in that mood of New Orleans and the sort of ghost story of this house,\" showrunner Esta Spalding previously said about the series. \"We meet really quickly Rowan Fielding who's the main character of the first book and through the series.\"She continued, \"The middle section is about 300 or 400 pages of 13 generations of witches going all the way back to Scotland. We used a piece of that, and then we feel like we're gonna save some of that great story and saga of all the different generations for later seasons, should we be so lucky.\"How is the series influenced by Rice's novel, The Witching Hour?Speaking with ComicBook.com at New York Comic Con about the upcoming series, Jack Huston and Harry Hamlin both spoke about how the series is in influenced by Rice's novel rather than a direct adaptation.\"I downloaded it. I saw that it was 56 hours long and I thought, do I have 56 hours, you know, and I listened to nine hours, and I realized that really what we have here is an interpretive show,\" Hamlin said about how he prepared for the series. \"The characters are not exactly the same as they are in the book. The story's not exactly same. They've taken the whole ethos of the witches and The Witching Hour, the first book, and they. have compiled it into what is a really wonderful, engaging television show. It's not a book. It's a TV show.\"When asked about the network's plans to adapt the other two books in the series, Lasher and Taltos, Huston said that the thinks there are indeed plans but also noted that not everything can go from page to screen, especially with books as rich as Rice's{replyCount}comments\"I think there's plans and question it's all gonna depend on you know, people's response to it. I think we've done something really daring. I think something very cool,\" Huston said. \"As Harry was saying, you know, the books themselves are dense. You know, brilliant, sort of like a literary feat, but you know, you can't put all of that in right TV series, but you can be inspired by it. You can be influenced and inspired in many ways. So, you know, I there's definitely plans, you know, in our first season finishes at the same point as The Witching Hour.\"Anne Rice's Mayfair Witches is set to debut on Sunday, January 8th on both AMC, and AMC+.",

    "content": "Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba exploded onto the scene earlier this year with the anime's take on the Entertainment District arc, and now fans are being reminded of just how much of a terror the villain Daki was with some scary good cosplay! It might be hard to remember given just how strong the Fall 2022 anime schedule is bringing an end to the year overall, but 2022 kicked off with the huge adaptation of the Entertainment Distict arc from Koyoharu Gotoge's original manga. It was here that Tanjiro Kamado faced off against their toughest demons yet, with the biggest battles in the anime to date. The Entertainment District arc introduced Tanjiro and the others (and fans) to the first real member of Muzan's Upper Rank demonic forces, and this brother and sister duo nearly killed each of the fan favorite characters. It was a much deadlier battle than anything fans have gotten to see in the anime so far, and Daki managed to carve a huge page with fans as one of the coolest villains of the year overall. Now artist @shaoows on Instagram has brought Daki to life with some perfectly creepy cosplay! Check it out: View this post on Instagram A post shared by Shaoows (@shaoows) What is Coming in Demon Slayer Season 3? Demon Slayer ended its second season with the confirmation that a third season of the series is now in the works. While the third season of the anime has yet to reveal a release window or concrete date for its new slate of episodes, the series has confirmed it will be adapting the Swordsmith Village arc of Koyoharu Gotoge's manga with its new season. Things are only going to get tougher for Tanjiro and the others from here on out.

    "content": "Since the original Avatar was rated PG-13 way back in 2009, it shouldn't be too surprising to viewers that the highly anticipated sequel has earned the same distinction, there is one major different however. Confirmed this week by the Motion Picture Association was the reveal that Avatar: The Way of Water is officially rated PG-13 for the following reasons: \"Sequences of strong violence and intense action, partial nudity and some strong language.\" Though the film seems to share a lot of visual similarities to the first one, the original Avatar's rating was for \"intense epic battle sequences and warfare, sensuality, language and some smoking.\" Thank goodness they cut out the smoking for the sequel.With just a few weeks to go before the release of the highly anticipated movie, the sequel is cutting it close to being ready for theaters. Franchise producer and James Cameron's producing Partner Jon Landau took to social media to confirm that the movie completed post-production just this week. Accompanying a photo of the post-production team on the movie, he wrote: \"Congratulations to the entire Avatar: The Way of Water family. Yesterday we completed our final mix and picture mastering and I snapped this picture of our post finishing team. I am thankful to every one of you for your contributions to the film.\"When will Avatar 2 stream on Disney+?Like so many other movies, the timeline for when Avatar: The Way of Water will stream on Disney+ depends entirely on the box office success of the sequel. Though there's a certain line of thought about interest in a sequel to the first movie since there's a 13 year gap between the two movies. Recent reports revealed that early tracking on the sequel pointed toward an opening weekend well over $100 million, plus the film has been confirmed to premiere in China meaning huge box office returns are nearly a guarantee.The shortest possible window for Avatar 2 arriving on streaming is 45 days, potentially putting the movie on Disney+ in early February. Considering the potential box office that it could bring in however, the movie may not be available for streaming for months afterward since returns could still be very high. As of this writing we just don't know. In any event, director James Cameron remains as confident in his product as ever. Speaking in a previous interview with GQ, Cameron opened up about an argument he had about the first film, telling an executive at the time:\"I said something I've never said to anybody else in the business,\" Cameron began. \"'I think this movie is going to make all the f-cking money. And when it does, it's going to be too late for you to love the film. The time for you to love the movie is today. So I'm not asking you to say something that you don't feel, but just know that I will always know that no matter how complimentary you are about the movie in the future when it makes all the money.'\"{replyCount}commentsHe continued, \"And that's exactly what I said, in caps, 'ALL THE MONEY,' not some of the money, all the f-cking money. I said, 'You can't come back to me and compliment the film or chum along and say, \"Look what we did together.\" You won't be able to do that.' At that point, that particular studio executive flipped out and went bug sh-t on me. And I told him to get the f-ck out of my office. And that's where it was left.\"Avatar: The Way of Water will be released in theaters on December 16th.",

    "content": "A new Nintendo Switch eShop sale that went live for Black Friday and that is live until December 5 discounts one of the best trilogies in gaming to the lowest price it's ever been on the eShop. For whatever reason, we got a plethora of great trilogies during the seventh generation of console gaming, aka during the Nintendo Wii, PS3, and Xbox 360 generation, which was a longer generation than normal due to the global recession that happened during it. During this generation, gamers were gifted with BioShock and its two sequels. That's right, the game in question is BioShock: The Collection. Thanks to the Black Friday Nintendo eShop sale, Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch Lite, and Nintendo Switch OLED users can play all three BioShock games for $9.99. This is a savings of 80 percent, as 2K Games usually requires $49.99 for the trio of classics. \"Experience the unforgettable worlds and monumental stories of the award-winning BioShock series with BioShock: The Collection,\" reads an official elevator pitch of the collection. Journey to the cities of Rapture and Columbia across BioShock Remastered, BioShock 2 Remastered, and BioShock Infinite: The Complete Edition, including all single-player add-on content. Fight for your life and outsmart your enemies, be it deep beneath the waves or high above the clouds.{replyCount}commentsFor those that don't know: BioShock debuted back in 2007 via 2K Boston, which would later go on to become Irrational Games. Created by Kevin Levine, the first-person shooter meets action-adventure game debuted with a 96 on Metacritic, making it one of the highest-rated games of all time. Three years later a sequel, BioShock 2, was released but by a different studio and a different director. Consequently, it wasn't as good, earning an 88 on Metacritic, which is still a great score but it's widely viewed as not as good as the other games in the series. Speaking of the other game in the series, the third and final installment, BioShock Infinite, hit another three years later in 2013. For this one, 2K Boston and Kevin Levine returned. The game earned a 94 on Metacritic.",

Also, price action has continued to move higher towards a more elevated resistance price level. To this effect, let\u2019s further examine this market. Lucky Block V1\u2019s Price: $0.0001633 LBLOCK V1\u2019s Market Capitalization: $6.65 million Lucky Block V1\u2019s Flowing Supply: 40.77 billion Lucky Block V1\u2019s Total Supply: 99.6 billion LBLOCK\u2019s Ranking on Coinmarketcap: #4835 Resistance: $0.0001633, $0.0001653, $0.0001680 Substance: $0.0001613, $0.0001590, $0.0001565 Recent price candles on the four hour market formed above the Exponential Moving Average curve. This price activity is revealing that LBLOCK V1 has more upside potential at this point.

Another technical Indicator called the MACD keeps indicating positivity about upside price movement in this market.

Coming to an hourly market, we can see that the current price stays above the Exponential Moving Average curve. Also, the latest price candle stays bullish and has kept price above the Exponential Moving Average curve. Furthermore, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence indicator seems to have recovered its upward direction. By implication, Lucky Block price action is revealing that buyers are exerting more pressure at their end of the market.

Furthermore, there hasn\u2019t been any attempt to break the resistance upward. However, at this point, it\u2019s like price action is making another attempt to move back upwards. Let\u2019s zoom in for a closer look. UNUS SED LEO value now: $3.91 UNUS SED LEO market cap: $ 3.97 billion LEO moving supply: 953.95 million LEO Total Supply: 985.24 million UNUS SED LEO Coinmarketcap ranking: #18 Resistance: $3.91, $3.95, $4.00 Support: $3.88, $3.85, $3.80 The daily reveals is trying to mount a defense against downward force. This attempt could be seen via the latest green price candlestick on this chart. Also, this event can be seen happening near a strong support of approximately $3.80. However, on the contrary, the RSI indicator seems to still maintain a different opinion about the price of this current market activity. The Stochastic RSI indicator curves have just delivered a bearish crossover, above Level 50. And, this generally portrays that a downward trend may follow in subsequent sessions. Nevertheless, should buying activities continue to increase, technical indicators like this RSI too will adjust to portray it? The UNUS SED LEO/USDT four hours chart Further reveals the struggles that are ongoing between buyers and sellers in this market. Buyers have been able to push the price higher than the sellers have pulled it down. This is seen via the last four price candles on this chart. Consequently, at this point, we can see that buyers are still having the upper hand. Also, the RSI is now moving upwards from the oversold region towards level 20 of the Indicator. Consequently, this reveals that price activities are still weak, and buyers need to exert some more pressure if the price must rise significantly toward the $4.20 price level.

    "content": "Late last year, Kevin Stone received a call asking if he could create a statue of a huge goat with Elon Musk riding a rocket as its head. Metal artist Mr. Stone in British Columbia, Canada, believed the caller was Elon Musk. Mr. Stone, who is frequently commissioned to create metal eagles and dragons, remarked, \u201cI mean, who else would want anything so crazy?\u201d A couple of cryptocurrency business owners made the request. In order to promote their cryptocurrency, the Elon GOAT, Mr. Musk was persuaded to tweet about the sculpture to his more than 118 million followers. According to co-founder of Elon GOAT Ashley Sansalone, \u201cElon tweeting us would validate the token.\u201d It is the most recent publicity gimmick in the cryptocurrency industry, where memes and jokes regarding virtual currencies frequently take over social media. But it\u2019s uncommon to use a 12,000-pound sculpture as a marketing ploy. Elon GOAT\u2019s founders claim that their admiration for Mr. Musk served as the inspiration for the name of their cryptocurrency. They believe he is a \u201cGOAT,\u201d or the \u201cgreatest of all time,\u201d along with his other admirers. They created a sculpture of Mr. Musk\u2019s head on a goat\u2019s body while he was wearing a gold-plated dogecoin necklace for $600,000. The rocket can move and point upward as though it were about to ascend. Flames can erupt out the back thanks to the gas pipes that run through it. The sculpture will be delivered on Saturday to the offices of Tesla Inc. in Austin, Texas, with the expectation that Elon Musk would show up and collect it. The occasion is being dubbed \u201cGOATSgiving\u201d by its organizers. An inquiry for comment from Tesla received no response. Mr. Musk hasn\u2019t acknowledged his resemblance to a four-legged creature or contacted the creators of the token. One of them, Mr. Sansalone, claimed that he runs a construction business and trades energy in addition to working full-time on the token. The Elon GOAT token is not a well-known cryptocurrency, in contrast to bitcoin, ether, or dogecoin. According to CoinMarketCap, it is rated far outside of the top cryptocurrencies by market value. The sculpture\u2019s concept came together last year. Mr. Sansalone, 40, added, \u201cIt was an evening joke that just kind of came to completion.\u201d Mr. Stone created Mr. Musk\u2019s head, which took him close to six months to finish. According to Mr. Sansalone, other people in Phoenix created the goat body and rocket to expedite the process. The components were then assembled and fastened to the back of a semi-truck trailer that was 70 feet long. DeMarco Hill, 51, who resides in Goodyear, Arizona, saw the statue for the first time in September and remarked, \u201cWhen I first saw the statue my jaw dropped,\u201d His 12-year-old son was taken by him, and they began to follow. You had never seen anything like it before, she said. Mr. Sansalone was approached by Mr. Hill, a trucker and owner of Stay Ready Trucking, who found the stunt to be so funny that he asked if he might take part. Only someone with a specific license could go past the towering mound of metal, according to Mr. Sansalone, who claimed Mr. Hill was required. Later, he transported the sculpture to Texas by driving it via California, Arizona, and Washington. Passing motorists beeped their horns or gave the thumbs up. He complained, \u201cIf I pull up to the side of the road, it\u2019s like people are swarming around.\u201d It becomes crazy. Denise McKinney witnessed it pass by last month while purchasing lunch from a taco truck on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles. The 43-year-old author remarked, \u201cMy initial thought was like, \u2018What the heck is this?'\u201d The face was then recognized by her. She reportedly muttered to herself, \u201cUgh, of course Elon Musk is on it.\u201d Mr. Sansalone says that most reactions to the sculpture have been positive. No one has reported mistaking Mr. Musk for someone else, according to him. Mr. Sansalone thinks that the world\u2019s richest man, Elon Musk, who recently acquired Twitter Inc. for $44 billion, is \u201carguably the most relevant person on the planet right now. During Tesla\u2019s artificial intelligence conference in September, the sculpture was displayed in front of the company\u2019s Palo Alto, California, headquarters. At that time Tesla employees crossed the street to take pictures with the artwork. Judging some tweets he posted while at the conference, it seems Mr. Musk was there, and Mr. Sansalone suspects the billionaire noticed the sculpture. He claimed that all that was visible was a lit-up rocket set up in the center of the street. Elon GOAT has been publicizing the Saturday event and tweeting at Mr. Musk for the past month in an effort to give him enough time to travel to Austin, according to Mr. Sansalone. When a flight-tracking service revealed that Mr. Musk\u2019s plane was on its way to Austin on Wednesday, they were encouraged. On Saturday in the late afternoon, they want to deliver the sculpture to Tesla\u2019s corporate offices. It is hoped that Mr. Musk will publicly acknowledge it. Mr. Sansalone claimed he has just one plan in the event that Mr. Musk doesn\u2019t: \u201cGo home and cry.\u201d",

    "content": "Large portions of the cryptocurrency community are now in a state of starvation and sorrow as a result of the FTX crypto exchange\u2019s unexpected billions dollar collapse. Poor retail investors are suffering. Flagship exchanges are in danger of going bankrupt. Critics of crypto are ecstatic. Institutional interest and support seems to be having dealt a major blow, which is the exact contrary to the optimism it had all around it before. Many smaller firms have completely stopped operations in the expectation that people\u2019s focus will ultimately shift. According to Samantha Yap, CEO of cryptocurrency PR agency Yap Global, Another PR professional who worked on a number of significant Defi projects but who wished to remain unnamed for the sake of candor stated it more succinctly: His current only concern is extracting as much money as he can from the industry before it finally collapses. \u201c \u2013 he said. However, if you pay closer attention, you can discern signs of life in this beaten-up elderly dog, such as: an effort was made to generate $1.5 billion for Matrixport; a brand-new $100 million \u201cinstitutional clientele\u201d fund; a private market centered on ApeCoin NFTs. The Japanese central bank is sponsoring some sort of central bank digital money. Alternatively, is crypto slouching toward a new, improved form of itself that can (allegedly) endure future crises or are these really the last, hateful emissions of a dying creature? Kristian Srenson, a serious Danish man who thinks the FTX scandal provides a perfect opportunity for cryptocurrency to break free from its dark past and embrace the warm and rational light of regulatory compliance, is one individual who would answer \u201cyes\u201d with a definite and passionate \u201cyes.\u201d The FTX aftermath has been somewhat advantageous for Srenson, who manages the data analytics company Tokenizer as well as a PR platform concentrating in regulated clients. Since we mostly interact with these regulated players, he explained to me, \u201cmost have tried to profit from the situation.\u201d This is an excellent opportunity to describe what we actually accomplish and how it differs from the more speculative aspects of the industry. According to Srenson, the relative laxity of crypto regulation was the primary contributor to the current catastrophe. He claimed that many businesses run without licenses, and that those that do were carelessly granted without the subsequent and essential auditing. In contrast to get-rich-quick desires, he claimed that the increased scrutiny from authorities today \u201cwould help advance the more healthy side of the industry.\u201d Cover your ears, cypherpunks and Silk Road drug dealers! Srenson\u2019s vision for cryptocurrency is for the \u201cuse cases\u201d to be severely restricted while the underlying technology is used in safe, responsible contexts, for enterprise-blockchain era things like crowdsourcing and verification. Farmy, a cryptocurrency-based online grocery in Switzerland, is one initiative that Srenson finds particularly exciting. He exclaimed, Srenson is not the only person calling for greater caution in the cryptosphere. It feels like almost every new crypto product launch that is being offered right now is a response to FTX in some way. There are several press releases emphasizing regulations, guardrails, strict policies against gambling with billions of dollars in customer funds, and responsible \u201cwe would never do that\u201d pitches. Others are more trustworthy than others. the extensive Chinese exchange sent out one news release Huobi announces an ambitious plan to \u201chelp Huobi return to the top three exchanges in the world,\u201d noting puzzlingly that \u201ctechnology drives development and technology for good\u201d\u2014never mind that the project is led by one of cryptoland\u2019s least savory figures, \u201cHis Excellency and Plenipotentiary\u201d Justin Sun of the pointless TRON blockchain. Not just exchanges and firms close to exchanges are seeking a fresh start. The lunacy of November has enabled Alexandra Fanning, a publicist who has worked with crypto artists, to better pursue her goal of she said. On the other opposite end of the spectrum are those who think that FTX was, if anything, the result of excessive deference to conventional wisdom. Among them is Cindy Leow, the creator of the decentralized exchange Nexus, which, according to Leow, has witnessed a sharp increase in users since the meltdown. Leow stated, \u201cSo many people can\u2019t access their crypto anyplace else outside of Nexus.\u201d People are saying, \u201cI\u2019m logged out of Binance for some reason,\u201d and \u201cNexus is the only place I can trade,\u201d so I have to trade there. According to Leow, the crash is evidence that centralized, mainstream exchanges are still too young to be trusted with people\u2019s hard-earned life savings and that regulation will always only provide a thin layer of protection and respectability. She does, however, think that people ought to be able to experience that \u201cspeculative thrill without jeopardizing the security of their money. Users control their own keys, but Nexus \u201clooks and feels like a centralized exchange,\u201d according to the speaker. In this manner, it will be their own damn fault if and when they inevitably lose all of their money. And crypto benefits from that.",

    "content": "My flight from Los Angeles to New York took a little more than five hours, and I brought three suitcases full of my belongings with me.Pauline Villegas/Insider I moved from Los Angeles to New York City at 22 years old after graduating college. Since this was my first time relocating out of state, I learned a lot about how to pack for cross-country moves.\u00a0 I regret not packing simple money-savers like an umbrella, and I'm glad I brought my water bottle.\u00a0 At 22 years old, I moved from Los Angeles to New York by plane. The journey took nine hours, and I squeezed as many of my belongings as I could into three suitcases.After college, I moved from my hometown of Los Angeles to New York City.Pauline Villegas/InsiderThe summer after I graduated from the University of Southern California, I decided to move from my hometown of Los Angeles to New York City. I filled three suitcases and a carry-on with clothes, shoes, toiletries, and personal items.\u00a0Overall, I think I did a decent job packing for the move, but there are some things I would have done differently. Since this was my first out-of-state move, I had no idea what to expect and was shocked by how necessary some items proved to be.I learned a lot throughout the process, especially the importance of organized, thoughtful packing.Here are four items I regret leaving behind and four I'm glad I brought with me on my cross-country move from Los Angeles to New York.\u00a0\u00a0But there were some possessions I regret not bringing with me. I wish I had packed more decorative pieces, like posters and photos, to brighten up the stark white walls in my new apartment.The little artwork I did bring with me can't be hung up yet.Pauline Villegas/InsiderSince the space I had in my suitcases was limited, decorative pieces were the last thing on my mind while packing. I knew I'd ship some pieces from my Los Angeles apartment later, but I wish I had tried to fit some posters and decor items in my carry-on bag.\u00a0\u00a0When I got to New York, unpacking and settling in was a huge relief. But the move didn't have a satisfying end since my walls and furniture were bare for so long. The little decor I did bring couldn't be hung up immediately since I still had to buy more artwork and frames.If I could do it again, I would prioritize packing decorative pieces from my previous room in LA.I was also annoyed that I didn't bring my umbrella after being forced to buy one during one of New York's summer rains.My umbrella didn't make the cut by the time I packed the rest of my necessities.Pauline Villegas/InsiderWhile packing for the move, my umbrella was the last thing in my suitcase and the first thing I took out. After weighing my bags, I realized I had to shed a few items, and my umbrella didn't make the cut.\u00a0After I landed in New York in late August, a summer storm set in, and I was forced to purchase a $20 umbrella from my local Target.Since umbrellas don't take up too much space in a suitcase, I suggest bringing one on a cross-country move to avoid wasting money on a repurchase.In Los Angeles, I used foldable closet organizers from Ikea to make the most of my apartment's limited drawer space, but I regrettably forgot to bring them to New York.When I started unpacking, I realized I left my drawer and closet organizers back in Los Angeles.Pauline Villegas/InsiderI used containers and dividers from Ikea in my college dorm to organize my drawer space, and I kept most of those organizers all four years and stored them for safekeeping.\u00a0Since New York is known for its limited closet space, I purchased an Ikea bed with drawers. I'm thankful for the extra space, but I wish I had remembered to bring the drawer organizers I used in the past.\u00a0When I unpacked all my t-shirts, pants, and sweaters, I realized I didn't leave room for underclothes anywhere. I find closet organizers bring order to an otherwise stressful process, and they are something I'm going to repurchase soon.When I got to New York, I had to repurchase all the expensive hair products I could have brought from home, which cost me over $200.Repurchasing all my hair products ended up being a huge expense on top of normal moving costs.Pauline Villegas/InsiderI figured saving space in my checked baggage was essential for my cross-country move. But there are certain beauty products I wish I had packed in my suitcase for money-saving purposes.Having to buy all new hair products, along with other toiletries, was a much higher cost than I expected. Between Target and CVS, I spent over $200 buying all the new hair products and accessories I had left home.If I could do it again, I would have found space for these items in my checked baggage.\u00a0Though I left some essential items behind, I also appreciated some things I brought with me more than I expected. For instance, given New York's grime, I'm grateful I brought the house shoes I almost tossed.My old Birkenstocks ended up being the perfect house shoes for my NYC apartment.Pauline Villegas/InsiderBefore I left Los Angeles, I donated clothes and shoes to lighten the load. I almost got rid of my old Birkenstock sandals, but I decided to keep them for indoor wear at the last minute.After the move, I was so grateful to have house shoes to change into after long days of walking around New York. I learned quickly that the last thing you want to track into your apartment is the city's dirt and grime.I'm so glad I stuck my water bottle in my carry-on, especially since it was the only thing I had to drink out of when I moved into my apartment.Bringing my reusable water bottle on the plane gave me more time to find glassware I actually liked for my new place.Pauline Villegas/InsiderEven though I planned on buying all new glassware once I got to New York, packing my water bottle proved to be a game changer.When I travel, I like to bring a reusable water bottle, so fitting the bottle in my carry-on came as second nature while packing for the move.\u00a0When I arrived in NYC in August, it was hot and humid, so drinking water on the go was essential. Since my roommates and I had limited glassware in our first couple of weeks, my water bottle became a staple both inside and outside of my apartment.Fitting my tote bags in my suitcases was the right move since they became a convenient style necessity that I underestimated while packing.My tote bags and other purses are much easier to store than I expected.Pauline Villegas/InsiderRegarding packing my suitcase, bags like totes and fanny packs weren't a massive priority. But they didn't take up much room, so I tossed a couple in there.In the first weeks of my move, I realized how valuable a tote bag or fanny pack could be in a city like New York. I use these bags nearly every day to go shopping at the grocery store or carry things during a long walk. Apart from being functional, I also find them to be stylish.Though it may have gone against conventional wisdom and weighed down my carry-on, fitting my journals and books in my suitcase was worth the hassle.My journals and books eased the transition from my hometown to the Big Apple.Pauline Villegas/InsiderI was very selective while packing my carry-on bag because of its smaller size. But certain books and journals were nonnegotiable for me, no matter how much space they took up.\u00a0As an avid writer and note-taker, my journal proved to be a saving grace in the hustle and bustle of the big move. Taking time to journal and read throughout all the chaos was the best thing for my mental health, and I'm glad I was able to prioritize these items in the packing process.\u00a0I learned that, during a big move, it's just as essential to make space for the things that will bring you peace of mind as it is to save space \u2014 or maybe more.Read the original article on Insider",

    "description": "TIME recently spoke with XPO's billionaire chairman Brad Jacobs, about supply chains and why he's looking for his next takeover",
    "content": "(To receive weekly emails of conversations with the world\u2019s top CEOs and business decisionmakers, click here.) Serial deal maker Brad Jacobs looks forward to a looming U.S. recession while he hunts for another takeover. \u201cIt\u2019s a good time to do my next big thing,\u2019\u2019 the 66-year-old billionaire explains. \u201cA downturn creates buying opportunities for acquirers with capital like me.\u201d Jacobs has done more than 500 takeovers during his long career, typically by swallowing smaller players in fragmented markets. He stepped down this fall as chief executive of XPO Logistics, the transportation giant he built through aggressive acquisitions and organic growth. [time-brightcove not-tgx=\u201dtrue\u201d] He remains executive chairman of the Greenwich, Conn., company, focused on its less-than-truckload freight operation following the Nov. 1 spinoff of XPO\u2019s freight brokerage into a separate, publicly traded entity called RXO. The executive says he can now spend most of his time pursuing a fresh target\u2014perhaps a financial services, healthcare, homebuilding, or special-purpose acquisition company. (SPACs buy businesses and effectively take them public.) Jacobs also founded or co-founded four companies in the oil, waste disposal, and equipment-rental industries. Each grew into enterprises with at least $1 billion in annual revenue. In 2011, the entrepreneur gained majority control of Express-1 Expedited Solutions, a freight-services provider with a market value of about $72 million that he renamed XPO Logistics. Its market capitalization peaked at $16.8 billion a decade later. Jacobs, a math and music major at Bennington College and Brown University, never completed his degree. Music offered the trained classical pianist lessons relevant to business, such as \u201cwhen to go fast and when to go slow,\u201d he adds. TIME recently spoke with Jacobs, about possibly reinventing himself via a $30-billion company, cures for clogged supply chains, and integrating takeovers successfully. The interview has been condensed and edited for clarity. How soon will another recession hit America and how badly might it hurt XPO? It is a near certainty that we\u2019re going to go into a recession over the next few quarters. It could be deeper than people might be expecting. But I am optimistic it won\u2019t last long. A downturn is a negative thing for the transportation industry because growth of a transportation company in part depends on the flow of goods. We continue to invest in our business regardless of where we are in the economic cycle to be well-positioned when economic activity starts to pick up again. Our biggest secret is proprietary technology, which has been a big part of our growth. [It] is of immense value during a healthy economy and a not so healthy economy. That allows us to grab market share profitably. You reinvent yourself every decade or so. But you\u2019re now 66. Will your next reinvention be your last hurrah before retirement? I doubt that. I was born to be a CEO. The job matches my skill set just perfectly and gives me a lot of satisfaction apart from the money. I\u2019m going to do my very best to be as busy as possible until the day I die. For the most part, it\u2019s going to be as a CEO. Yet you aren\u2019t CEO of anything today. Maybe that\u2019s why you\u2019re eager to do another deal soon. Why are falling SPACs on your shopping list? I\u2019m looking at dozens of SPACs that were $10 a share and are now a fraction of that. I\u2019m not interested in most of them because I don\u2019t see where significant growth is going to come from. Scalability is the most important thing I look for when I get into an industry. For me, growing a company dramatically is a prerequisite to creating tremendous shareholder value. But with my extra billion dollars on their balance sheet and me as their dynamic new CEO, I could see some of those SPAC companies becoming very big companies. Might you instead acquire a very big company with spectacular growth potential? That\u2019s harder to do when you\u2019re already big, but not impossible. M&A is a lot like having kids. It\u2019s very hard to plan exactly. You have to be patient and disciplined. I\u2019m in a hurry to do the right deal, something that I\u2019m confident will create tons of money for my shareholders. But I\u2019m not in a hurry to do the wrong deal. My next acquisition could be something that\u2019s only a couple hundred million dollars in revenue. Or it could be something that has $30 billion of revenue. I would devise a business plan to grow its profitability. I don\u2019t necessarily have to buy 100% of a company. I could invest a billion or billion and a half dollars so I have a significant shareholder stake and then become CEO. During the recent supply-chain crisis, XPO helped unsnarl bottlenecks for customers in several industries. What moves are you making that will benefit your customers when the supply chain clogs again? We\u2019re doing many things that should have tremendous positive effects for years. We\u2019re now spending significant [amounts] getting more trucks. We nearly tripled our production of trailers. Our driver training schools will probably graduate twice as many new drivers this year than last year. All these things primarily create more capacity. We\u2019re able to process more freight for customers, and that helps unsnarl customer supply chains. Between 70% and 90% of acquisitions fail, often due to poor integration. What\u2019s the most important step you took to successfully integrate 500-plus acquired businesses? I respected the people who came with the acquisitions. The single biggest mistake that acquirers make after buying a company is that on day one, they think they have all the answers. Guess what? They don\u2019t. [Employees] feel disrespected, and many leave. It\u2019s foolish to think you\u2019ve got all the answers before you\u2019ve asked the people actually running the business every day what makes this company great and what\u2019s holding the company back that should be done differently. In the early days of an acquisition, we use our ears and eyes a lot more than our mouths.We want to unleash great ideas that team members have had that never got their day in the sun. We solicit very valuable input from people on the front line and at all levels of management. You create a culture where people realize they are rewarded to speak up and say not just good things, but also difficult things in a respectful way. People feel empowered. We get an avalanche of extremely valuable insights that we almost always use to modify the business plan we had based our purchase on. Mario Harik, your successor as XPO\u2019s chief, was among your first hires there, and you undoubtedly groomed him to assume command. How should other companies better prepare internal contenders for the corner office especially when its present occupant wears huge shoes? Create a deep bench of executives whom you expose to all the key things going on in the company, even if it\u2019s not their direct responsibilities. The several dozen top executives learn about all different aspects of running a company, so they understand other senior executives\u2019 techniques and practices. It becomes an in-house education. [That\u2019s] the way we ran XPO over the last decade. I never siloed executives, like you see in most companies. We created a big bench of CEO candidates. Look at Drew Wilkerson, now CEO of RXO. He benefited tremendously from seeing how other leaders were managing their businesses inside the company. How will you avoid micromanaging Mario while serving as XPO\u2019s executive chairman? Mario does not need any micromanaging. He\u2019s much smarter than I am. In terms of mentoring, I will continue to be part boss but largely his colleague, peer, and sounding board. I [also] serve as kind of a therapist, counselor, advisor, and friend. I\u2019m not going to be intruding more than I should. I will let him be the CEO. What special skills do young people need these days to succeed in business if they imitate your example and lack a college degree? Education is important for someone coming into the workforce who has ambitious career plans. Do they have to get a degree? Not necessarily. But they have to cultivate an attitude of wanting to be a lifelong learner. You also need to learn to write. You\u2019re not likely to become a CEO of a multibillion-dollar company if you have poor grammar. And generally speaking, you have to work your tail off to be very successful in business. Years ago, you wanted to call your garbage business Jacobs Waste Systems. But your father disliked that idea and so you named it United Waste Systems instead. Will you put your surname on the next business that you buy and grow? For me, business has never been about ego. It\u2019s about making money for shareholders. If putting my name as part of the company name helps with creating shareholder value, I\u2019m more than happy to do it. I\u2019m big on accountability. People should dream big, set big goals, be very specific [about] the milestones, and then be visible in holding yourself and your team members accountable for progress you\u2019re making. When you put your name on a company, it says, \u201cI take responsibility for everything that happens in this company.\u201d It shows the reputation and fortune of the company [are] as important as your own personal reputation, fortune, and success.",

    "content": "EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. \u2014 On a dreary afternoon, after the Chicago Bears\u2019 fifth consecutive loss, the vibe inside the visiting locker room at MetLife Stadium felt predictably glum. For starters, a 31-10 pummeling by the New York Jets triggered a different kind of disappointment within a last-place team that had lost eight times before Sunday. \u201cI thought we got our asses kicked, honestly,\u201d tight end Cole Kmet said. Advertisement But there was much more to this latest dejection: the anguish that comes with watching team leaders fall by the wayside. Safety Eddie Jackson hobbled out of the locker room with a walking boot on his left foot. He was hurt in the second quarter, his foot giving out as he tried to cut on what turned out to be a 54-yard Jets touchdown pass. Almost immediately, Jackson\u2019s absence was felt. Advertisement \u201cHe\u2019s a (bleeping) leader, bro,\u201d defensive tackle Justin Jones said. \u201cHe\u2019s a hell of a player. I hope he\u2019s OK and I hope he can come back soon. Because we need him on defense. We really do.\u201d Added linebacker Nicholas Morrow: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to replace a guy like that.\u201d [ [Don't miss] Week 12 recap: Starting QB confusion and injuries mark Chicago Bears\u2019 31-10 loss to New York Jets ] In the third quarter, receiver Darnell Mooney exited with a left ankle injury, his day ending when Jets safety Jordan Whitehead landed on the back of his leg as Mooney engaged in a block during a David Montgomery run. Mooney couldn\u2019t put an ounce of weight on his leg as he was assisted to the locker room. His exit also hit teammates hard. \u201cIt stinks,\u201d quarterback Trevor Siemian said. \u201cAs a player, (losing him) is terrible. But if you\u2019ve spent any time with Darnell, he\u2019s one of the best dudes in our locker room. That\u2019s the part of the game that stinks.\u201d Added Kmet: \u201cYou hate to see a guy like Moon go down. He\u2019s just a bright, vibrant guy in the huddle and obviously a big playmaker. When you lose him, it\u2019s tough for sure.\u201d Bears wide receiver Darnell Mooney (11) leaves with an injury in the third quarter Sunday, Nov. 27, 2022, at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J. (Brian Cassella / Chicago Tribune) From the look of things, it would be stunning if either Jackson or Mooney is available for next Sunday\u2019s game against the Green Bay Packers at Soldier Field. Until more is known about the specifics of either injury, the prospect of one or both players landing on injured reserve can\u2019t be ruled out. \u201cWhen you lose the production of those guys, number one, that always hurts,\u201d coach Matt Eberflus said. \u201cBut then also it\u2019s the leadership part. Those guys have been great in the locker room. They\u2019re great teammates.\u201d Advertisement For the Bears, Sunday will go into the books as one of the worst days in a rough season. In addition to the injuries to Jackson and Mooney, right tackle Riley Reiff left with a shoulder issue and his replacement, Larry Borom, also was unable to finish because of an injury the team didn\u2019t disclose. Reserve safety Dane Cruikshank suffered a hamstring injury. Rookie defensive backfield starters Kyler Gordon and Jaquan Brisker were inactive because of concussions suffered a week earlier in Atlanta. So, yes, the Bears were significantly short-handed in their attempt to sidestep a winless November. About the only good to come out of Sunday was the team\u2019s decision to keep starting quarterback Justin Fields inactive with a separated left shoulder. Fields, who wasn\u2019t formally ruled out until 90 minutes before kickoff, never gained clearance to play from the Bears medical staff. Even after that call was made and Siemian got the green light to start, he, too, had his own hard luck, straining an oblique muscle during pregame warmups. Yep, you read that correctly. The backup quarterback strained an oblique \u2014 in warmups. That triggered the Bears to announce that Nathan Peterman would start. Until Siemian received some pain-relieving aid, fought through his discomfort and got clearance to play less than 15 minutes before kickoff. Advertisement \u201cHonestly, I\u2019m more embarrassed,\u201d Siemian said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a room full of guys in there playing in Week 12, going through hell, and I have a non-contact thing show up. Yeah, not ideal.\u201d As for Sunday\u2019s game, the Bears\u2019 fifth consecutive loss was their most lopsided this season, both in margin of defeat and competitive fight shown. Jets quarterback Mike White, making his first start of the year, threw for 315 yards with three touchdown passes and a 149.3 passer rating. At times he looked like Aaron Rodgers, operating calmly from the pocket, finding completions, then mixing in a flurry of timely big plays. Jets quarterback Mike White (5) celebrates a touchdown pass in the third quarter Sunday, Nov. 27, 2022, at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J. (Brian Cassella / Chicago Tribune) Garrett Wilson (five catches, 95 yards) caught two of White\u2019s touchdown passes, the first after breaking free from a hold by Bears cornerback Kindle Vildor. The Jets also got a 32-yard touchdown run from backup running back Ty Johnson that came with at least three Bears defenders \u2014 linebacker Jack Sanborn and safeties DeAndre Houston-Carson and Elijah Hicks \u2014 failing to finish fairly routine tackle attempts. The Jets averaged 7.5 yards per play as the Bears defense failed to come up with a takeaway while producing only one sack. \u201cI know we probably had a lot of guys playing who were surprised to be in there,\u201d Jones said. \u201cBut we have to make sure those guys are ready.\u201d Advertisement Without Fields, meanwhile, the Bears offense lacked any significant pop. They scored 10 points on their first two possessions, then went scoreless for the final 44 minutes, 20 seconds. [ [Don't miss] How concerning is Justin Fields\u2019 left shoulder injury? How has Luke Getsy performed as OC? 4 questions facing the Chicago Bears. ] The offense\u2019s 292 total yards marked the fifth time this season that unit failed to reach 300. Over the final three quarters, the Bears managed only 156 yards and eight first downs. Eberflus couldn\u2019t even lean on his team\u2019s competitive tenacity as a bright spot. \u201cNo excuses, no explanations,\u201d he said. \u201cIt just wasn\u2019t good enough. I told the guys in the locker room, \u2018We\u2019re better than that.\u2019\u201d Right now, though, the 3-9 Bears aren\u2019t better than many teams. The only team with fewer wins is the 1-9-1 Houston Texans. Still, five games remain. And with the losses and injuries piling up, the Bears have to find extra reserves to retain their focus and commitment through the finish line. Advertisement \u201cIt comes down to the individual,\u201d Eberflus said. \u201cWe have men of character in that locker room. They\u2019ve been battling the whole way. And we\u2019re going to continue to rely on that for sure. And then it comes down to daily practice and daily habits. What are you doing every single day to get better?\u201d At this point, the Bears\u2019 \u201cget better\u201d demands include a worrisome list of notable players working to recover from significant injuries.",

The recent Glassnode data shows that the average retail investor likely remains bullish on crypto, with smaller holders stacking it up. Bitcoin has been battered by the unfavorable macro environment as well as the downfalls of such major players as Terra and FTX.

    "content": "Market analyst Benjamin Cowen speculates that a Bitcoin price bottom could be reached in December. Market watchers have been having mixed expectations for when the BTC bear market will end. Market analysts continue to speculate that the price of Bitcoin may have not reached a bottom at its current price. Crypto analyst Benjamin Cowen is among such commentators who expect the market to mimic other bear market cycles, particularly the capitulation scenario of 2018. In a new analysis, Cowen opined that it would not be unreasonable to expect a bottoming scenario similar to that of 2018 in which BTC made a series of slightly higher lows before sharply capitulating to new lows to reach its price bottom. Cowen extrapolated historical data from the 200-day moving average technical indicator to support his argument. According to him, the current market could see a potential capitulation event to mark the bottom around the Christmas holiday of this year. At this point, BTC could be poised for a bull run. He added; We could sort of extrapolate out the 200-day simple moving average if it were to continue on down on its current trajectory, where might it cross?\u2026 You could see that it would cross somewhere in late December, right around Christmas, December 25th, December 26th, December 27th, around the holidays is where it would cross, While conceding that the analysis is just speculation, he further noted that bear cycles in the Bitcoin market have historically lasted an average of one year. The current bear market has been going on for over a year and therefore may soon come to an end, he said, adding the disclaimer that investors should not spend too much energy trying to call the bottom. So far in 2022 making the case for the bottom has not really served anyone well, and that\u2019s why at the beginning of the year we said, \u2018Look, don\u2019t spend too much mental energy trying to call a bottom in 2022\u2019 Could the price of BTC continue to crash? Previously, Cowen told his over 770k subscribers to watch out for the crossing of the Bitcoin percentage of supply in profit and the Bitcoin 30-day moving average metrics as the occurrence could mark the market bottom as it has done in other bear markets. While this cross has yet to materialize, analysts and market participants are expecting the price of Bitcoin to fall further than even the two-year low price of around $15,600 it reached last week. According to a Wall Street Journal (WSJ) report, Jake Wujastyk, VP at TrendSpider LLC, has speculated that the Bitcoin market had formed a clear \u201cbear flag\u201d and would inevitably drop to new lows or potentially drop to zero. In contrast, Galaxy Digital\u2019s Mike Novogratz recently asserted that crypto is not going anywhere and will recover to new highs. BTC is trading at around $16,200, down 2.07 percent in the last 24 hours at the time of writing.

You get a different amount of power based on the device, the port, the battery level, and whatever else is drawing current. It can make you wish for a few ports that power whatever you plug in, whatever the size. You used to need a big surge protector, packed with charging bricks crowding each other out, to get that kind of juice. But these days, gallium nitride-based chargers can put out serious power from a small space. We've scanned the marketplace, tried out a few of them, and have some recommendations for different power needs.

    "content": "The crypto market is currently under selling pressure as the majority of crypto assets were posting significant losses at the time of writing. SHIB , however, has managed to cushion the selling effect slightly as it posts lesser losses in comparison to other major cryptocurrencies.

For context, cryptocurrencies such as Dogecoin and Huobi Token were posting losses of 10% and 14%, respectively. Despite the drop in price across the board, SHIB is demonstrating gains of 83% in its trading volume.

    "content": "In a recent tweet, Musk shared a slide of a discussion in one of the company\u2019s talks in which \u201cTwitter 2.0\u201d was unveiled. In the past week, Dogecoin has surged by 24 percent owing largely to developments around Twitter. The world\u2019s richest man Elon Musk recently completed a $44 billion deal to take over Twitter on October 27, 2022. His takeover has been good news to free speech advocates with the Dogecoin community also expecting something positive with his long-standing interest in the ecosystem. In a recent tweet, Musk shared a slide of a discussion in one of the company\u2019s talks in which \u201cTwitter 2.0\u201d was unveiled. This is officially branded as \u201cThe Everything App\u201d. Even though not much information was disclosed about this development, Musk revealed that there could be new features including long-form tweets, the relaunch of blue-verified payments, and encrypted DMs. However, the silence on the payment option has left the community in anticipation. With his interest in crypto and based on his previous tweets, it is expected that Dogecoin would be integrated into Twitter 2.0. In the past week, Dogecoin has surged by 24 percent as investors react positively to the Twitter 2.0 development. Its trading volume is $1,983,041,808.96, an 83 percent surge in the last 24 hours according to market data. Elon Musk previously said that Dogecoin is the real currency in an interview with the media. The point is that Dogecoin was invented as a joke, essentially to make fun of cryptocurrency. Fate loves irony. What would be the most ironic outcome? The currency that started as a joke becomes the real currency. To the moon! Dogecoin to become the crypto of Twitter? In an interview with Time Magazine, Musk disclosed that he would consider Dogecoin as a transactional currency rather than Bitcoin. His reason was primarily due to the transaction flow of both currencies. At least at a space level, it is suitable as a store of value. But fundamentally, Bitcoin is not a good substitute for transactional currency. The total transaction flow that you do with Dogecoin in transactions per day has a much higher potential than Bitcoin. In April, Musk disclosed the idea of adding Dogecoin as a payment method for the Twitter subscription service, Blue, triggering a price surge. Jane Manchun Wong, a popular tech blogger also mentioned that Twitter was working on a wallet prototype that would support crypto deposit and withdrawal. However, the type of crypto or the network is completely unknown. Avi Felman, head of trading at BlockTower Capital believes that most investors purchase the meme coin because they think it should have value. According to him, Musk is only pushing the message of \u201cwhy can\u2019t Doge have value?\u201d This is because people like these kinds of messages. Dogecoin becoming the crypto of Twitter is just a matter of time.

    "description": "The meme coin\u2019s latest bull run may be related to the speculation that it could be involved in Elon Musk\u2019s plans for Twitter.",
    "content": "Dogecoin has shot up over 22.5% in the past week, jumping from $0.075 to $0.094, according to CoinGecko . The rapid price increase may follow speculation that the leading meme coin will be included in potential plans for Twitter to incorporate payments , which according to a transcript originally reported by Vox , would also incorporate crypto payments. Though unconfirmed as of yet, some have speculated that a move by the new owner to incorporate financial services into Twitter could also see Musk\u2019s preferred cryptocurrency become involved in some way. In a Sunday tweet, Musk shared slides from an internal Twitter presentation. Unpacking \"Twitter 2.0,\" he outlined several potential changes, including encrypted DMs and long-form tweets. The presentation also includes a blank space next to payments, leading some to speculate that a cryptocurrency may be used. The latest rally now places Dogecoin eighth in the ranking of the largest cryptocurrencies by market cap. At roughly $13 billion , the cryptocurrency is larger than Polygon, Cardano, Litecoin, and Solana. Dogecoin was created in 2013 by IBM software engineer Billy Markus and Adobe engineer Jackson Palmer, reportedly to mock coins such as Bitcoin with lofty plans of taking over the world. Since then, its ebbs and flows have been strongly connected to statements made by the billionaire. The meme coin\u2019s initial bull run began in January 2021, when Musk first started making statements about the coin on Twitter. The currency rocketed up 57% in just 24 hours on February 4, 2021, following the Tesla chief posting a photoshopped image from the popular Disney film The Lion King with him holding up Dogecoin\u2019s Shibu Inu canine logo. Musk-related volatility has historically also pushed Dogecoin down, as well as up. In May 2021, when he appeared on Saturday Night Live and appeared to mock the coin, it lost around 30% of its value in the immediate aftermath. Aside from Musk-related speculation, the news comes as the technical foundations of the meme coin may soon begin undergoing serious improvements. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin confirmed in February this year that he would work with Dogecoin Foundation so that the coin could undergo a transition to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) from its current Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism.

Interest is typically expressed as a percentage of the amount of money that has been borrowed, and it is typically paid on a regular basis (such as monthly or yearly).",
    "content": "When it comes to finances, the term \u201cinterest\u201d refers to the amount of money that is paid by a borrower to a lender in order to use the money that has been lent. Interest is typically expressed as a percentage of the amount of money that has been borrowed, and it is typically paid on a regular basis (such as monthly or yearly). When it comes to crypto assets, interest can be generated in a number of ways. For example, some crypto assets pay interest to holders on a regular basis, much like a traditional savings account. In other words, crypto dividends. As a result, flexibility is limited. Other crypto assets may offer interest-bearing products, such as loans or credit products, that allow users to earn interest on their deposited funds. The practice is known as crypto lending and is considered highly risky. Still, others may offer staking rewards to users who lock up their assets for a set period of time. Staking a coin requires trusting the coin, network, and team. Last but not least, crypto trading can be automated. A number of companies automate the crypto trading process and invest for the benefit of their users. As part of their continuous reporting, automated crypto trading companies like Haru Invest release their recent performance numbers. They even allows you to calculate future earnings. Regardless of the method, earning interest on crypto assets can be a great way to boost one\u2019s returns. Why earning interest on your crypto holdings can be a good idea? Many people who invest in cryptocurrencies do so with the expectation of earning a return on their investment. One way to earn a return on your crypto holdings is to earn interest on them. There are a few reasons why this can be a good idea. First, it can help you to grow your holdings without having to put any additional money into them. This can compound over time , leading to significant growth. Second, it can provide you with a steady stream of income that can help offset any losses that you may incur. Finally, it can help to diversify your portfolio and reduce your overall risk. For these reasons, earning interest on your crypto holdings can be a smart move. What are the benefits of compound interest over time? Compound interest is often described as the \u2018eighth wonder of the world\u2019, and for good reason. It is a powerful force that can work wonders for anyone who saves regularly, whether for retirement, a rainy day fund, or some other purpose. Unlike simple interest, which is calculated on the original principal only, compound interest is calculated on the principal plus any accrued interest. This means that the longer money is left to grow, the more rapidly it will grow. For example, if someone deposits $100 into a savings account with an annual interest rate of 5%, they will have $105 at the end of the first year. In the second year, they will earn interest on the $105, rather than just on the original $100. Image source: https://www.ncl.ac.uk/webtemplate/ask-assets/external/maths-resources/finance/simple-and-compound-interest.html As a result, their balance will grow even faster, and compound interest will really start to work its magic as time goes on. Over time, even small amounts of money can grow to large sums through compound interest. This makes it an extremely powerful tool for anyone who wants to build long-term wealth. \u200b David Bold David is a crypto enthusiast and an expert in personal finance.

    "content": "The final round of the group stage of the World Cup brings with it a multitude of possibilities for each team to advance in the tournament. This year\u2019s tournament in particular\u2014which has already seen thrilling last-minute goals, stunning comebacks, and shock defeats of favorites\u2014is anything but predictable. And with so many ways it can play out, every kick over the next four days will matter. The group stage in its current form actually makes up most of the World Cup, comprising 48 of the 64 games. Within each group of four teams, it\u2019s a round-robin-style competition to finish in the top two spots based on points: three points are earned for a win, one for a draw, and zero for a loss. The bottom two teams from each of the eight groups are eliminated from the tournament. [time-brightcove not-tgx=\u201dtrue\u201d] And while finishing first or second ensures a team moves on to the Round of 16, the specific order in which they advance is important, too. The winner of Group A plays the runner-up of Group B, the runner-up of A plays the winner of B, and so on for Groups C and D, E and F, and G and H. There\u2019s something special about the final round. As of Monday evening, each team in all eight groups has faced off against two other teams in their group and has one remaining game to accumulate any more points. The stakes are raised for these third matchups, as every team knows it\u2019s their last chance to do what they need to do to stay in the tournament. And unlike in the first two rounds, the final two matches for each group are played simultaneously, making it a nerve-wracking 90 minutes for all teams involved\u2014and for the fans who are trying to monitor every potential outcome. Read More: Team USA\u2019s World Cup Fate Is in Their Own Hands Following Tie With England Often teams in a group finish with the same number of points, but unlike in the knockout stage, there are no penalty shootouts. In the event of a tie on points in the group stage, places are determined by a series of tiebreakers. First, total goal difference (all of the team\u2019s goals scored across their three matches minus all of their goals conceded). If still tied, just the number of goals scored are considered. If still tied, the teams\u2019 head-to-head results determine which finishes ahead of the other. FIFA introduced a fourth \u201cfair play\u201d tiebreaker during the last World Cup. According to FIFA\u2019s website, \u201cthe team that has accumulated the fewest indiscipline points wins (a yellow card equals 1 point, a red card shown for two yellows equals 3 points, a direct red card equals 4 points and a direct red card shown to a player who was already on a yellow equals 5 points).\u201d If somehow teams were still tied, which finishes ahead of the other would theoretically be determined by a drawing of lots, though no team has ever been eliminated from a World Cup that way. Here\u2019s a guide to all the different potential outcomes this week, listed in order of most likely to least likely, based on a model by American data analysis website FiveThirtyEight. But with so many upsets thus far in the competition, don\u2019t count out the underdogs. Group A In Group A, World Cup host nation Qatar (currently with 0 points) has no chance of advancing to the knockout stage of the competition, while group leader Netherlands (4 points) is very likely to advance. Ecuador (4 points) will stay in the competition with a draw or a win against Senegal, while Senegal (3 points) needs to beat Ecuador to move on to the next round. The matches kick off at 10 a.m. Eastern time on Tuesday, November 29. Ayman Aref\u2014NurPhoto/Getty ImagesFans of the Qatar national team during the World Cup the opening match between the host nation and Ecuador at Al Bayt Stadium on Nov. 20, 2022. [28.86%] Netherlands beats Qatar, Ecuador beats Senegal: Both Netherlands (7 points) and Ecuador (7 points) advance, with the order determined by which team wins by more goals in their final match. If they both win by the same margin, whichever team scores more goals in their final match finishes first in the group. If they both win by the same score, the next applicable tiebreaker (since they drew head-to-head) is \u201cfair play.\u201d Netherlands goes into the final match slightly leading on that metric, having received only two yellow cards in previous matches, compared to Ecuador\u2019s three yellow cards. If still tied, the order is determined by a drawing of lots. [25.74%] Netherlands beats Qatar, Ecuador draws Senegal: Netherlands (7 points) win the group. Ecuador (5 points) advances as runner-up.

[2.31%] Qatar beats Netherlands, Ecuador draws Senegal: Ecuador (5 points) wins the group, and either Netherlands (4 points) or Senegal (4 points) advances as runner-up. If Netherlands loses to Qatar by one goal, Netherlands advances based on goal difference. If Netherlands loses to Qatar by two goals, whichever of Senegal or Netherlands scores more goals in their final match advances; if they score the same number of goals in their final match, Netherlands advances based on having previously beaten Senegal head-to-head. If Netherlands loses to Qatar by three goals or more, Senegal advances based on goal difference. [2.1%] Qatar beats Netherlands, Senegal beats Ecuador: Senegal (6 points) wins the group, and whichever of Netherlands (4 points) or Ecuador (4 points) loses by fewer goals advances as runner-up. If Netherlands and Ecuador lose by the same number of goals, whichever team scores more goals in their final match advances. If they both lose their final match by the same score, the next applicable tiebreaker (since they drew head-to-head) is \u201cfair play.\u201d Netherlands goes into the final match slightly leading on that metric, having received only two yellow cards in previous matches, compared to Ecuador\u2019s three yellow cards. If still tied, the team that advances is determined by a drawing of lots. Group B Group B leader England (currently with 4 points) is in a good position to advance, barring a big loss to Wales. Team USA (2 points) and Iran (3 points), meanwhile, are in a winner-takes-all battle. And Wales (1 point) needs to win against England to have a chance. The matches kick off at 2 p.m. Eastern time on Tuesday, November 29.

[9.88%] Wales and England draw, USA beats Iran: Both England (5 points) and the United States (5 points) advance. England will be the winner of the group unless Team USA beats Iran by four goals or more. If the U.S. beats Iran by five goals or more, the U.S. advances as the group winner. If the U.S. beats Iran by four goals, the next tiebreaker will be goals scored, which England leads the U.S. by four going into the final matches. If they remain tied, the next applicable tiebreaker (since they drew head-to-head) is \u201cfair play.\u201d England goes into the final match leading on that metric, having received zero yellow cards in previous matches, compared to the four yellow cards the U.S. has received. If still tied, the order is determined by a drawing of lots. [8.06%] Wales and England draw, Iran beats USA: Iran (6 points) wins the group. England (5 points) advances as runner-up.

If Wales beats England by 7 goals or more, Wales wins the group, and Iran advances as runner-up. If Wales beats England by six goals, Wales wins the group, and either Iran or England advances as runner-up based on goals scored, which England leads Iran by two going into the final matches. If still tied (i.e. Wales beats England 6-0, Iran draws USA 2-2), England advances because it beat Iran when the two teams met head-to-head last week. Group C Saudi Arabia shook up Group C last week with its shock defeat of tournament favorites Argentina. Poland (currently with 4 points) now tops the group and only needs a draw to advance. Saudi Arabia (3 points) advances with a win against Mexico, and Argentina (3 points) advances with a win against Poland. At the bottom of the table, Mexico (1 point), a team that has yet to score a goal in this tournament, needs to beat Saudi Arabia to have any hope of advancing. The matches kick off at 2 p.m. Eastern time on Wednesday, November 30. Jabin Botsford\u2014The Washington Post/Getty ImagesSaudi Arabia fans celebrate after a goal by midfielder Salem Al-Dawsari against Argentina at Lusail Stadium on Nov. 22, 2022.

If still tied, the team that advances is determined by a drawing of lots. [17.98%] Argentina beats Poland, Saudi Arabia and Mexico draw: Argentina (6 points) wins the group, and either Poland (4 points) or Saudi Arabia (4 points) advances as runner-up. Poland advances if it loses to Argentina by two goals or fewer; Saudi Arabia advances if Poland loses to Argentina by four goals or more. If Poland loses to Argentina by three goals, either Poland or Saudi Arabia advances based on whichever team scores more goals in their final match; if they score the same number of goals, Poland advances because it beat Saudi Arabia head-to-head.

Group D In Group D, reigning World Cup champion France (currently with 6 points) has already guaranteed its advancement to the knockout stage. Australia (3 points) advances with a win or a draw against Denmark, and Denmark (1 point) advances if it beats Australia. Tunisia (1 point) needs to beat France to have a chance at advancing, though it would still depend on the outcome of the game between Australia and Denmark.

Now every team still has a chance to qualify for the knockout stage. Spain (currently with 4 points) is guaranteed to advance if they draw or win against Japan. Japan (3 points) will advance with a win against Spain, and Costa Rica (3 points) will advance with a win against Germany. It\u2019s not entirely in the Germans\u2019 hands, as Germany (1 point) needs to beat Costa Rica and it needs Japan not to win against Spain in order to advance.

If still tied (i.e. Costa Rica beats Germany 7-0, Japan beats Spain 6-5), Costa Rica wins the group based on having previously beaten Japan head-to-head. Group F In Group F, underdog Morocco (currently with 4 points) is now favorite to advance, with a win or a draw against Canada guaranteeing a spot in the Round of 16 and even a loss not ruling them out. Last World Cup\u2019s finalist Croatia (4 points) will advance with a win or a draw, while FIFA\u2019s No. 2-ranked team in the world Belgium (3 points) needs to beat Croatia to advance.

Group G Like France, World Cup favorite Brazil (currently with 6 points) has already secured a spot in the Round of 16, and it\u2019s almost certainly set to top Group G. Switzerland (3 points) will advance with a win, while Cameroon (1 point) and Serbia (1 point) each need to win to have a chance at advancing, but even then it\u2019s not guaranteed and would be dependent on the result of the other match.

If still tied (i.e. South Korea beats Portugal 3-1, Ghana beats Uruguay 1-0), Portugal wins the group based on having previously beaten Ghana head-to-head.",

    "content": "SPOKANE, Wash. \u2014 As we head into the holiday season, a time of giving gifts of all kinds \u2014 electronic toys, tools and gadgets \u2014 the Spokane Fire Department is educating us on the risks that come with the newest innovations. You\u2019ve probably seen videos online (like this one) of phones and other electronic devices combusting. Those explosions are the results of thermal runaway, a chemical reaction that happens when the temperature within a battery (like the one in your cell phone) exceeds a certain point. Essentially, the heat generated is greater than the heat dispersed, and it sparks a chemical reaction and oftentimes, a fire. \u201cThrough every new invention and every new innovation that comes into society, there is always a period of time where public safety has to adapt to the new reality,\u201d Spokane Fire Chief Brian Schaeffer said. \u201cThe new risk that innovation brings to society.\u201d Right now, that newer innovation is lithium-ion batteries, and we\u2019re still very much learning about the safety and health risks these products present. Meanwhile, we use them in just about every facet of our life. In October, SFD hosted a national seminar that focused on fires started by these batteries. They brought leaders and scientists together from all over the country in hopes of better understanding the dangers that come from fires involving lithium-ion batteries. \u201cWe know what is in that off-gasoline material,\u201d Schaeffer said. \u201cIt\u2019s volatile, it\u2019s carcinogenic, and many of those chemicals once they enter your body, they never leave.\u201d As a result, it\u2019s the firefighters who bear the brunt of this when they\u2019re protecting our community, by putting out these types of fires. So where do we see these batteries? \u201cThings like toys that run on rechargeable batteries, kitchen devices that run on lithium-ion batteries,\u201d Schaeffer said. \u201cEssentially any type of electronic device that you would use in a cordless fashion, there is a high likelihood it\u2019s a lithium-ion battery. All lithium-ion batteries will have an indicator on the underside of it that shows, \u2018Li-ion.'\u201d How do we use them safely? Charge the batteries only when you\u2019re home and present, and within an area without combustibles. When the devices are fully charged, get them off the charger to prevent over-charging. If you have a lithium-ion battery that\u2019s been damaged, take it to the Waste to Energy Plant in Spokane, so they can dispose of it properly.

    "content": "Fidelity has launched its Fidelity Crypto product according to a report. The move is the latest bullish crypto development being pioneered by the $4.5 trillion asset manager. Financial services giant Fidelity has launched its retail cryptocurrency trading product called \u2018Fidelity Crypto\u2019 to allow users to trade Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH). According to reporting by the Block, Fidelity has been sending emails to some users saying \u201cthe wait is over.\u201d Users who signed up for the product were notified that a Fidelity brokerage account that maintains a minimum balance of $1 was needed to be able to fund a new Fidelity Crypto account. The product allows for commission-free trading of the two leading cryptocurrencies. However, Fidelity says a spread of 1 percent will be factored into every trade execution price. The product also allows Fidelity\u2019s clients the use of custodial and trading services provided by its subsidiary Fidelity Digital Assets, as well as get access to crypto educational materials. The launch of the product is coming after Fidelity opened a waitlist earlier this month for interested clients to join. At the time, Fidelity, which has over $4.5 trillion worth of assets under management (AUM), said that it has noted high interest in crypto trading from its clients hence the launch of the product. Fidelity told CNBC in a statement; Where our customers invest matters more than ever. A meaningful portion of Fidelity customers are already interested in and own crypto. We are providing them with tools to support their choice, so they can benefit from Fidelity\u2019s education, research, and technology, Meanwhile, the launch is not the financial services company\u2019s first foray into the crypto market. Fidelity states on its website that it has been mining Bitcoin since 2014. Fidelity also has a lineup of crypto-related exchange-traded funds (ETF) including the Fidelity Advantage Bitcoin ETF launched last year in Canada, as well as the Fidelity Crypto Industry and Digital Payments ETF (FDIG). Fidelity\u2019s attempts to launch a BTC spot-settled in the U.S. has been repeatedly rebuffed by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) while its plan to include Bitcoin in its retirement savings plans has been getting pushback from members of Congress. Institutional adoption all round bullish for BTC and crypto Despite the regulatory uncertainty, more traditional financial giants have been showing interest in the cryptocurrency industry. Like Fidelity, BlackRock has also launched crypto-related ETFs and has stated that it is awaiting regulatory clarity to delve into direct crypto exposure. These firms with their massive reach could be a potential catalyst to drive BTC and the crypto market to new levels of mainstream adoption. Institutional investors have also been known to drive crypto prices to new highs with their investments.

    "content": "Tickmill ReviewTickmill is a Metatrader broker, a member of the Tickmill Group is a regulated platform by the Seychelles Financial Services Authority, as Tickmill reviews show. The broker has put itself in a strong position as a trusted market leader as the Tickmill broker review show. But, do all traders think Tickmill is a decent broker? Let\u2019s find out in our Tickmill reviews and analysis.The brokerage was built by traders that already had some trading experience from back in the day when they traded on financial markets across the world. The goal now according to the Tickmill review is to provide institutional clients as well as retail clients with a trading platform that will help them reach their full potential.Tickmill is a MetaTrader broker that offers a small selection of tradeable securities and offers high commission-based pricing via its VIP And PRO accounts.ProsTickmill is regulated in one tier-1 jurisdiction and two tier-2 jurisdictions. The platform offers a wide suite of Metatrader features and various add-ons. The pricing for the accounts is highly competitive and It also offers the CQG platform for options and futures trading. ConsThere are only a few markets available for trading. The pricing for the classic accounts is not competitive.The platform is considered an average risk and it is not publicly traded.Tickmill OfferingsTickmill offers 85 tradeable assets such as CFDs on currency pairs, metals, indices, crypto, and bonds. There are 62 symbols available for futures and options trading via a separate account.Also, crypto trading at Tickmill is available via CFDs but not via trading of an underlying asset like BTC. Crypto CFDs are also not available to retail traders in the UK.Commissions and feesCFDS come with high risks of losing money due to leverage. Up to 76% of the retail CFD accounts lose money according to Tickmill bonus review. Always make sure you understand how CFDs work and know to invest only the amounts you can lose.Tickmill offers three accounts: Classic, Pro, and VIP.-Classic: the classic account is commission free but traders only pay the bid or ask spread. However, the average spreads for this account are higher than the other two account types.PRO account: this account type alongside the VIP account has a per-trade commission which is added to lower spreads. The low commission rate and low-cost spreads, make this account ideal for traders.Traders that choose the VIP Account will have to maintain a balance of $50,000 and will have access to the low commission of $1 per standard lot. The Pro account can be accessed with only a $100 deposit but will have twice as high a commission per standard lot.Deposit and withdrawalsDepositing and withdrawing money from Tickmill is simple as the Tickmill broker review shows. The broker accepts most forms of payments that include bank transfer credit and debit cards, crypto wallets, and e-wallets. The company doesn\u2019t impose fees for making deposits and withdrawals while its processing system is fast.The payouts are also processed fast so they are set to review their minimum withdrawal amount right in their wallets or bank accounts. TickMill processes payment instantly but it does take 24 hours for the bank to clear the transaction. Also, the broker sends a payment confirmation message to the users\u2019 phones or emails after the payout is cleared according to the Tickmill withdrawal review.The clients do have to deposit $100 to open an account. It accepts deposits in USD, EUR, GBP, and PLN. It accepts cryptos like LTC, ETH, and BTC. The broker also allows the deposit of funds in ten payment system modes like credit cards, bank transfer, Skrill, Neteller, UnionPay, FASAPAY, QIWI, WEB MONEY, STICPAY, and more. There are no deposit fees to be paid.Since there are no fees to be paid to the broker, the user has to initiate a request and wait for a day to receive the minimum withdrawal amount in their account. The minimum amount for withdrawal is set at $10 but the users might have to submit ID proof for KYC verification processes if the amount is too high.TickMill Trading PlatformsTickmill is a MetaTrader-only broker and there are both Android and iOS versions of the MT4 and MT5 available for download. The platform also launched a mobile app for account management purposes as well. It even launched the Mt5 from the UK and the EU while adding TradingView as a new feature.Tickmill included the CQG platform for futures and options trading. The Trdaingview feature on the other hand is very popular among traders according to Tickmill reviews due to the powerful charting and visualizations.Other notable add-ons are available as well like the Advanced Trading toolkit and the VPS hosting.Tickmill Fees And AccountsClassic AccountTraders don\u2019t have to pay a commission fee for trading with this account on the broker\u2019s website. The trader does however need to pay the spread cost between the asking price and the bid price for trading the products. The average spread price is higher for the Classic account and it is often not preferred by beginners.SpreadsAccording to the Tickmill review, the PRO accounts offer users a spread of 0.13 pips for the EUR/USD pairs. The trading costs stand at 0.53 pips with the RT commission of 0.4 pips taken into consideration. Also, online brokerage platforms usually record the spread statistics under market conditions especially when the spreads are narrow.DiscountsTickmill offers traders a few discount options. The discounts start at the rate of $0.25 for a standard trade, up to a thousand micro-lots every month. At the third level, the discount package is $0.75 for traders that trade more than 3000 standard lots each month.FAQIs Tickmill regulated?Tickmill is regulated by the Seychelles Financial Services authority while its trading name under Tickmill UK LTC is authorized by the Financial Conduct Authority of the UK. Tickmill Europe LTD is also regulated by the Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission.2. Are there any fees for withdrawals in crypto?this broker doesn\u2019t charge fees for traders to and from its wallets for crypto deposits and withdrawals but the fees are likely applied by the crypto providers.3. Are my funds safe?Since Tickmill is regulated three-way, the funds are generally safe. the platform\u2019s internal systems are compliant with regulators. The Review Tickmill 7 Score Tickmill is a Metatrader broker, a member of the Tickmill Group which is a regulated platform by the Seychelles Financial Services Authority.

    "content": "Global markets jittered as Chinese citizens took to the streets to demonstrate against the government\u2019s strict \u201czero-COVID\u201d strategy over the weekend. The protests\u2019 immediate impact on global markets is raising questions about the way forward for the world\u2019s second-biggest economy. On Monday, the Dow fell more than 500 points after declines in the European and Asian indexes, along with a plunge in oil prices as U.S. oil fell to its lowest price in nearly a year. Cryptocurrencies also saw a slump as one economist told Bloomberg that zero-COVID policies posed a challenge to stabilizing domestic demand for crypto assets. [time-brightcove not-tgx=\u201dtrue\u201d] Most markets had regained ground by Tuesday after Chinese health authorities reported an uptick in senior vaccination rates. The pan-European Stoxx 600 was flat, while in the U.S., the S&P 500 hovered around the flatline and the Dow lost 41 points. Oil steadied after OPEC+ kept its output unchanged, with Brent crude futures up 48 cents at $83.67 a barrel. Read More: Protests Against Zero-COVID Are Rocking China. Here\u2019s What You Need to Know China\u2019s economy is already inflexible under the central control of the Communist Party, led by President Xi Jinping, but experts fear that it will become more sluggish if widespread lockdowns continue to threaten the global supply chain and fuel civil unrest. Shortly after Xi began his third term in October, the government again buckled down on its zero-COVID policies, leading to an underwhelming stock market, a weakening renminbi and capital outflows\u2014making it a difficult year for the country\u2019s economic outlook and for China\u2019s investors. Most analysts suggest that the government will need to take a more pragmatic approach to fix its economy, including loosening its COVID-19 restrictions and vaccinating higher numbers of the elderly, which is considered vital to reopening the economy. According to the latest official statistics, 32% of China\u2019s 267 million people over the age of 60 have still not received their third vaccine dose. On Monday, Mi Feng, a spokesman from the National Health Commission, reaffirmed Beijing\u2019s commitment to the zero-COVID measures. He added that complaints about the strict prevention and control measures fell under the purview of the local authorities, saying they must respond to and resolve \u201creasonable\u201d COVID-19 requests from the public in a timely manner. But rumors abound that authorities may ease restrictions with a zero-COVID exit plan, with the hope that an eventual reopening would lead to a rise in the Asian markets. Michael Hirson of 22V Research told Yahoo! Finance that the possibility of reopening is increasing as the population and local governments clearly reach exhaustion from maintaining zero-COVID policies. However, he warned that \u201ca chaotic pivot [in government policies] is likely to be highly disruptive to the economy\u2013quite possibly worse than zero-COVID, at least in the near term.\u201d",

    "description": "Historically, bull markets describe the rising of market value, while the bear market implies the falling of market value.",
    "content": "In the crypto world, the terms bull market and bear market have been adopted from their financial-market counterparts. Since you know the crypto market is volatile, prices can fluctuate rapidly, rising and falling in a matter of hours. It is, therefore, necessary for you to be well-versed to generate a consistent income from trading. For instance, if you have enough knowledge regarding chart patterns cheat sheets of the top 20 profitable chart formations, it will help you identify profitable trade setups.\u00a0 So now come to the main business. Here in this article, we will explore the difference between crypto bull and bear markets. Let's proceed! Bull market: What Is It? The term \"bull market\" was coined in traditional finance (TradFi), based on bulls' fighting style: thrusting their horns upward. Investors have used this phrase, with its upward trajectory in mind, to refer to the general market mood. Bull markets are characterized by rapid upward movement in prices. What Factors Contribute to a Bull Market? A bull market is a period of rising stock prices, usually as part of an economic recovery. Economic expansion, rising gross domestic product (GDP), falling interest rates, and higher employment are the factors that cause bull markets. Traders sometimes pay too much attention to the general opinion of financial markets, which is influenced by market emotions. Given how investors are motivated, it's easy to understand why bull markets tend to occur when several conditions exist. Features of a Crypto Bull Market Common behaviors and attitudes that define a bull market include: Poor supply despite high demand; A rise in market confidence among investors; Price increases that are sustained throughout time; Mainstream media and social media outlets are starting to mention cryptocurrencies; Overcharging for some projects hard price increases after positive news; A modest decrease in pricing when negative news is announced. Bear Market: What Is It? A bear market is when the prices of stocks and other securities are falling. An economic recession or financial crisis often causes a bear market. It can also result from negative investor sentiment, which puts downward pressure on share prices. What factors contribute to a bear market? When the economy first faces a downturn or immediately afterward, a bear market can begin. A bear market is usually caused by worsening economic conditions, such as hiring freezes and high inflation costs. These indications suggest that a recession is beginning, which will affect most investors. As a result, many people will sell off their riskier investments and invest the money in safer ones like gold or government bonds. Features of a Crypto Bear Market Common behaviors and attitudes that define a bear market include: Price declines can last for a long time; The supply outweighs the demand; Investors' lack of faith in the market; No mentions of cryptocurrencies on any social media or in the news; The general mistrust of cryptocurrency by experts and economists; Lower highs following excellent news; In the event of unfavorable news, lower lows. Major Differences Between a Bull and a Bear Market The major difference between a bull and a bear market is that they are opposite in nature. Demand and supply In a bull market, there is a high demand for cryptocurrencies and a low supply. Many investors want to purchase cryptocurrencies, but few are willing to give up their money.\u00a0 However, in a bear market, many people are buying than selling.\u00a0 Because there is less demand than there is supply, prices are falling. The Situation in the Market A market enters a bull market when the GDP rises, while a market enters a bear market when the GDP declines. This is so because expanding GDP usually coincides with rising business income and employee wages. Conversely, GDP declines when business revenues are poor, and salaries are flat or declining. Impact on the Economy A slow economy and a bear market go hand in hand. Businesses' earnings fall, and the economy suffers when customers don't spend enough and companies don't reach their revenue targets. On the other hand, a bull market is associated with a booming economy, in which earnings are stronger, and consumer spending is greater. Conclusion Cryptocurrencies are volatile assets, and their value is in constant flux. Trading in the crypto market differs from trading on the stock market. Since there are fewer traders and more unpredictable movements, it is important to know how to trade in a bearish or bullish market. So hopefully, our round-up will help you in this regard.\u00a0 Finally, if you are searching for a viable platform for investing in cryptocurrency or digital assets, you can pick Margex. Margex is designed to be a user-friendly and intuitive trading platform. It will provide you with a seamless experience from start to finish, whether you are buying or selling cryptocurrencies.",

    "description": "The Texas Securities Board has asked the judge to consider leveling a cease-and-desist order, administrative fines, and forced refunds against SBF and FTX US.",
    "content": "Former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried has been called to a Feb. 2 hearing by the Texan securities regulator as part of an investigation into whether he and FTX US have violated Texas securities laws. In a Notice of Hearing signed off by Texas State Securities Board\u2019s (SSB\u2019s) director of enforcement Joe Rotunda and served to Bankman Fried on Nov. 29, the regulator alleges that FTX US offered unregistered securities to Texans through its \u201cEARN\u201d accounts. The investigation was first announced on Oct. 14, before the dramatic collapse and bankruptcy of FTX\u2019s global operations. The regulator announced at the time it was investigating FTX Trading and FTX US and its principals including Sam Bankman-Fried for offering unregistered securities through its yield-bearing products. On Nov. 18, Rotunda used Twitter to appeal to the public to reach out to him if they were a previous client of FTX and based in Texas. If you\u2019re a client if @FTX_Official and you live in Texas, please reach out to me. We want to hear your story. My Texas State Securities Board email address is jrotunda@ssb.texas.gov. In the latest notice, the SSB alleged that Sam Bankman-Fried violated a section of the Securities Act during his role as the then-CEO of FTX. \u201cRespondent [Sam Bankman-Fried] violated Section 4003.001 of the Securities Act by offering and selling securities in Texas that were not registered or permitted for sale in Texas,\u201d said Rotunda, adding it also didn\u2019t register as a dealer or agent in Texas. The regulator said it hoped that the hearing will lead to a Cease and Desist order to prevent FTX from \u201cengaging in fraud in connection with the offer or sale of securities in Texas.\u201d It was also \u201cpraying\u201d for the judge to order Bankman-Fried to return money to Texan customers that had invested in its \u201cunregistered EARN accounts.\u201d The regulator also wants consideration of an \u201cadministrative fine\u201d to be issued to Bankman-Fried should he have gained any economic benefit from the securities law violations. This amount wouldn\u2019t exceed $20,000 per violation but could go to $250,000 for every \u201cillegal or fraudulent act\u201d that was perpetrated against Texans over the age of 65. Rotunda said the hearing will commence at 9am local time on Feb. 2, 2023, and Bankman-Fried can attend the hearing using Zoom. Related: \u2018I never opened the code for FTX\u2019: SBF has long, candid talk with vlogger Bankman-Fried is understood to currently be in the Bahamas. In a recently published interview between crypto blogger Tiffany Fong and Bankman-Fried, the former FTX CEO expressed remorse over his handling of FTX and the bankruptcy filing. \u201cYou don\u2019t get into the situation we got in if you, like, make all the right decisions,\u201d he said in the recently released Nov. 16 interview.",

    "content": "The Real Vision Bot is known for outperforming the digital asset market, and its historic performance was recently labeled as \u201castonishing\u201d by Real Vision founder and macro guru Raoul Pal. Real Vision Bot has conducted a survey in a bid to come up with algorithmic portfolio assessments said to generate a \u201chive mind\u201d consensus. Real Vision Bot co-founded by quant analyst Moritz Seibert and statistician Moritz Heidena conducted a survey in a bid to come up with algorithmic portfolio assessments said to generate a \u201chive mind\u201d consensus. According to the results, the majority of the market participants voted to have a strong preference for Ethereum. Apart from Ethereum, the participants voted to overweight their portfolio with Polygon (Matic). The third asset on the participants\u2019 list is Bitcoin. The most surprising inclusion is Matic, which is the first-ever pick by the Real Vision Bot. Latest allocation of the free RealVision Exchange crypto portfolio and the Bot\u2019s choice. Polygon has taken the lead for the first time in the survey, followed by USDC, Ethereum, and AVAX. The Bot isn\u2019t that sure about the latter one and keeps ~10% in Bitcoin. The survey also disclosed Tether USD (USDT), followed by Avalanche (AVAX), Cosmos (ATOM), and Polkadot (DOT) are highly tipped to outperform the market. The crypto market has been underperforming for some time after the Terra and the FTX ecosystem collapse triggering a mass sell-off. The results of this survey indicate that there is a higher expectation that the market could bounce back. Ethereum records increasing unique addresses The Real Vision Bot is known for outperforming the digital asset market, and its historic performance was recently labeled as \u201castonishing\u201d by Real Vision founder and macro guru Raoul Pal. According to him, its record of outperforming the aggregated bucket of top 20 crypto assets by 20 percent is laudable. This is more interesting considering that it takes surveys from traders. In March, Real Vision Bot published its survey-based portfolio allocation which was led by Ethereum and followed by Bitcoin, Terra, Polygon, and Polkadot. Within the period, it observed that portfolios added to their Ethereum and Luna holdings and also added other assets in smaller portions. Latest allocation of the RealVision Exchange crypto portfolio. Both the Exchange and the Bot increase their allocation to Ethereum and Terra. Cardano and VeChain make it back into the allocation. Overall quite a diverse mix of smaller positions. Ethereum was tipped for a huge price gain after the merge. Even though the price has not seen any significant surge, the number of unique addresses keeps increasing. During the time of the Ethereum upgrade, the total number of unique addresses stood at 205,410,380. As of October 14, the figure was around 208,018,737. This indicates that people are showing interest as they explore the network. Regardless of these, Ethereum\u2019s social activity faced a decline after the merge, recording 8.46 million social mentions and 24.07 billion social engagements as of October 6.

    "description": "FTX exchange collapse sent shock waves through the cryptocurrency community, so how did it happen and why? The post FTX Exchange: One of the Largest Crypto Exchanges Collapses first appeared on StealthEX.",
    "content": "During the year 2022, the crypto industry went through a series of shocks that added to the overall negative market trend. First, the stunning fall of the Terra stablecoin that happened in May made the overall crypto market unstable, wiping out more than $200 billion in the space. In June, Celsius posted a memo informing users that it had frozen their assets, sending the price of Bitcoin and other cryptos down along with it. The latest controversy came just this November, when one of the largest crypto exchanges called FTX collapsed. So how did it happen with the FTX exchange and why? What Is FTX Exchange? FTX crypto exchange was a leading centralized cryptocurrency exchange specializing in derivatives and leveraged products. Sam Bankman-Fried founded FTX in May 2019, and FTX began within Alameda Research, a trading firm founded by Bankman-Fried, Caroline Ellison, and other former employees of Jane Street in 2017, in Berkeley, California. FTX offered a range of trading products, including derivatives, options, volatility products, and leveraged tokens. It also provided spot markets in more than 300 cryptocurrency trading pairs such as BTC/USDT, ETH/USDT, XRP/USDT, and its native token FTT/USDT.\u00a0 At its peak in July 2021, FTX had over one million users and was the third-largest cryptocurrency exchange by volume. FTX is incorporated in Antigua and Barbuda and headquartered in the Bahamas. The crypto exchange is closely associated with FTX.US, a separate exchange available to US residents. Bahamas-based FTX and its FTX US affiliate had overlapping management teams but separate capital structures. U.S. residents could only trade through FTX US. The firm was developing rapidly and entered a number of successful partnerships. Changpeng Zhao of Binance purchased a 20% stake in FTX for approximately $100 million, six months after Bankman-Fried started the firm. In July 2021, FTX raised $900 million at an $18 billion valuation from over 60 investors, including Softbank, Sequoia Capital, and other firms. Additionally, Bankman-Fried bought out Zhao\u2019s stake for approximately $2 billion. FTX mostly rose to popularity through a series of high-profile acquisitions, aggressive marketing strategies and low trading fees. Major venture capital groups also bought in, investing almost $2 billion in the company. FTX First Problems The broader crypto industry decline due to the overall market recession had already forced many major platforms to shut down, but FTX seemed immune, even buying up some of its struggling competitors.\u00a0 But things began to change earlier this month, when the balance sheet of a crypto investing firm that was also owned by Bankman-Fried, Alameda Research, was published by CoinDesk, a crypto-focused digital media website. It showed that Alameda held a large amount of a crypto token created by FTX called FTT. And though that FTT crypto held a certain market value, if the price were to drop, Alameda would be at risk of insolvency.\u00a0 FTT was minted by FTX exchange and given out as rewards to users. The FTT coin was also less transparent than other tokens, making it hard to track just how many tokens had been created. People could buy and sell FTT, but trading was relatively limited. Other platforms also held the token. The Scandal Around FTX Crypto Exchange and FTT Token After Alameda\u2019s balance sheet was leaked, Changpeng Zhao announced on November 6 that his company would sell off all its FTT tokens. The price of the FTT token dropped sharply. The leaked balance sheet provides more fodder for critics who say there is an unhealthy overlap between SBF\u2019s trading company and its exchange. But there was clearly more to Binance\u2019s decision to sell off his FTT tokens, as Zhao himself suggested. Meanwhile, as the price dropped, many FTX customers moved to withdraw their assets from the platform. Though the extent of the connections between Alameda and FTX were not yet public, a series of recent crypto platform collapses had already put the crypto community on edge. Those withdrawals would end up resembling a classic bank run, in which people worried about a bank\u2019s solvency rush to get their money out before it runs out of cash. Billions of dollars poured out of the platform. This sealed FTX\u2019s fate. On November 8, FTX stopped allowing customers to take money out of the platform. The Crisis and Its Aftermath Media organizations including Bloomberg, the Financial Times, The Wall Street Journal, and others cited anonymous sources saying that FTX needed $8 billion to cover the gap between what it owed and what it could pay out. NBC News has not verified those reports, and Bankman-Fried said in an interview that he needed to raise $8 billion in the next two weeks to make things right with account holders. Some sources reported that Alameda had used FTX funds for trading. According to a report, after the collapse of FTX, Sam Banksman-Fried stepped down as CEO and was reported to have moved to Argentina. Though these rumors may not be true, as he lives in Nassau, he was tweeting about his thoughts on the firm\u2019s crisis shortly after the event. Sam Bankman-Fried also confirmed that the exchange was using Alameda\u2019s bank accounts to wire customer deposits. Some customers were reportedly asked to wire their deposits through Alameda, which had a banking partnership with fintech bank Silvergate Capital. The collision between Alameda and FTX over the customer\u2019s fund later became the main point of failure. Bankman-Fried had claimed that even though FTX never gambled users\u2019 funds, it did loan them to Alameda. The former CEO claimed that he thought Alameda had enough collateral to back the loans, but as reports have suggested, a majority of it was in the native FTX token.\u00a0 What was once a $32 billion global empire has imploded in recent weeks. As a result, rival Binance had signed a letter of intent to buy FTX\u2019s international business as it faced a liquidity crunch.\u00a0 Down the Rabbit Hole As the story keeps unfolding, we learn more and more about the infamous crypto exchange and what Bankman-Fried has been up to. And this saga seems to be endless. All in all, Bankman-Fried saw the bulk of his net worth drop from $15.6 billion to $1 billion in a single day. This happened after news broke that his cryptocurrency exchange, FTX, needed a bailout. Now, it\u2019s come out that as much as $2 billion in customer funds are missing \u2013 and questions are arising over just how Bankman-Fried bankrolled his high-end lifestyle.\u00a0 According to a bankruptcy lawyer and Sullivan & Cromwell restructuring partner James Bromley, FTX spent around $300 million buying houses in the Bahamas for senior executives. Those lawyers are helping guide FTX through the bankruptcy process, where customers hope they can recover at least some of their funds after FTX filed for bankruptcy. Bromley said that the company had been run by \u2018a small group of inexperienced and unsophisticated individuals.\u2019 He added that the companies across the FTX network had \u2018unreliable books and records.\u2019 The FTX Group had 520 employees as of the end of October, including 330 employees across the globe registered at the US company, Bromley said. The latter has since fallen to around 260, he said. \u2018The whole operation was run by a gang of kids in the Bahamas,\u2019 a person familiar with the matter told one of the largest crypto sources. When his cryptocurrency exchange started teetering in early November, Sam Bankman-Fried went on Twitter to calm everyone down. A little-known figure outside crypto circles, Alameda\u2019s CEO Ms. Caroline Ellison claimed repeatedly that Mr. Bankman-Fried\u2019s empire was on stable financial footing. Conspiracy Theories The collapse has led some social media users to claim the cryptocurrency exchange was laundering U.S. aid sent to Ukraine and passing it along to Democrats to help with the midterm elections.\u00a0 It is true that Bankman-Fried has donated large sums to Democrats. Records show he and other FTX executives also have donated to conservative groups. As a matter of fact, Ukraine partnered with FTX when it launched a website allowing people to donate cryptocurrency to support the country, but multiple people involved have rejected the money-laundering claim. Ukraine\u2019s government \u2018never invested any funds into FTX,\u2019 Alex Bornyakov, the deputy minister of digital transformation in Ukraine said on Twitter. Vedant Patel, principal deputy spokesperson at the State Department, said \u2018monitoring mechanisms we have in place have not detected a deviation from the funds\u2019 expected use.\u2019 A spokesperson for the U.S. Agency for International Development said these safeguards put in place by the World Bank, coupled with expert third-party monitoring support within the Ukrainian government, ensure accountability around the use of the funds. However, despite the controversial statements, FTX and lawyers representing the company did not respond to requests for comment. Conclusion FTX\u2019s collapse sent shock waves through the crypto community. And even though the fate of the infamous crypto exchange is unknown, it\u2019s not too difficult to see that it\u2019ll take a long time for it to recover, if ever.

    "content": "About 140 million babies were born globally last year\u2014the equivalent of adding an entire new Russia to the world\u2019s population. Not counted among those typically blessed events are the number of families whose pregnancies end tragically. According to the United Nations Interagency Group for Child Mortality Estimation, about 2 million pregnancies around the world end in stillbirth each year. The causes of natal death are numerous\u2014from fetal abnormalities to labor complications to maternal hypertension to infections to placental malformation. Now, according to a new study in Nature Communications, there is another, particularly pernicious cause that may account for up to 39.7% of stillbirths in low- and middle-income countries: air pollution, specifically in the form of fine particles measuring 2.5 microns\u2014or millionths of a meter\u2014or less. The particles, about 3% of the width of a human hair, typically come from vehicle exhaust, the burning of coal and heating oil, and natural sources like wildfires. [time-brightcove not-tgx=\u201dtrue\u201d] According to the new research, led by environmental scientist and public health specialist Tao Xue at Peking University Health Science Center in Beijing, every 10 micrograms\u2014or millionth of a gram\u2014of so-called PM2.5 particles per cubic meter of air increases the risk of stillbirth by 11%, with the toll greater on older mothers than younger ones. \u201cThe United Nations calls the global burden of stillbirths a neglected tragedy,\u201d the paper\u2019s authors write. \u201cPreventing stillbirths depends on a comprehensive understanding of the underlying risk factors.\u201d The World Health Organization (WHO) has established a so-called reference level\u2014or maximum safe exposure\u2014of PM2.5 at 5 micrograms per cubic meter of air. Above that level, the particles can contribute to heart disease, asthma, decreased lung function, and premature death in people with pre-existing heart or lung disease. Researchers have long drawn a potential link between PM2.5 exposure and stillbirth, but what they hadn\u2019t done, until Tao and his colleagues took the topic on, is to study how the burden falls disproportionately on people in poorer countries. According to the World Bank, the average global concentration of PM2.5 is an alarming 46 micrograms per cubic meter\u2014or nine times the WHO\u2019s reference level. But the burden is not spread equally. In Australia, it\u2019s a more tolerable 9 micrograms; in Canada, it\u2019s just six. The Bahamas clocks in at just 5.58. It\u2019s elsewhere, in the less developed world, that the pollution problem hits the hardest. To conduct their study, the investigators selected 137 low- and middle-income countries in which data from the Department of Health Surveys (DHS), a division of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), show are home to 98% of the world\u2019s incidence of stillbirths. They cross-indexed those mortality figures with other data from the WHO\u2019s Air Quality Guidelines detailing the severity of PM2.5 pollution in each of those countries. The results drew a bright line between the particulate emissions and the incidence of stillbirths. India, the hardest-hit country, with an annual average of 217,000 stillbirths (out of 25 million live births), had a PM2.5 concentration of 60.15 micrograms per cubic meter of air\u2014or 12 times the WHO\u2019s reference level. Pakistan, the second most severely affected country, with 110,000 stillbirths per year (compared to 6.075 million live births), weighed in at 63.16 micrograms of pollution. Following them were Nigeria (93,000 stillbirths, 7.8 million live births, and 69.66 micrograms); China (64,000 stillbirths, 10,6 million live births, and 51.11 micrograms), and Bangladesh (49,000 stillbirths, 2.8 million live births, and 69.58 micrograms). In addition to PM2.5 air pollution, the study also cites the possibility of naturally occurring high concentrations of dust\u2014particularly in sub-Saharan Africa and the Arabian Desert region\u2014as another source of dangerous particles. Maternal age played a significant role in the mortality risk. Relying on DHS data, as well as two existing meta-analyses of stillbirth incidence, the researchers calculated that mothers who lost their children at birth were, on average, 3.81 years older than those whose babies were born successfully. The greatest risk of stillbirth in high PM2.5 countries was among mothers ages 34 years or older. Just what the mechanism is that links PM2.5 concentration to stillbirth is uncertain. \u201cAlthough potential biological mechanisms for the association of PM2.5 exposure and pregnancy loss are not clear yet,\u201d the researchers wrote, \u201csome pathways can explain it to some extent.\u201d The researchers propose three possibilities. First, when a pregnant person inhales PM2.5 particles, they enter the bloodstream and may directly cross the placental barrier where they flow into the fetus, leading to low oxygen levels or immune problems in the baby, both of which can be associated with fetal death. There is also the possibility that exposure to PM2.5 can lead to the development of methemoglobin in the parent\u2014a form of hemoglobin that does not bind with oxygen and thus does not deliver sufficient quantities of oxygen to the fetus, also leading to immune problems and potentially death in the womb. Finally, PM2.5 can lead to abnormalities or malformations in the placenta itself, preventing it from sustaining a fetus throughout pregnancy. The outlook was not entirely bleak. The study notes that the global stillbirth rate actually decreased by 1.95% from 2000 to 2009, and fell again by 2.05% from 2009 to 2019. It attributes the trend to improved air quality in multiple countries\u201a notably China, that are taking slow steps away from coal-fired power plants and cleaning up their power grid with renewable sources of energy. In the meantime, pregnant people can take steps to reduce their exposure to PM2.5 pollution and better monitor the potential impact of the particles. Wearing N95 or KN95 masks outdoors on heavily polluted days, avoiding the outdoors when air quality is at its worst, and installing air purifiers in the home can all help. So too can improvements in prenatal care and timely intervention\u2014including cesarean sections\u2014in the case of premature or complicated labor. Pregnancy and childbirth have never been easy. But more often than they do now, they should result in a happy outcome. In 137 countries at least, our own poor stewardship of the health of the planet is too often denying families that joy.",

    "content": "A Eufy security camera, from Anker. | Image: Anker/Eufy Anker has built a remarkable reputation for quality over the past decade, building its phone charger business into an empire spanning all sorts of portable electronics \u2014 including the Eufy home security cameras we\u2019ve recommended over the years. Eufy\u2019s commitment to privacy is remarkable: it promises your data will be stored locally, that it \u201cnever leaves the safety of your home,\u201d that its footage only gets transmitted with \u201cend-to-end\u201d military-grade encryption, and that it will only send that footage \u201cstraight to your phone.\u201d So you can imagine our surprise to learn you can stream video from a Eufy camera, from the other side of the country, with no encryption at all. Screenshot by Sean Hollister / The Verge Part of Anker\u2019s Eufy \u201cprivacy commitment\u201d. Worse, it\u2019s not yet clear how widespread this might be \u2014 because instead of addressing it head-on, the company falsely claimed to The Verge that it wasn\u2019t even possible. On Thanksgiving Day, infosec consultant Paul Moore and a hacker who goes by Wasabi both alleged that Anker\u2019s Eufy cameras can stream encryption-free through the cloud \u2014 just by connecting to a unique address at Eufy\u2019s cloud servers with the free VLC Media Player. Ah well, the cats out the bag now... so may as well tell you.You can remotely start a stream and watch @EufyOfficial cameras live using VLC. No authentication, no encryption.Please don't ask for a PoC - I can't release this one.Heads up @TechLinkedYT @LinusTech https://t.co/sU3FyRaELX\u2014 Paul Moore (@Paul_Reviews) November 25, 2022 When we asked Anker point-blank to confirm or deny that, the company categorically denied it. \u201cI can confirm that it is not possible to start a stream and watch live footage using a third-party player such as VLC,\u201d Brett White, a senior PR manager at Anker, told me via email. But The Verge can now confirm that\u2019s not true. This week, we repeatedly watched live footage from two of our own Eufy cameras using that very same VLC media player, from across the United States \u2014 proving that Anker has a way to bypass encryption and access these supposedly secure cameras through the cloud. There is some good news: there\u2019s no proof yet that this has been exploited in the wild, and the way we initially obtained the address required logging in with a username and password before Eufy\u2019s website will cough up the encryption-free stream. (We\u2019re not sharing the exact technique here.) Also, it seems like it only works on cameras that are awake. We had to wait until our floodlight camera detected a passing car, or its owner pressed a button, before the VLC stream came to life. Your camera\u2019s 16-digit serial number \u2014 likely visible on the box \u2014 is the biggest part of the key But it also gets worse: Eufy\u2019s best practices appear to be so shoddy that bad actors might be able to figure out the address of a camera\u2019s feed \u2014 because that address largely consists of your camera\u2019s serial number encoded in Base64, something you can easily reverse with a simple online calculator. The address also includes a Unix timestamp you can easily create, a token that Eufy\u2019s servers don\u2019t actually seem to be validating (we changed our token to \u201carbitrarypotato\u201d and it still worked), and a four-digit random hex whose 65,536 combinations could easily be brute forced. \u201cThis is definitely not how it should be designed,\u201d Mandiant vulnerability engineer Jacob Thompson tells The Verge. For one thing, serial numbers don\u2019t change, so a bad actor could give or sell or donate a camera to Goodwill and quietly keep watching the feeds. But also, he points out that companies don\u2019t tend to keep their serial numbers secret. Some stick them right on the box they sell at Best Buy \u2014 yes, including Eufy. On the plus side, Eufy\u2019s serial numbers are long at 16 characters and aren\u2019t just an increasing number. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to be able to just guess at IDs and begin hitting them,\u201d says Mandiant Red Team consultant Dillon Franke, calling it a possible \u201csaving grace\u201d of this disclosure. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t sound quite as bad as if it\u2019s UserID 1000, then you try 1001, 1002, 1003.\u201d It could be worse. When Georgia Tech security researcher and Ph.D. candidate Omar Alrawi was studying poor, smart home practices in 2018, he saw some devices substituting their own MAC address for security \u2014 even though a MAC address is only twelve characters long, and you can generally figure out the first six characters just by knowing which company made a gadget, he explains. \u201cThe serial number now becomes critical to keep secret.\u201d But we also don\u2019t know how else these serial numbers might leak, or if Eufy might even unwittingly provide them to anyone who asks. \u201cSometimes there are APIs that will return some of that unique ID information,\u201d says Franke. \u201cThe serial number now becomes critical to keep secret, and I don\u2019t think they\u2019d treat it that way.\u201d Thompson also wonders whether there are other potential attack vectors now that we know Eufy\u2019s cameras aren\u2019t wholly encrypted: \u201cIf the architecture is such that they can order the camera to start streaming at any time, anyone with admin access has the ability to access the IT infrastructure and watch your camera,\u201d he warns. That\u2019s a far cry from Anker\u2019s claim that footage is \u201csent straight to your phone\u2014and only you have the key.\u201d By the way, there are other worrying signs that Anker\u2019s security practices may be much, much poorer than it has let on. This whole saga started when infosec consultant Moore started tweeting accusations that Eufy had violated other security promises, including uploading thumbnail images (including faces) to the cloud without permission and failing to delete stored private data. Anker reportedly admitted to the former, but called it a misunderstanding. You have some serious questions to answer @EufyOfficial Here is irrefutable proof that my supposedly \"private\", \"stored locally\", \"transmitted only to you\" doorbell is streaming to the cloud - without cloud storage enabled.#privacyhttps://t.co/u4iGgkWkJB\u2014 Paul Moore (@Paul_Reviews) November 23, 2022 Most worrying if true, he also claims that Eufy\u2019s encryption key for its video footage is literally just the plaintext string \u201cZXSecurity17Cam@\u201d. That phrase also appears in a GitHub repo from 2019, too. Anker didn\u2019t answer The Verge\u2019s straightforward yes-or-no question about whether \u201cZXSecurity17Cam@\u201d is the encryption key. We couldn\u2019t get more details from Moore, either; he told The Verge he can\u2019t comment further now that he\u2019s started legal proceedings against Anker. Now that Anker has been caught in some big lies, it\u2019s going to be hard to trust whatever the company says next \u2014 but for some, it may be important to know which cameras do and do not behave this way, whether anything will be changed, and when. When Wyze had a vaguely similar vulnerability, it swept it under the rug for three years; hopefully, Anker will do far, far better. Some may not be willing to wait or trust anymore. \u201cIf I came across this news and had this camera inside my home, I\u2019d immediately turn it off and not use it, because I don\u2019t know who can view it and who cannot,\u201d Alrawi tells me. Wasabi, the security engineer who showed us how to get a Eufy camera\u2019s network address, says he\u2019s ripping all of his out. \u201cI bought these because I was trying to be security conscious!\u201d he exclaims. With some specific Eufy cams, you could perhaps try switching them to use Apple\u2019s HomeKit Secure Video instead. With reporting and testing by Jen Tuohy and Nathan Edwards",

    "description": "Despite positives, Avalanche may struggle to fit this list",
    "content": "Contents Avalanche token also has many advantages Why hasn\u2019t cryptocurrency skyrocketed even though it has all those benefits? (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Does Avalanche (AVAX) have a chance to become the great \u201cEthereum Killer?\u201d The altcoin has the fundamentals to stand out on the market, but how far can this make Avalanche grow? Avalanche's main purpose is to be a peer competitor to Ethereum (ETH). Therefore, it already discards with its network the main problems that are found on the main altcoin on the market, such as high fees and a slow network. Avalanche promises to make 4,500 transactions per second, compared to ETH, which makes just 14 in the same period. But within the category of \u201cEthereum Killer,\u201d all Ethereum competitors have the aforementioned qualities. However, Avalanche has other important highlights that make it a serious contender. window.coinzilla_display = window.coinzilla_display || []; var c_display_preferences = {}; c_display_preferences.zone = \"5335d7792eb489ae565\"; c_display_preferences.width = \"300\"; c_display_preferences.height = \"250\"; coinzilla_display.push(c_display_preferences); Ads window.coinzilla_display = window.coinzilla_display || []; var c_display_preferences = {}; c_display_preferences.zone = \"5335d7792eb489ae565\"; c_display_preferences.width = \"300\"; c_display_preferences.height = \"250\"; coinzilla_display.push(c_display_preferences); Ads Its scalability, for example, is possible, as the altcoin has three individual blockchains with different purposes: X-Chain: Decentralized platform for creating and trading smart digital assets; C-Chain: Allows the creation of smart contracts; P-Chain: Coordinates validators, tracks active subnets and allows the creation of new subnets. It is worth mentioning that Avalanche's consensus mechanism is differentiated according to its use cases. Additionally, the altcoin has been working on interoperability between its blockchain and Ethereum. Avalanche token also has many advantages When a user transacts with AVAX, the transaction fee is burned, bringing scarcity to the altcoin. Furthermore, the token is used to secure the network through the staking process, pay fees and provide a basic unit of accounting between the various subnets created on the Avalanche platform. Another point is that AVAX has an impressive performance in platform economics. This is because Avalanche offers a variety of services, such as peer-to-peer lending, trading and creating subnets. All of these require the developer to have AVAX to enjoy them. Why hasn\u2019t cryptocurrency skyrocketed even though it has all those benefits? First, it is possible to mention that the hype of Ethereum competitors did not last long. The emergence of ETH 2.0 makes the existence of an \u201cEthereum Killer\u201d questionable. In addition, Avalanche has many rivals that also have positive highlights, such as Polkadot (DOT) and Cardano (ADA). The high amount invested to become a cryptocurrency validator is also a significant negative. With altcoins like ADA , for example, you do not have to be an investment whale to earn passive income from staking; AVAX requiring at least 2,000 tokens to be an Avalanche validator is self-defeating. The amount of tokens mentioned represents an investment of USD $24,000 at the time of writing. Even with the major market correction that Avalanche went through, without a doubt, it is not an investment that any investor can make. Scalability solutions and Ethereum finalizing its transition to version 2.0, where the altcoin, according to Vitalik Buterin, will make 100,000 transactions per second, may end Avalanche's promise of prominence on the market, even with its positive points.",

    "content": "Crypto Twitter wasn't in the room where it happened, but the chattering class on the birdsite had plenty of thoughts about Sam Bankman-Fried's one-on-one interview with Andrew Ross Sorkin as part of a New York Times conference. The Dealbook Summit is an annual event hosted by the Times . and the session moderator Andrew Ross Sorkin is an award-winning journalist, CNBC anchor, and author of \"Too Big to Fail,\" the story of the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the 2008 financial crisis. Sorkin is also the co-creator of the Showtime series Billions and the founder of Dealbook. Sorkin asked Bankman-Fried if his lawyers suggested speaking at the conference was a good idea. \"No,\u201d Bankman-Fried replied. \u201cThey are very much not,\" adding that he felt he had a duty to speak.

    "content": "The world of can be confusing and even a little scary. With so many new companies, technologies, and laws coming into play every day, it\u2019s easy to get lost in the details. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve put together this list of countries where cryptocurrency is legal and illegal worldwide. By the end of this article, you\u2019ll have all the information you need about which nations are on board with crypto\u2014and which ones aren\u2019t! The laws and regulations surrounding cryptocurrency vary greatly from country to country. For example, some nations have taken an accommodating stance on digital currency transactions, while others have imposed strict regulations or even banned cryptocurrencies altogether. This means that whether something is legal or illegal depends largely on where you are located. In the United States, for example, cryptocurrency is legal as long as it\u2019s used for transaction purposes and not for investment speculation. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has issued guidance stating that \u201cvirtual currencies held by taxpayers as a capital asset may be taxed as property\u201d. Consequently, individuals must pay taxes on gains they make from trading digital currencies like . Other countries, such as China, have taken a more restrictive approach and prohibited banks from engaging in any crypto-related activities; while other nations such as Japan are still in the process of developing a legal framework to govern virtual currencies. When it comes to cryptocurrencies, there is one thing you can say with certainty: they are functional everywhere. Cryptocurrency is a virtual form of payment available in every country in the world. Bitcoin is the most popular cryptocurrency and has been used as a method of payment by many businesses since it was introduced in 2009. The key to understanding why this is true is understanding what cryptocurrencies really are and how they work. Cryptocurrencies are decentralized currencies that are not backed by any government or central bank (unlike traditional currencies). This means that even if your government bans cryptocurrency or makes its use illegal, you will still be able to trade them at other exchanges located outside your country\u2019s jurisdiction (and vice versa). Cryptocurrency is legal in some form or another in 123 countries. These include the United States, which has a clear stance on cryptocurrency. On the other side of things are countries like Venezuela, whose citizens have been arrested for mining cryptocurrencies and Ecuador, where mining is considered money laundering and can result in up to eight years in prison. Not only are certain countries banning cryptocurrency, but they are also making it a criminal activity. This means that if you are caught with crypto in one of these countries, you could be arrested and even jailed. The following list is a compilation of the 9 countries where cryptocurrency is illegal or criminal: There are currently a number of countries without a clear stance on cryptocurrency, or where regulations have not yet been put into place. This generally means that there is an implicit ban (financial institutions are not allowed to take on crypto clients) regarding cryptocurrencies in these places. These include: Tax regulations related to cryptocurrencies also vary depending on which jurisdiction you\u2019re in. In some countries, digital currencies are considered commodities for tax purposes and are thus subject to capital gains taxes; whereas in other places they may be treated differently depending on how they\u2019re used and whether or not they\u2019re classified as an investment instrument or a currency itself. Taxpayers must familiarize themselves with the applicable laws and regulations of their local jurisdiction to ensure compliance with taxation laws when trading digital currencies. Due to their decentralized nature and lack of regulation across international borders, government interventions have become both necessary and frequent within the crypto market. Some countries have imposed bans or restrictions on cryptocurrency usage within their borders; while others have implemented measures to protect investors against scams or fraudulent activities involving digital assets. This can range from requiring companies dealing with virtual currencies to register with the appropriate authorities, to setting up dedicated agencies that monitor crypto trading activity within certain jurisdictions. When it comes to enforcing laws surrounding cryptocurrencies due to their decentralized nature and lack of a central authority overseeing them across all jurisdictions internationally- there exist certain challenges which law enforcement agencies face when attempting to hold individuals accountable for illegal activities carried out using digital assets. This includes difficulties verifying ownership of virtual coins or , tracking suspicious transactions made through anonymous wallets, determining jurisdictional boundaries of applicable laws among different countries involved in a particular transaction etc. The legal status of cryptocurrency varies substantially from country to country and is still undefined or changing in many of them. While some countries have explicitly allowed their use and trade, others have banned or restricted it. Similarly, various government agencies, departments, and courts have classified Bitcoin differently. While this article provides the legal status of bitcoin worldwide, laws can always change. As such it is important to ask your local government regulators for up-to-date information on their position regarding bitcoin before starting a project that will use Bitcoin as a payment method. In conclusion, it is clear that cryptocurrency is legal in some form or another throughout most of the world. However, there are still some countries where it is not legal yet or there is no clear stance on how to regulate this new type of currency. The countries where cryptocurrency has been banned altogether include China while others like Venezuela are considering following suit.",

Although the FCA is taking steps to reduce the risk, about 80% of the market participants are losing money, and some brokers are still not complying with the set guidelines. </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">According to the accompanying press release, the FCA's action stopped 24 firms from <a href=\"https://www.financemagnates.com/terms/m/marketing/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"48d4594c-de24-47ac-9f1b-aa2e0da8374a_1\" class=\"terms__secondary-term\">marketing</a> CFDs in the UK in the last two years. Activities undertaken in the previous year alone prevented \u00a3100 million in financial harm. </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">The FCA notes that 'poor practices' refers to only a small percentage of firms, especially those offering their services to the UK from overseas. In the worst cases, the regulator has identified instances of false advertising involving celebrities, aggressive sales tactics and investment advice offerings without proper authorization. Dishonest operating companies try to force consumers to deposit large sums of money, often beyond their financial capacity and level of risk aversion.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\"We have set out the standards we expect CFD firms to demonstrate in order to protect consumers and ensure market integrity. CFD providers authorised in our regime must sell products appropriately, and when the new consumer duty comes into effect, will need to ensure that products deliver good outcomes for retail consumers. We will not hesitate to take swift and assertive action where we identify harm,\" Sarah Pritchard, the Executive Director of Markets at the FCA, commented.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">The <a href=\"https://www.financemagnates.com/tag/fca/\" target=\"_blank\">FCA </a>expects all companies which received the letter to take appropriate action on the concerns raised by January 2023.</p><p>Ongoing Focus on the CFD Sector</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">The FCA's increased activity in the CFD sector stems from the wider Consumer Investments strategy. The triyearly plan was <a href=\"https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/corporate-documents/consumer-investments-strategy\">published</a> in mid-September and aims to create a consumer investment market in which trading can be made with an understanding of the risks involved, with access to the regulator's protection and confidence.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">In October, the regulator <a href=\"https://www.financemagnates.com/forex/fca-stops-16-suspected-cfds-providers/\">published data on consumer harm</a> from 1 April 2021 to 31 March 2022. As part of its ongoing efforts, the FCA stopped 33 consumer investment firms and saved traders from multimillion-dollar losses.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Last week, the FCA drew attention to <a href=\"https://www.financemagnates.com/forex/fca-warns-trading-app-operators-to-stop-the-trading-gamification/\">excessive gamification</a> in the retail investment industry. It issued a warning to trading app developers, saying they need to take a different approach to app design and reduce incentives that can lead to excessive trading.</p> This article was written by Damian Chmiel at www.financemagnates.com.",

    "description": "The European Central Bank put out a blog yesterday heavily maligning Bitcoin. Rarely being used for legal transactions was one its allegations. The European Central Bank (ECB) published a blog on Wednesday where it said that the number one cryptocurrency was on the \u201croad to irrelevance\u201d. The report pulled no punches and was scathing of Bitcoin. Bitcoin is rarely used for legal transactions\u00a0 Authors Ulrich Bindseil and J\u00fcrgen Schaaf included the above subtitle in their report but then made absolutely no reference at all to it within. There was no on-chain data or links to it in the text so it was left to the reader to believe the claim or not. According to blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis, illegal activity on the Bitcoin blockchain made up only 0.15% of the total transaction volume for the year 2021, which is the lowest it has ever been. Therefore the ECB author\u2019s use of such a subtitle might be taken as misleading in the extreme. The illegal transactions section of the ECB blog article was mainly filled with making the case that in the author\u2019s view, the value of Bitcoin was based purely on speculation, and that speculative bubbles were caused by new waves of investors coming in. Regulation can be misunderstood as approval The blog authors wanted to leave no doubt that regulation, when it arrives, does not give crypto any more legitimacy. They deplored the fact that large investors were funding lobbyists, who were in their turn trying to influence lawmakers. The fact that this is how the legislative process works for every single new piece of legislation, crypto or not, did not appear to make a difference. The slow speed of regulation, and the inability for all jurisdictions to agree on it was another area that the ECB complained about. That Bitcoin was perceived by the ECB to be an \u201cunprecedented polluter\u201d, was also shoe-horned into the regulation section. The claim was made that Bitcoin \u201cconsumes energy on the scale of entire economies\u201d.\u00a0 However, the comparisons did not include the banking industry. In an article from 2021, Bitcoin Magazine estimated that Bitcoin emitted 70 million Mt of CO2 annually, while bank branches and ATMs produced 400 million Mt each year. Promoting Bitcoin is a reputational risk for banks To end its blog article the ECB posited that Bitcoin was not suitable for payments nor as an investment, and therefore should not be seen as legitimised by regulation. Those in the financial industry were warned as to the reputational damage they could incur by promoting Bitcoin investments for short-term profits. It was felt that as Bitcoin will make further losses, the negative impact on banks that supported cryptocurrency might tarnish the whole banking industry. Of course, it might be wondered just how much more negativity could even be inflicted on the banking industry, given that it has been riddled with fraud and manipulation over many decades. Just for the year 2020 many hundreds of millions of dollars were paid in fines for misconduct by some of the biggest banks and financial institutions. In that year Wells Fargo alone had to pay $3 billion in fines for \u201chistoric account fraud stretching back years.\u201d Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Our HUGE staking dev update is LIVE!!! LOTS of NEW Token, NFT, Space, and performance features. $SOON holders begin staking your tokens TODAY. First reward happens on Dec 8th. LFGO! @shimmernet @iotahttps://t.co/Id4MSX7SXS pic.twitter.com/tqQsGjRw6m \u2014 SoonLabs | Soonaverse.com (@soon_labs) December 1, 2022 The Soonaverse platform allows communities to build NFT marketplaces, decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), projects, companies, etc. by leveraging the feeless infrastructure of the IOTA network. Earlier in September, Soonaverse had tested the minting of NFTs on the Shimmer blockchain network. While introducing its new staking feature, Soonaverse said: NFT creators will be happy to hear that they no longer need a badge to make a collection now that $SOON staking results in an anti-spamming mechanism. Users interested in staking their $SOON coins will have to do it for a minimum period of one week and it can go all the way up to 52 weeks. As users stake their $SOON tokens, they get locked. This staking and locking mechanism is unique to the Shimmer network. For staking, users won\u2019t need to send their tokens to a smart contract. Instead, they just need to specify the number of tokens they want to stake and the duration involved. These tokens shall appear automatically in your wallet with a time expiry condition. Despite staking the $SOON tokens, they remain 100% in the user\u2019s control. Interestingly, Soonaverse will offer 2x rewards if users stake their tokens for 52 weeks. Better NFT and token rankings After receiving some quality feedback on the NFT collections on Sonnaverse, they have now improved the sorting mechanism. This includes adding things like getting \u201cspaces with the most members\u201d at the top of the discovery page. This will give the popular collections greater visibility and the first impression as users land on the site. Interestingly, Soonaverse brings a greater level of decentralization to how tokens are ordered on their respective pages. This shall happen via a community-driven ranking system. Users who have staked the native $SOON tokens can either upvote or downvote collections and tokens in the Soonaverse. Soonaverse said that this will bring the most reputable projects to the top offering their greater visibility to its users. It added that: Guardians of a new ranking moderator space will then be able to use the upvote / downvote information to rate the collection or token on a scale of -100 to 100. The cumulative score of all guardians rankings will determine the order the collection or token shows up on its discovery page. Soonaverse said that it is working on a system that functions and manages different processes like decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs).

In a Dec. 1 hearing of the Senate Agriculture Committee exploring the collapse of FTX, Behnam said LedgerX had essentially been \u201cwalled off\u201d from many of the companies within FTX Group \u2014 including those that filed for bankruptcy \u2014 that provided a regulatory window for the CFTC. The CFTC chair said LedgerX was \u201chealthy\u201d, \u201csolvent\u201d, and \u201coperational\u201d compared to other FTX entities. \u201cThe limitations of our authority stopped at [LedgerX],\u201d said Behnam. \u201cFor those same reasons that we were walled off from going past the regulated entity, the other FTX entities were not able to pierce through LedgerX and potentially take customer money, which obviously, as a regulator, is the priority.\u201d In his written testimony for the hearing, the CFTC chair said : Behnan added that FTX had reported LedgerX held \u201cmore cash than all the other FTX debtor entities combined\u201d in its bankruptcy filings. The CFTC chair, committee chair Michigan Senator Debbie Stabenow and ranking member Arkansas Senator John Boozman pointed to the Digital Commodities Consumer Protection Act , or DCCPA, as a potential solution to the events leading up to FTX\u2019s insolvency, which left many U.S. consumers in the lurch. \u201cThe crypto industry lacks the customer protections that Americans expect and deserve,\u201d said Stabenow. \u201cWhen trading in U.S. markets, when exchanges accept customer funds for trading they must not be allowed to gamble with those funds [...] FTX did all of those things, emboldened by a lack of federal oversight.\u201d Related: US senators commit to advancing crypto bill despite FTX collapse Since filing for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 in the District of Delaware, FTX has been the target of global regulators and lawmakers investigating the exchange, including Turkey\u2019s Financial Crimes Investigation Agency, authorities in the Bahamas and U.S. state and federal authorities. The U.S. House Financial Services Committee scheduled a hearing to investigate the events around the collapse of the crypto exchange on Dec. 13, and the next court hearing in the bankruptcy case has been scheduled for Dec. 16.",

    "content": "Mazars\u2019 US division has long served as the accounting firm for former US President Donald Trump\u2019s company. Binance is collaborating with accounting firm Mazars as part of its proof-of-reserve (PoR) audits, which have been triggered by the fall of FTX. According to the Wall Street Journal, Mazars, the accounting firm that worked for former US President Donald Trump\u2019s company, has been appointed as an official auditor to conduct a \u201cthird party financial verification\u201d as part of Binance\u2019s PoR updates. According to a spokesperson for Binance, the accounting firm is already reviewing all of Binance\u2019s publicly shared information on Bitcoin BTC tickers down $16,986 PoR and will also be verifying future updates and tokens. \u201cThe first BTC verification update will be completed this week,\u201d said the representative. Mazars is a Paris-based international accounting firm. Mazars USA, Trump\u2019s longtime accounting firm, had been embroiled in a dispute with the House Oversight and Reform Committee over a request for some of Trump\u2019s financial records since 2019. According to reports, the firm will cut ties with Trump and his family in 2022. The announcement comes as Binance conducts PoR audits on large amounts of cryptocurrency. Binance sent 127,351 BTC, or approximately $2 billion, to an unknown wallet on November 28, with CEO Changpeng \u201cCZ\u201d Zhao later announcing that the transaction was part of the ongoing PoR process. The action has raised some eyebrows in the community, as CZ previously stated that it is bad news when exchanges must move large amounts of cryptocurrency to prove their wallet address. As previously reported, Binance launched a PoR process and mechanism in response to the FTX crypto exchange\u2019s crash and bankruptcy. On November 25, the company also released Merkle Tree-backed proof of funds for Bitcoin. Binance is not alone in making significant efforts to maintain customer trust in the aftermath of the FTX collapse, with many other exchanges, including OKX and KuCoin, rushing to release their PoR reports as well. Meanwhile, some industry observers believe that the current PoR process used by exchanges is largely ineffective unless they also provide liabilities that are difficult to forge.

    "description": "Many observers say the blank sheets represent everything protesters wish they could say but cannot.",
    "content": "A s protests against Xi Jinping\u2019s Zero-COVID policy spread across China\u2019s diverse cities and regions over the last week, one symbol remained constant: a blank sheet of paper. On a bridge in Beijing, dozens of protesters held sheets of blank paper aloft, as gridlocked cars below contributed toward a cacophony of horns\u2014described in captions on social media, where several videos of the event went viral, as expressions of support. And on a road in Shanghai that has become a symbolic center of the protest movement, police attempted to disperse hundreds of protesters on Sunday\u2014some of whom were holding blank sheets of paper, Reuters reported . China\u2019s first major protests in years began last week as an expression of dissent against China\u2019s strict zero-COVID policy, which has left the country oscillating through cycles of lockdowns even as much of the rest of the world returns to a semblance of normality. The spark appeared to be a fire in a tower block in the city of Urumqi, in the northwest Xinjiang region, which killed 10 people. The victims are rumored to have been unable to escape due to a strict COVID lockdown in which people were locked into their apartments, although the Chinese government denies this. The protests are the most sustained since the student protest movement of 1989 that was brutally suppressed when security forces massacred students at Tiananmen Square in Beijing, leaving hundreds or even thousands dead. Under President Xi, protests have become increasingly rare in China. His rule has been marked by an uptick in forms of social control like AI-enhanced surveillance and heavy police crackdowns on dissent. But already, the protests that began as dissent against Xi\u2019s zero-COVID policy appear to be morphing, at least for some, into a wider protest against authoritarianism. In Shanghai, a man holding a flower at a gathering of protesters was arrested by police after he questioned other arrests and referred to the fire in Urumqi. \u201cWe must be brave,\u201d the man could be heard telling the crowd in videos shared on social media, before being bundled into a vehicle. The blank sheet of paper has become so pervasive that, online, people have begun referring to the protests in China as the \u201cA4 revolution\u201d\u2014a reference to the standard paper size used in printers\u2014or \u201cwhite paper revolution.\u201d Many observers have described the paper as a representation of everything protesters wish they could say but cannot. It presents authorities with a difficult conundrum: arrest people for saying literally nothing at all or allow a simple act of resistance to proliferate unchallenged. In the social media age, the blank sheet has the added benefit of being difficult for online censors to quickly block at scale without accidentally censoring many other innocuous images or videos. Read More: Zero-COVID Protests in China Have Rattled Global Markets A global symbol against censorship The A4 sheet of paper has a longer history as a symbol of protest globally. Protesters in Hong Kong held up blank sheets of paper in 2020 in protest against the restrictive National Security Law that increased Beijing\u2019s power over the semi-autonomous enclave . In Russia earlier this year, protesters opposing the Kremlin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine were arrested for holding up blank sheets of paper amid a government crackdown on dissent. Those arrests only sparked further outrage online. The tactic was echoed by protesters in the U.K. demonstrating against a new draft law partially restricting the right to protest, drawing comparisons between the U.K. and more authoritarian states like Russia. The blank sheet of paper also confounds online censors in places like China and Russia, where online discussion is restricted. In China, where online censorship is especially sophisticated, social media platforms like WeChat, Weibo, and Douyin use a combination of human reviewers and AI to remove videos of protests. Access to the global internet beyond China\u2019s \u201cgreat firewall,\u201d where information about the protests is spreading more freely, is blocked. But by adopting previously benign items as their symbols, protesters reduce the applicability of AI systems, which can take engineers long amounts of time to adjust to reliably detect new symbols. Human censors must work overtime to fill the gap by removing photos and videos\u2014meaning there\u2019s a greater chance of some content slipping through and inspiring others. But like any potent form of political symbolism, the A4 sheet of paper might obscure as much as it reveals. \u201cThe demonstrators have broad slogans,\u201d tweeted Nathan Law, an activist who played a leading role in the 2019-2020 protest movement in Hong Kong, who is now living in self-imposed exile in London. Political opinion in China is varied, with many protesters clearly upset at zero-COVID policies but not necessarily the government as a whole. \u201cA blank sheet of paper with various expressions is unavoidable in this movement,\u201d Law wrote in a follow-up tweet . \u201cBecause the conditions for broad mass consensus \u2026 do not exist.\u201d \u2014 With additional reporting by Man Sum Lai.

    "description": "The fully-regulated NFT platform lets users buy NFT shares of a racehorse syndicate that maps to one horse, or a collection of horses.",
    "content": "The horse racing industry has ballooned to an astonishing $300 billion globally\u2014and now NFT-backed horse ownership platform Crown Ribbon is bringing that value onto the blockchain. Crown Ribbon enables users to buy and own NFT shares of a racehorse syndicate that maps to a specific horse, or to a collection of horses. The introduction of blockchain technology will increase efficiencies in the \u201cnotoriously slow and monotonous\u201d equine industry, according to a statement from Crown Ribbon accompanying its launch announcement. In particular, NFTs will enable holders to trace and transfer ownership and authentication rights over their shares easily, and bring these valuable assets on-chain. \u201cFor many racers, their horse is their most valuable possession, more valuable than their home and vehicles,\u201d said Doug Leonard, CEO of fixed-rate lending protocol Hifi , which has partnered with performance horse industry veteran Chad Beus to launch Crown Ribbon. \u201cTapping into that value through traditional means isn\u2019t an option.\u201d Crown Ribbon, Leonard added, is \u201cwell-positioned to disrupt this antiquated horse racing industry through blockchain technology, by offering a new ownership paradigm that comes with greater flexibility and tooling.\u201d Fully-regulated NFT ownership Crown Ribbon states that it is regulated and transparent, with the platform\u2019s offering qualified by the SEC under Regulation A+, making the platform compliant with SEC regulation for U.S. participants. And through Hifi\u2019s involvement with the platform, Crown Ribbon members will gain access to the lending protocol\u2019s ecosystem of liquidity products, a worldwide audience, and broader DeFi composability. \u201cEven for the best racing operations, traditional financial institutions lack the experience and expertise to underwrite these non-standard assets,\u201d said Leonard. \u201cBecause of our partnership with industry leaders at Crown Ribbon, Hifi gains access to the necessary experience and expertise to effectively underwrite these real world assets.\u201d To learn more about Crown Ribbon and its NFT-backed horses, visit www.crownribbon.io .

Speaking in an analysis video, AltcoinSherpa stated that in his opinion, the three tokens appear to be the best coins to hold in the long term. He also revealed his reasons for the stance for each of the tokens. He noted that the Apecoin token is a good prospect for placing a long trade as the ecosystem is preparing to introduce a new APE staking feature. \u201cYou can probably long until staking starts and then you can just short it,\u201d he added. For SUSHI, he pointed out that the token has been making nice moves lately despite the choppy trading conditions across the crypto market. Similarly, he maintains that LTC has been trading in pretty impressive regions. However, he conceded that the projection of tokens\u2019 potential to be profitable long trades is highly dependent on how Bitcoin (BTC) performs in the coming days. Reviewing BTC, he said that the benchmark crypto will likely regain ground early in December after its fast fall from around $21,000 in November when the FTX saga began. Meanwhile, he iterated that he does not expect BTC to springboard back to $20,000. \u201cBut maybe it goes like $18,000 or something like that. And then potentially new lows.

BTC has crossed the $17,000 mark for the first time in two weeks, currently trading at about $17,120, up 1.41 percent in the last 24 hours. The BTC recovery has also seen the total crypto market capitalization cross $900 billion again. Regardless, not all altcoins are yet to catch Bitcoin\u2019s bullish momentum. According to the latest price data, LTC, APE, and SUSHI are all trading in the red on the day. LTC is trading at around $77.26, down 1.20 percent in the last 24 hours. APE is trading at $3.97, down 2.39 percent, while SUSHI is trading at $1.39, down 0.51 percent in the last 24 hours.

    "description": "Kaunas, Lithuania, 1st December, 2022, ChainwireDappRadar, the global dapp store, said today in a report the blockchain gaming sector showed strong resilience throughout the month of November, despite negative pressure on the wider crypto industry that resulted from the collapse of the once-popular FTX cryptocurrency exchange. Blockchain games brought almost half of the blockchain activity DappRadar's latest Blockchain Games Report shows that blockchain gaming activity largely managed to brush off the events at FTX. The number of daily unique active wallets (UAW) averaged 800,875 in November, down slightly from just over 900,000 UAWs in the previous two months. All told, blockchain games accounted for a healthy 46% of all blockchain activity, ensuring it remains the biggest segment in the overall crypto space, ahead of decentralized finance. The most popular blockchain for gaming was, once again, Wax, which actually saw an increase in daily activity with an average of 344,284 daily UAWs in November, up more than 4% from October. BNB Chain was the second-most popular gaming protocol in October with an average of 171,269 dUAW but took a big hit in November and that number decreased by 35%. Taking BNB Chain\u2019s spot as the second-most popular gaming protocol in November was Hive, which also declined from the previous month by 8%, but maintained an average of 156,369 dUAW this month. \u00a0 There were a number of blockchains that suffered as a result of the fallout from the FTX collapse, though. In particular, gaming on the Solana blockchain - which was closely linked to FTX - appears to have taken a big hit.In November, it saw its gaming activity fall by a stunning 89.42% to just 2,326 daily UAWs, the lowest number it has registered thus far. Top-ranking games pick up speed while metaverses take a hit in sales Most of the games ranking in the top ten in terms of users put in a strong showing throughout the month. For instance, the Wax-based Alien Worlds managed to grow its user base by an impressive 25% to emerge as the most-played game of all, with 212,000 dUAWs. Splinterlands came in at number two with 169,000 dUAWs, up 5% from the previous month,\u00a0 November was a busy month for metaverse gamers too, with The Sandbox completing one of its most hyped events thus far, Alpha Season 3, with more than 353,000 unique users across 98 brand-generated experiences. While The Sandbox saw its NFT trading volume fall by around 33% last month to just over $1 million, it ended the month by announcing another big land sale. The upcoming sale promises to be a big event, with The Sandbox poised to auction off 1,967 LANDs, including 50 estates, 695 regular LANDs, 134 premium LANDs and 19 one-of-one LANDs. Both standard and premium LAND sales will be allocated via a blind ballot system. The sales actually kicked off on Nov. 24 and will continue until early in the New Year, so don't be surprised to see a significant uptick in The Sandbox's trading volume next month. Another popular metaverse, Decentraland, also witnessed a decline in November, with trading volume down 54% and sales down more than 23%. The decline in metaverse land sales is almost certainly a consequence of the goings on at FTX, which helped to accelerate a decline in land trading volume that began in July. It'll be interesting to see if the new LAND sale at The Sandbox can help to arrest the slide or not. Despite the decline in metaverse sales, the health of the blockchain gaming space looks positive overall, especially if the amount of cash being thrown at it from investors is anything to go by. The report notes that blockchain games and metaverse projects raised a combined $534 million in new funding throughout November. The highlight of the month was Web3 games publisher Fenix Games, which raised a hefty $150 million in the month to acquire, invest and distribute its portfolio of blockchain games. About DappRadar Founded in 2018, DappRadar is the The World's Dapp Store: a global decentralized applications (dapps) store, which makes it easy for its base of more than 1 million users per month to track, analyze, and discover dapp activity via its online platform.

    "content": ", the global dapp store, said today in a the blockchain gaming sector showed strong resilience throughout the month of November, despite negative pressure on the wider crypto industry that resulted from the collapse of the once-popular FTX cryptocurrency exchange. DappRadar's latest Blockchain Games Report shows that blockchain gaming activity largely managed to brush off the events at FTX. The number of daily unique active wallets (UAW) averaged 800,875 in November, down slightly from just over 900,000 UAWs in the previous two months. All told, blockchain games accounted for a healthy 46% of all blockchain activity, ensuring it remains the biggest segment in the overall crypto space, ahead of decentralized finance. The most popular blockchain for gaming was, once again, Wax, which actually saw an increase in daily activity with an average of 344,284 daily UAWs in November, up more than 4% from October. BNB Chain was the second-most popular gaming protocol in October with an average of 171,269 dUAW but took a big hit in November and that number decreased by 35%. Taking BNB Chain\u2019s spot as the second-most popular gaming protocol in November was Hive, which also declined from the previous month by 8%, but maintained an average of 156,369 dUAW this month. There were a number of blockchains that suffered as a result of the fallout from the FTX collapse, though. In particular, gaming on the Solana blockchain - which was closely linked to FTX - appears to have taken a big hit.In November, it saw its gaming activity fall by a stunning 89.42% to just 2,326 daily UAWs, the lowest number it has registered thus far. Most of the games ranking in the top ten in terms of users put in a strong showing throughout the month. For instance, the Wax-based Alien Worlds managed to grow its user base by an impressive 25% to emerge as the most-played game of all, with 212,000 dUAWs. Splinterlands came in at number two with 169,000 dUAWs, up 5% from the previous month, November was a busy month for metaverse gamers too, with The Sandbox completing one of its most hyped events thus far, Alpha Season 3, with more than 353,000 unique users across 98 brand-generated experiences. While The Sandbox saw its NFT trading volume fall by around 33% last month to just over $1 million, it ended the month by announcing another big land sale. The upcoming sale promises to be a big event, with The Sandbox poised to auction off 1,967 LANDs, including 50 estates, 695 regular LANDs, 134 premium LANDs and 19 one-of-one LANDs. Both standard and premium LAND sales will be allocated via a blind ballot system. The sales actually kicked off on Nov. 24 and will continue until early in the New Year, so don't be surprised to see a significant uptick in The Sandbox's trading volume next month. Another popular metaverse, Decentraland, also witnessed a decline in November, with trading volume down 54% and sales down more than 23%. The decline in metaverse land sales is almost certainly a consequence of the goings on at FTX, which helped to accelerate a decline in land trading volume that began in July. It'll be interesting to see if the new LAND sale at The Sandbox can help to arrest the slide or not. Despite the decline in metaverse sales, the health of the blockchain gaming space looks positive overall, especially if the amount of cash being thrown at it from investors is anything to go by. The report notes that blockchain games and metaverse projects raised a combined $534 million in new funding throughout November. The highlight of the month was Web3 games publisher Fenix Games, which raised a hefty $150 million in the month to acquire, invest and distribute its portfolio of blockchain games. Founded in 2018, is the The World's Dapp Store: a global decentralized applications (dapps) store, which makes it easy for its base of more than 1 million users per month to track, analyze, and discover dapp activity via its online platform. The platform currently hosts more than 12,000 dapps across 49 protocols and offers a plethora of consumer-friendly tools, including comprehensive NFT valuation, portfolio management, and daily industry-leading, actionable insight.

    "content": "Terra Luna Classic (LUNC) price has been sealed in a downward trend over the past few weeks amid a recoiling crypto market. Consequently, declined below the $0.00013 level during the second week of November. At its lowest point, LUNC dipped by almost 77% from its September high causing its market cap to plummet to around $970 million to position the token at #43 on CoinMarketCap\u2019s list of biggest cryptocurrencies. Terra\u2019s remnant, Terra Luna Classic, has become a famous crypto over the past few months despite the ecosystem\u2019s collapse in May. Notably, LUNC has done relatively better compared to the version supported by Do Kwon, Terra 2.0. Among the reasons behind Luna Classic\u2019s increasing popularity is the current burn rate where the tokens are placed in an inaccessible vault. Binance introduced a new 1.2% burn tax on LUNC tokens, pumping the price of Terra Luna Classic in September by 500%. More than 18.4 billion LUNC coins were burned in November alone, a significant increase from October\u2019s 18.3 billion and September\u2019s 4.2 billion burns. Another crucial catalyst for Terra Luna Classic is the increase in the number of addresses, rising to over 11,851 in November. This was higher compared to the 11,615 recorded in late October 2022. The upscale was significant given that the crypto market was in turmoil following the and its corporate sibling Alameda Research. In light of the recent FTX saga, the entire crypto market has suffered, leading to a plummeting LUNC price in the process. As shown on the daily chart (below), LUNC price has been on a downward trajectory recording lower lows and lower highs during mid-October and throughout November. The daily chart indicates a sizeable crash for LUNC price in November, before pulling back and forming a descending parallel pattern. In technical price analysis, this pattern is formed when an asset\u2019s price records a series of lower highs and lower lows over an extended period of time \u2013 usually more than two weeks. It is usually considered a significantly bearish technical formation over the longer term, showing that prices are in decline. LUNC price has dropped by almost 10% over the last 14 days, with all signs pointing to a continued downtrend despite the ongoing LUNC token burning. At the time of writing, LUNC is trading at $0.00016307 on , up by 0.4% over the last 24 hours but down by over 32% in the last 30 days. In the last 24 hours, LUNC has recorded trading volumes of over $66 million, which is lower compared to daily trades in the past month, such as November 17 when it recorded up to $159 million in intraday trading volume with signs of recovering from losses around FTX collapse. Terra Luna Classic price has moved below the 100-day and 50-day moving averages (MA), while the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator is moving below the neutral line, an indication that the the market still favours the downside. From the chart, there has not been much volatility in the last month. The relative strength index (RSI) plunged from 56 at the beginning of November, to reach 36 on December 1, 2022. During the past seven days, RSI has moved around 30 at the closing, a clear indication that bears may are still stronger that the bulls If the bears increase their supply, the LUNC price could continue plunging to break the support at $0.00015, embraced by the middle boundary of the falling channel. A drop further could see Terra\u2019s utilityt token declined toward the $0.00013 level embraced by the lower boundary of the prevailing chart pattern. Such a move would lead to 20.49% losses. On the other hand, if the bulls manage to sustain the support at $0.00015, they may push the price past the resistance at $0.000176, where the upper boundary of the descending parallel channel. The next possible target for LUNC price would be $0.000215, a 31% move upward. The recent LUNC dip is expected, given that not much development is happening within the ecosystem. Earlier in the year, the LUNC community considered reducing the supply to manage the epic drop in price, but this has not worked, as the amount being taken out of supply is low. In addition, that LUNC price is still plunging suggesting that the entire crypto market continues to suffer the aftermath of the FTX collapse, and adding this to the prolonged bear market, conditions remain blurry for when the whole market will recover. If you are considering ways to diversify your portfolio amid the current uncertainty in the crypto market, you should probably take a look at projects that are still budding so that you understand their fundamentals before diving in. Dash 2 Trade and IMPT are offering some of the best presales of the year, and have massive potential to deliver notable gains for early investors. stands among the most promising cryptocurrency projects to invest in now.

The native coin of the Dash 2 Trade platform is the D2T token. Users can use the D2T token to subscribe and gain access to the metrics of the platform\u2019s dashboard. The token is currently in the presale stage three, where a single D2T token is going for 0.0513 USDT. It is making desirable steps so far as 87.64% have already been sold. If you are looking for a crypto that is currently trending, D2T is the right choice and an amazing opportunity for early investors.

    "content": "Enlarge / You'll never see me coming... reader comments 35 with 0 posters participating Share this story Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Reddit Industry watchers who pay attention to Steam's Top Sellers charts may have noticed a surprising entry climbing near the top in recent days: a cosmetic Call of Duty skin pack themed after the Los Angeles Thieves Call of Duty League (CDL) team. Those surprisingly strong sales probably have little to do with team fandom, though, and more to do with how the nearly all-black kit can make players harder to spot in Modern Warfare II or Warzone 2.0 matches. The LA Thieves pack, which went on sale earlier this week, is one of 12 different themed skin packs designed around the 12 teams in the competitive CDL. But while every other available CDL skin pack features bright colors and/or a striped shoulder harness for easy visibility, the LA Thieves' offering is almost completely black, save for a small red \"LA\" logo on the chest, left arm, and back. Players have quickly noticed how this outfit could make them harder to see in the darker parts of some Call of Duty maps. \"Make sure you guys head to the store and pick up the only skin that gives you a competitive advantage,\" Thieves player Sam Larew cheekily tweeted on Tuesday. Wednesday morning, fan site CharlieIntel noticed the pack was the 11th bestselling item on all of Steam , as measured by total revenue. As of this writing, the $10 DLC still sits at the 18th position on Steam's US revenue charts , well ahead of popular games like Marvel Snap and Final Fantasy XIV . Enlarge / One of these things is not like the others... The next highest-selling CDL skin, the OpTic Texas pack , currently sits at 125th on an expanded list of Steam top sellers , suggesting it's not just demand for generic CDL skins driving those LA Thieves sales. \"I can assure you these Team Packs aren't usually very popular,\" says one writer at esports site EarlyGame . \"But the LA Thieves' kit is almost completely black, and it's becoming popular for all the wrong reasons... This is going to end well...\" Advertisement History repeating? Further Reading How \u201ccosmetic\u201d DLC became \u201cpay to win\u201d camouflage in some online shooters This isn't the first time the Call of Duty community has dealt with \"purely cosmetic\" DLC that provided players with a potential competitive advantage. In early 2021, Warzone players far and wide complained about the nearly all-black \"Roze\" skin , which was dominating tournaments and which at least one popular streamer said was \"ruining\" the game . After promising a fix in April, developer Raven Software finally made the Roze skin a bit brighter in a June 2021 game update. The skin had its brightness increased again, this time by 70 percent, in a May 2022 update that CharlieIntel said was \"meant to ensure that her outfit remains perfectly visible during intense gunfights.\" After just a few days of availability, the LA Thieves skin is already drawing plenty of Roze comparisons and complaints of \"Roze 2.0\" . One popular streamer even complained on Twitter that the new skin is \"somehow darker than Roze was in [ Warzone ].\" The LA Thieves \"knew what they were doing with this one,\" they added in a follow-up tweet . The LA Thieves CDL home variant for Modern Warfare 2 and Warzone 2 is SOMEHOW darker than Roze was in WZ1. pic.twitter.com/eruDswNZoK \u2014 ModernWarzone 2.0 (@ModernWarzone) November 29, 2022 Some players suggested that the improved lighting and lighter-colored desert maps in Warzone 2.0 mean an all-black skin will offer less of an advantage this time around. But that's far from a universal sentiment. \"The game is fast paced, anything that doesn't move is very difficult to identify as a threat except if it's very obvious,\" as one Redditor pointed out . \"If you're not wearing bright colors, it works.\" As eventually happened with Roze, Raven Software and Activision could once again nerf this new all-black skin to lessen its perceived visibility advantage in the game. But it seems unlikely that any such change will lead to refunds for all those players who are currently making the skin a surprise bestseller. As always, may the buyer beware.",

His comments suggest that Ethereum (ETH) could be a security. The CEO of Microstrategy, Michael Saylor, denoted this in a tweet citing Benham\u2019s remarks during an invitation-only crypto event at Princeton University. Saylor, an ardent Bitcoin maximalist, shared that the CFTC chair has now walked back on remarks he made in October when he suggested that Ether may also be a commodity. Today at Princeton, CFTC Chair Rostin Behnam said that the only cryptocurrency that should be viewed as a commodity is #Bitcoin , walking back from previous remarks made in October when he suggested Ether may also be a commodity. https://t.co/o5NrejDVaU \u2014 Michael Saylor\u26a1\ufe0f (@saylor) December 1, 2022 While speaking at the symposium hosted by Rutgers Law, Wall Street Blockchain Alliance, and Lowenstein Sandler in Manhattan at the time, Benham had stated that contrary to what its sister regulator\u2014the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)\u2014maintains, Ether is a commodity and should be regulated by his commission. Benham\u2019s latest stance on Ether possibly being a security would imply that the ETH market would be completely under the purview of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Meanwhile, during the Princeton presentation, Benham also asserted that the crypto market needs regulations now more than ever.

Benham defended the CFTC\u2019s actions towards the crypto market saying that the asset class is \u201cunlike any commodity we have dealt with.\u201d He added that the CFTC with its limited resources does not have the luxury of waiting for lawmakers and policymakers to provide clarity before acting. Meanwhile, he also rebuffed criticisms that the CFTC has faced for its connection with former FTX CEO , Sam Bankman-Fried, who allegedly donated thousands of dollars to the regulator. CFTC fighting for more crypto oversight powers The event is not the first time that Benham has called on law/policymakers to speed up regulatory clarity for digital assets. The CFTC chair has been calling for Congress to give the regular more oversight powers over certain cryptocurrencies, as well as increase the commission\u2019s budget to help it carry out its duties in the crypto market. Its push, which has received backing even from the SEC chair Gensler who recently stated that the CFTC should have oversight of stablecoins, has seen several bills introduced in Congress aimed at broadening the CFTC\u2019s jurisdiction. Back in September, a bill introduced by the leaders of the Senate Agriculture Committee, Chairwoman Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) and senior Republican, John Boozman (R-Ark.) took a procedural step towards being passed into law as Stacey Plaskett, a House of Representatives lawmaker, introduced a bill supporting the effort per coverage from Bloomberg.

    "content": "Photo by Markus Gilliar - GES Sportfoto/Getty Images The two stars faced each other at the World Cup Robert Lewandowski tried to shake Lionel Messi\u2019s hand, but the Argentine was not interested during his team\u2019s 2-0 victory over Poland at the FIFA World Cup. However, the two spoke after the match and seemed to be in good spirits. They embraced and shook hands on the pitch before going to their respective locker rooms. Messi himself was coy about what they spoke about. \u201cI was taught that everything that happens inside the pitch stays inside the pitch, and everything that happens in the locker room stays inside the locker room. I will not reveal anything about that interaction,\u201d Messi said. \"Me ense\u00f1aron que todo lo que pasa adentro de la cancha queda adentro de la cancha y todo lo que pasa en un vestuario queda adentro del vestuario. De m\u00ed no va a salir algo de la intimidad\". Messi, sobre su charla con Lewandowski. pic.twitter.com/sPUJpkqdKK\u2014 VarskySports (@VarskySports) November 30, 2022 Former Argentina and FC Barcelona striker Sergio Ag\u00fcero was also asked about the interaction. He is known as one of Messi\u2019s closest friends from their time together in the national team. Was there any conflict between the Polish star and the Argentine #10? \u201cNo, let\u2019s see. Sincerely, I\u2019ve not spoken to Messi about it. But in this match, Lewandowski fouled him. We all saw it. Lewy tried to shake his hand. But Messi was focused on the match,\u201d Ag\u00fcero replied. Is there something with Messi and Lewandowski?Kun Ag\u00fcero: No, let's see. Sincerely, I've not spoken to Messi about it. But in this match, Lewandowski fouled him. We all saw it. Lewy tried to shake his hand. But Messi was focused on the match.\u2014 Luis Mazariegos (@luism8989) December 1, 2022 A conflict between Lewandowski and Messi has been the subject of rumor for a while, although it\u2019s partially based on media outlets misinterpreting the Polish striker\u2019s statements.",

    "content": "The world\u2019s largest meme coin gets a boost from Twitter hype. XRP among coins delisted by Coinbase. FTM rallies on finances. Dogecoin was higher by almost 30% this week on increasing speculation that the meme coin could be used for Twitter payments. The cryptocurrency addition was mentioned during previously-leaked talks between new owner Elon Musk and its previous owners, but the platform recently paused work on a wallet. However, traders are still speculating that DOGE could be used at a later date. In a Sunday , Musk took to Twitter to share slides from an internal presentation. Named Unpacking \"Twitter 2.0,\" the billionaire shared some potential new changes. These included encrypted DMs and long-form tweets. The presentation also included a blank area for discussing payments, which led some to speculate that crypto will be back on the table soon. One drawback for Dogecoin could be its use of the Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus. The Tesla owner previously reversed a decision to accept Bitcoin as a payment option for the carmaker\u2019s vehicles over its energy usage. But Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin said in February this year that he would work with Dogecoin Foundation to help them follow Ethereum to the cleaner Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus. The price of DOGE was trading at the $0.1000 level on Thursday after the recent rally. Coinbase, the largest U.S.-based crypto exchange said this week that it would delist XRP, Bitcoin Cash, and Ethereum Classic from its crypto wallet. The exchange that the cryptocurrencies would no longer be supported on Coinbase Wallet from January \u201cdue to low usage,\u201d but users will be able to withdraw any unsupported assets with the wallet recovery phrase. XRP is still locked up in the long-running court battle with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The regulator claims that the coin should be classed as a security and accused its founders of profiting from an unregistered securities sale. On Wednesday, the SEC and defendants have been asked to file summary judgment reply briefs. The public can access redacted versions of these on December 5. The reply briefs are significant as Ripple could use the filing to push the SEC into a settlement. It means that we are likely to see the case drag into January at the earliest. The Ripple defense centers on statements from a previous director of the SEC. William Hinman said that Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) are not securities due to their decentralized nature. The SEC has tried to shield itself from those comments but they are likely to remain important to the final outcome. An SEC win has always been a headwind for the crypto industry which would then be faced to accept securities laws. The negative sentiment did not hurt XRP too badly, with the coin rising to $0.40 before finding resistance. Bitcoin was a meager 3.35% higher over the last seven days after the coin failed to find support. BTC was trading at $17,000 and was dragged lower by stocks and other assets after a hawkish speech from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. In a to the Brookings Institute, Powell said: \u201cWe think that slowing down at this point is a good way to balance the risks,\u201d Powell said. \u201cThe time for moderating the pace of rate increases may come as soon as the December meeting,\u201d set for Dec. 13-14. Although markets were boosted by prospects for a slower pace of interest rate hikes, he later added: For the medium term, investors will still look to higher-yielding assets and crypto will remain subdued. Fantom was the best-performing project with a 40% gain this week. The coin rebounded recently after distancing itself from the problems at FTX. Reports said that the Fantom Foundation generates consistent profits and has 30 years of income before it needs to sell any FTM tokens. The rally gained steam after Fantom Foundation\u2019s founder, Andre Cronje, the firm\u2019s financial records on November 28, revealing that it had $340 million worth of digital assets and had been earning over $10 million annually. \u201cMajor expenses include $3,000,000+ in listing fees for exchanges, $500,000+ \u2018sponsorship fees\u2019 for \u2018influencers\u2019. We decided to never pay for exchange listings or influencers again. Fantom becomes incredibly frugal. Complete marketing freeze. Hiring only essential staff.\u201d The FTM token was trading at $0.260 after the recent rally and is ranked number 59 in the list of coins by market cap.",

That day, Assassin's Creed Valhalla players will be able to purchase a character pack based on the shooter, which will include swords, armor sets, a mount skin, and a scout skin. Meanwhile, Destiny 2 players will be able to get a ship, Sparrow, Ghost, finisher cosmetics, and three armor ornament sets based on the Ubisoft game. Destiny 2 will also offer a weapons pack with \"four unique spins\" on the game's subclasses. Images of some of these new skins and designs can be found in the Tweet embedded below. The worlds of Assassin's creed and Destiny are about to collide.Assassin's Creed Valhalla and Destiny 2 Crossover Cosmetics: available December 6.#AssassinsCreed #LeapIntoTheLight-- Assassin's Creed (@assassinscreed) December 1, 2022 All in all, this seems like a strange concept for a crossover, but it will add some really unique designs to both Destiny 2 and Assassin's Creed Valhalla! Naturally, fans of both franchises have strong opinions about these designs. Generally, it seems that Destiny 2 fans are digging the Assassin's Creed Valhalla crossover, as the designs still feel true to Bungie's game. However, a lot of Assassin's Creed fans seem to think that the Destiny-inspired skins don't feel authentic to the Ubisoft series. At the end of the day, it's important to remember that this is just extra content, and players can decide for themselves whether any of it is worth purchasing! Crossover content isn't meant to be taken as part of any kind of official canon, and it can be easily ignored by those that choose to do so. Crossovers like this are becoming increasingly common in the video game industry, and sometimes the results don't gel perfectly! Destiny 2 and Assassin's Creed Valhalla are both available on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. Readers can check out all of our previous coverage for Destiny 2 right here and Assassin's Creed Valhalla right here. {replyCount}commentsAre you looking forward to this crossover content?

Co-stars on the series include Sam Richardson, Cecily Strong, Vanessa Bayer, Tim Heidecker, Steven Yeun, Paul Walter-Hauser and Bob Odenkirk. The first two seasons have become cult classics among fans, spawning original characterss including Bart Harley Jarvis, Karl Havoc, Car Focus Group Guy, Chunky, and the \"We're all trying to find the guy who did this\" Hot Dog Guy. The series was renewed for a third season earlier this year.\"Zach [Kanin] and I just found ourselves writing a lot of scenes like that, where the person is refusing to admit they've done something wrong, or lying, and will do anything to cover that up,\" Robinson previously told GQ. \"So it became the theme of the whole show because we kept gravitating towards writing those scenes.\"Will Detroiters come back?Another show involving Robinson, Kanin, and Richardson that has a special place in fans' hearts is Detroiters, \"A hundred percent, we'd want to go back,\" Richardson shared with ComicBook.com. \"I love Detroiters so much, and there was so much more that we want to do with it. So we've gotten ... I think it got clipped off the tree before it was fully, fully bare. I love and I am very proud of those first two seasons, but I'm also curious to what we would have done had we done more, and we still want to do more.\"\"We text each other, the creators, me, Tim, Joe [Kelly], and Zach [Kanin], we text each other plot points, pitches still,\" Richardson continued. \"Even if it's just for us to laugh about, we'll like text out ... [I don't want to] give those away, because who knows if we do come back, I don't want to burn a hilarious thing. We'll send it back and then we'll just start to stockpile and it kind of just snowballs and we come up with these episodes.

    "content": "The new Willow series debuted its first two episodes yesterday, and they feature the return of the 1988's film's Warwick Davis (Willow) and Joanne Whalley (Sorsha). In the original film, Willow teams up with some unlikely new friends in order to protect Elora Danan, a baby who was prophesied to bring down the evil Queen Bavmorda and become the empress of Tir Asleen, Galladoorn, Nockmaar, and Cashmere. The new series takes place many years later, and it's revealed in the beginning of the first episode that Elora had been hidden away for her own protection, and doesn't even know her own identity. However, her true self is revealed at the end of the first episode when she comes face to face with her old protector, Willow. Warning: Spoilers Ahead! Elora is first introduced as Dove (Ellie Bamber) who works in the kitchens at the Tir Asleen castle. She falls in love with Airk (Dempsey Byrk), the son of Sorsha and Madmartigen (Val Kilmer, who does not appear in the new show). When Airk is kidnapped, Dove secretly follows the team assembled to find him, which includes Airk's sister, Kit (Ruby Cruz). Upon meeting Willow at the end of the episode, the Nelwyn sorcerer uncovers the birthmark on her arm, proving her identity. In the second episode, Willow attempts to teach Elora magic, but the young apprentice seems hopeless. However, the very end of the episode teases her magical promise, which will have any Willow film fan excited about the character's future. Is Madmartigen Part of the Willow Series?While Val Kilmer was unable to return to play Madmartigen, Bryk and Cruz both capture the star's essence while playing his twin children. Recently, the duo had a chat with ComicBook.com's Chris Killian, and he asked if there was anything from Kilmer's performance in the original film that they tried to \"latch on to\" in order to \"make it feel more believable\" that they were the children of Madmartigan.\"Yeah, absolutely,\" Bryk replied. \"Definitely,\" Cruz agreed. \"Yeah, I think having access to that character was so helpful because we could sort of envision or imagine, we didn't have to imagine who he was, but then we could imagine how he was as a parent, which was really fun ... What we would admire, what we would reject, and I mean... I don't know how much we can spoil.\" Cruz then whispered something to Bryk and he replied, \"Yeah, I think that's probably fine.\" Cruz continued, \"Yeah, and sort of the absence of him was really interesting and sort of allowing our characters to - I actually don't want to spoil.\" Bryk added, \"It's also, you see their energy and that's your parent, so you kind of subconsciously let it filter in. I think the most conscious way ... I know for me personally, there were certain action moves or sword moves that were almost exact parallels. Little easter eggs that I'm curious to see if people will pick up on.\"{replyCount}commentsThe first two episodes of Willow are now streaming on Disney+.",

    "content": "It would appear God of War exists within the Marvel Cinematic Universe now. God of War is one of the biggest gaming franchises out there and is largely a result of the 2018 soft-reboot. Although it certainly had its time to shine on PS2 and PS3, many grew out of it as the franchise reflected a much more angsty and slightly immature side of the industry. They're fun games and still have a lot of value, but as time went on, the standards changed and more was demanded from games. The 2018 entry was a massive shake-up as it focused more on giving depth to Kratos and questioning is past behavior, offering a more mature take on the beloved franchise. The latest entry, God of War Ragnarok, is PlayStation's fastest selling first-party game of all-time which speaks volumes about its reach.It also seems that God of War has gained so much notoriety that it gained some recognition in the MCU. In the Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special that was recently released on Disney+, the franchise was name dropped. After Drax and Mantis land on Earth, they go to the Hollywood Walk of Fame and see a bunch of people dressed up as the Avengers, celebrities, and characters from other franchises. A family runs up to take a picture with Drax and Mantis, thinking they're also cosplayers, and a woman says \"I got a picture with the God of War!\" God of War reference in The Guardian's of the Galaxy Holiday Special from GodofWar Of course, they don't specifically name Kratos, but Drax does have the very general design of the character given he's bald, muscular, shirtless, and covered in scars and marks. It's also worth noting that Drax actor Dave Bautista has expressed interest in playing Kratos in Amazon's live-action adaptation of God of War. It's unclear if this will come to fruition, but Bautista has also been campaigning to star in Netflix's live action adaptation of Gears of War, an Xbox shooter franchise.What do you think of God of War being namedropped in the MCU?

    "content": "A new update about the Metal Gear Solid franchise is bad news for the long-running but increasingly dormant Konami IP. The update comes from the creator of the series, Hideo Kojima. As you may know, Kojima parted ways with Konami in 2015 after 29 years with the company. During this time he most notably created Metal Gear Solid. And if you're familiar with the split, you'll know it was a messy end to the relationship. Despite this, there have been rumors here and there claiming the pair have mended the relationship. On the back of this claim, the rumors vary, but there's no need to worry about the splintering claims because the foundation of the rumors isn't true. Speaking on his Brain Structure podcast, Kojima noted he's heard the requests of fans to return to work on Metal Gear Solid and other franchises he worked on when he was at Konami. That said, it's not happening. This is what Kojima specifically had to say about these requests: \"I take this as a positive thing, but also, as adults, everyone should know that this isn't going to happen.\" Of course, in the past Kojima said Metal Gear Solid V was going to be the last Metal Gear Solid game, and then once he left Konami, the nail only got hit deeper into the coffin. Yet, there's been rumors to the contrary but now we know there's nothing to these rumors. Konami could continue the series in the future, but it won't be with Kojima, and if Kojima isn't involved, it's not really Metal Gear Solid, is it?Obviously, things can always change, but it's hard to see Kojima changing his mind at this point. If he was going to work on Metal Gear Solid again, he probably would have by now. He's been clear he wants to work on new things, including movies. To go back to the Konami franchise would conflict with everything he's been saying lately, but if you were holding onto a glimmer of hope, it sounds like it's time to finally let it go.{replyCount}commentsH/T.

    "content": "Turn up the Awesome Mix: it's time to face the music in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3. Set to the tune of Spacehog's \"In the Meantime,\" the first trailer for the third and final installment of James Gunn's cosmic trilogy was released Thursday during Brazil's Comic Con Experience in S?o Paulo. Along with the return of the 2014 alternate timeline version of Gamora (Zoe Saldana) -- not seen since 2019's Avengers: Endgame -- the footage showed New Men creator the High Evolutionary (Chukwudi Iwuji) and the all-gold cosmic crusader Adam Warlock (Will Poulter). It also featured an Easter egg callback to 2014's original Guardians of the Galaxy. The trailer starts with a stylized version of the Marvel Studios logo as it transforms into Peter Quill's (Chris Pratt) tape deck. The logo resembles the red-and-white-striped sticker label of Awesome Mix Vol. 1 and Awesome Mix Vol. 2, the cassette mix tapes gifted to Peter by his late mother, Meredith Quill (Laura Haddock).After classic tracks like Redbone's \"Come and Get Your Love\" on Vol. 1 and Fleetwood Mac's \"The Chain\" on Vol. 2, the Vol. 3 soundtrack will look a little different: at the end of Vol. 2, Peter inherited a Zune MP3 player with 300 songs, one last gift from adoptive father Yondu (Michael Rooker). Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 Soundtrack In 2020, Gunn shared \"Meredith Quill's Complete Awesome Mix,\" a curated Spotify \"master list of Meredith Quill's favorite songs\" that Gunn considered for the Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 1 and 2 soundtracks. \"I'm not promising I won't use these in future films, but I feel we could all deal with a little joy during our time in quarantine,\" Gunn wrote of the 64-song playlist, which includes tracks like \"You Make Me Feel Like Dancing\" by Leo Sayer, \"She's Gone\" by Hall & Oates, and \"Renegade\" by Styx. So far, Vol. 3 tracks include a remixed version of the 1996 song \"In the Meantime\" by Spacehog and the 2002 song \"Do You Realize??\" by The Flaming Lips. The latter featured in the San Diego Comic-Con trailer that was made exclusively for the convention crowd. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 Cast and Synopsis In Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3, our beloved band of misfits are looking a bit different these days. Still reeling from the loss of Gamora, Peter Quill must rally his team around him to defend the universe and protect one of their own. A mission that, if not completed successfully, could quite possibly lead to the end of the Guardians as we know them.James Gunn writes and directs Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3, which stars Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista, Karen Gillan, Pom Klementieff, featuring Vin Diesel as Groot, Bradley Cooper as Rocket, Sean Gunn, Chukwudi Iwuji, Will Poulter and Maria Bakalova. Kevin Feige is the producer and Louis D'Esposito, Victoria Alonso, Nikolas Korda, Simon Hatt, and Sara Smith serve as executive producers.{replyCount}commentsMarvel Studios' Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 opens only in theaters on May 5th, 2023.",

    "content": "Many people are willing to work harder to steal money than they would ever have to work to earn it. Moreover, the penalties for being caught stealing money far outweigh the potential benefits of getting away with it. And yet, scammers continue to scam wherever they see an opening. Debt relief, populated as it is with people anxiously seeking solutions to debt problems, is often seen as fertile ground for these bad actors. With that in mind, here\u2019s some advice for avoiding debt relief scams. When it Sounds Too Good to Be True \u201cWe guarantee we can help you pay off all of your debts for pennies on the dollar!\u201c That\u2019s a tough idea to resist when your ends are so far apart they aren\u2019t even speaking the same language. You\u2019ll need to muster up the wherewithal to resist that siren song though, lest you get taken for a very expensive ride. Legitimate debt relief companies are prohibited by law from guaranteeing they can get you a debt settlement deal with your creditors. Further, debt settlement only works on specific types of unsecured debt. Child support, alimony, car loans, home loans and federal student debt are immune to debt settlement. What\u2019s more, some creditors will refuse to accept debt settlement agreements altogether, so there\u2019s no way anyone can guarantee your eligible debts can be settled\u2014let alone the ineligible ones. \u201cWe\u2019ll Go To Work As Soon as You Pay the Settlement Fee\u201d The law also prohibits debt settlement companies from charging you upfront settlement fees. They can only request payment for services rendered after the services have been rendered. In other words, they have to negotiate an agreement with one of your creditors, get your approval of that agreement, then disburse whatever that agreement requires\u2014 before they can invoice you for that work. Yes, debt relief companies are allowed to impose a small signup fee and minimal monthly service charges. However, these typically only run in the neighborhood of $9.95. Meanwhile, settlement fees typically run between 15% and 25% of the amount of debt settled on your behalf. Anyone asking for that money up front is operating in violation of the law. \u201cYou Can Stop Communicating With Your Creditors Now\u201d Scammers advise marks to stop talking to creditors\u2014they\u2019ll take over from there on out. The problem with that is you\u2019ll never know if they even got in touch with your creditors. You\u2019re happily sending the scammers money to \u201csettle your debts, \u201c while your creditors have no idea you\u2019ve \u201cenrolled\u201d in a debt relief program. By the time you figure out what\u2019s going on, you could be many, many thousands of dollars deeper in debt, and the nefarious individuals have taken your money and disappeared. \u201cDon\u2019t Worry About the Details, We\u2019ll Take Care of Everything\u201d Ahhhhhhh, but the devil \u2014 as the old saying goes \u2014 is in the details. Scammers gloss over them because many aspects of the debt relief process can be off-putting at first glance. For example: \u2022 The forgiven amount of your debt might be subject to taxation by the IRS. \u2022 The debt relief process will have a negative impact on your credit score. \u2022 The process can take anywhere from two to five years to complete, depending upon the amount of debt you have, how many debts you have and with what entities those debts reside. \u2022 There are no guarantees the process will work, because settlement agreements are predicated upon getting buy-in from creditors. Any company rushing you to sign up before demonstrating crystalline transparency about those details should be avoided. In fact, that information should be conveyed before they look over your finances to see if you\u2019re even a viable candidate. The people with whom you\u2019ve been speaking did look over your finances before asking you to sign up\u2014right? That\u2019s one of the hallmarks of the validity of Freedom Debt Relief and other legitimate operators in this space. Scammers don\u2019t bother with that step, nor do they discuss credit card payment strategies with you firstbecause they have no intention of doing anything about your debt. The Bottom Line This brings us back to our first point of advice for avoiding debt relief scams. If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. It is impossible to overstress the importance of conducting due diligence on any debt relief firm with which you\u2019re considering contracting. Run their name past the Better Business Bureau. Check them out with the Office of the Attorney General in your state. Look to see if the American Fair Credit Council accredits them. The money you save will most assuredly be your own.",

    "description": "Amid rising hate crime, America still can\u2019t decide how bigotry and health fit together, and the debate has major legal implications",
    "content": "Everyone knows that Law & Order plotlines are often, as they say, ripped from the headlines. But Dr. Alvin Poussaint, 88, knows this on another level: An emeritus professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, he has had the unusual experience of seeing his ideas incorporated into a season 12 episode of the long-running show. In it, a white working stiff murders a Black CEO in a dispute over a New York City taxicab. When the trial begins, a respected Black psychiatrist takes the stand to present his idea that the defendant suffers from \u201cextreme racism,\u201d a mental illness. His lawyers argue that extreme racism has such a complete hold on the defendant that it mitigates their client\u2019s legal responsibility for the murder. In the final moments, the audience is encouraged to feel that it\u2019s a victory for justice, for law and order, when the jury rejects the psychiatrist\u2019s ideas, Poussaint tells me with a tinge of disdain. [time-brightcove not-tgx=\u201dtrue\u201d] In the real world, Poussaint was that psychiatrist. Sort of. While he never brought his ideas to the witness stand inside the New York City courthouse behind those massive stone steps that Law & Order made famous, in 1999 he shared his theories on the link between mental health and extreme forms of bigotry on the op-ed pages of the New York Times. In doing so, he helped set off a debate that ended with the American psychiatric establishment publicly rejecting the concept\u2014partly on the grounds that so many people are racists. But even now, after nearly a decade during which the number of hate crimes has steadily increased, the question of the relationship between bigotry and mental illness has never fully been resolved. In fact, recent high-profile incidents have made public perception of that dynamic perhaps as muddled as ever. The issue comes up in relation to everything from major mass shootings to pop-culture discourse. The racist attack at a Buffalo, N.Y., supermarket, for which the gunman pleaded guilty this week to state murder and domestic terrorism charges, prompted calls for the country to \u201cget serious about mental health\u201d as well as pleas not to talk about the shooting as a matter of psychiatric illness rather than a racist hate crime. Read more: Anti-Black Violence Has Long Been the Most Common American Hate Crime\u2014And We Still Don\u2019t Know the Full Extent It\u2019s hard to distinguish what psychiatric experts have decided not to define, to separate what Poussaint calls \u201ceveryday racism\u201d\u2014covering the span from systemic discrimination to microaggressions\u2014from the extreme version, which he and others have described as the point at which bigotry so deeply shapes behavior that a person struggles to function and sometimes becomes dangerous. But the question is more than just a thought experiment. If extreme racism were to become accepted as a mental illness per se, more suspects in hate-crime cases could potentially have recourse to mount \u201cinsanity\u201d defenses in court. And given all the mass shootings and disturbing public events in which extreme racism appears to have played some part since Poussaint first described his ideas, it\u2019s also hard not to wonder. Might developing a research-backed extreme-racism diagnosis\u2014and sound treatments\u2014have saved lives? Joshua Bessex\u2014APA memorial outside the Tops Friendly Market after a mass shooting in Buffalo, N.Y., is seen July 14, 2022. Though the FBI typically releases data each fall detailing the prior year\u2019s hate-crimes statistics, the agency has not yet done so in 2022. But social conditions are rife, experts say, for the increase to continue. (In 2020, the most recent year for which FBI data is available, the agency reported 8,263 incidents\u2014an increase of nearly a thousand over the prior year, despite 452 fewer agencies reporting\u2014and most experts believe the real number is higher.) Police have noted that 47 out of 100 people arrested for hate crimes in New York City in early 2022 \u201chave prior documentation of an [emotionally disturbed person] incident.\u201d So the stakes are high for the nation\u2019s courtrooms to respond to the trauma unleashed by that dynamic\u2014and for Americans to decide what constitutes a just outcome. \u201cIt\u2019s complicated,\u201d says Sander Gilman, a historian at Emory University who researches the relationship between health, science, law, and society, and who has long taught a course on extremism. \u201cBut I\u2019m going to start with two things that I call Gilman\u2019s Law: not all racists are crazy, but crazy people can be racists.\u201d Thanks in part to the influence of pop culture\u2014not least those TV police procedurals\u2014many assume that insanity pleas are common. In reality, mental-health defenses are rare, and even more rarely lead to reduced punishment. Mounting that kind of defense requires time and significant resources to gather evidence and expert testimony, so in practice it is not an avenue available to all defendants. In England and the U.S., courts began to reliably consider the mental health of defendants only in the 19th century. The M\u2019Naghten rule, a standard for determining a defendant\u2019s sanity at the time of a crime, was established in 1840s England. It holds that only the sane can be held responsible for their actions. As a result, the question of mental fitness\u2014sufficient sanity to participate meaningfully in one\u2019s own defense\u2014is sometimes evaluated before a trial. (Whether the state has an obligation or right to treat such an illness in order for the person to then stand trial is, Gilman says, a question that goes back as far as the idea of such a defense.) Once a competency decision has been made, the accused who do go to trial have the right to a defense. In some cases, that may include an option for a jury to find the defendant not guilty by reason of mental disorder. In others, ideas about the mental health of the defendant may more informally shape what evidence is presented. But so-called \u201cmental disease or defect\u201d defenses are used in only about 1% of cases, says Michael Boucai, a professor at the State University of New York at Buffalo School of Law and an expert on mental health and other social issues in courtrooms. Those defenses are successful in even fewer cases; in fact, such a tactic often backfires or results in a defendant confined for a longer term inside a hospital than that person would have spent in prison, sometimes with no end date. And even rarer\u2014though not unheard of\u2014is an attempt to use racism or other bigotry as an indicator of mental-health challenges, he says. \u201cI think it would be extremely hard,\u201d says Boucai, \u201cI mean extremely hard, to succeed on the theory that extreme racism per se\u2014particularly subscription to a theory\u2014is a mental illness for the purpose of criminal responsibility. Just because you have a psychologist or psychiatrist saying this person is mentally ill does not mean the law has to [accept] that.\u201d (Nor does the defendant: Dylann Roof, the white man who shot and killed nine Black worshippers inside a Charleston, S.C., church in 2015\u2014whose legal team used words like \u201cdelusional,\u201d \u201cabnormal,\u201d and \u201csuicidal\u201d to describe their client\u2014rejected advice from his lawyers to attempt to avoid the death penalty by allowing them to argue that he was insane or suffering from a mental defect at the time of the shooting.) Stephen B. Morton\u2014APA crowd prays outside the Emanuel AME Church after a memorial service for the nine people killed in a racist attack at the church in Charleston, S.C., June 19, 2015. Some fear that raising mental-health issues in court runs the risk of bolstering inaccurate myths about the mentally ill. In reality, mentally ill people are disproportionately more likely to become the victims of crime, and most do nothing to victimize others. And, as has been observed after so many headlinemaking crimes, suspects from privileged groups are more likely to have their actions described as illness in need of treatment instead of criminal evil meriting punishment. Some experts fear that shifting the conversation to questions of mental health can also draw attention away from hateful ideas embraced by the person accused of the crime\u2014ideas that are today often shared by people, including public figures, whose mental health is not questioned. That\u2019s how important social problems that require the nation\u2019s attention are transformed into one individual\u2019s medical problems, says W. Carson Byrd, a sociologist at the University of Michigan. Column: We Need to Take Action to Address the Mental Health Crisis in This Pandemic That line of thinking is particularly problematic in a culture prone to dismiss the need for systemwide reforms to address inequality, Byrd says. It can foster an emphasis on quick fixes for the world\u2019s long-standing problems with bigotry. (In 2012, for example, a team of British researchers announced that an existing heart and blood-pressure drug appeared to reduce implicit bias after a study involving just 36 subjects.) \u201cWhite supremacy is a very normal part of society,\u201d says Byrd, who is also the faculty director of research initiatives at his university\u2019s National Center for Institutional Diversity. It is not a good or productive part of society, he points out, but a deeply entrenched one. \u201cOne of the detriments of trying to look at racism as a form of psychopathology or mental illness is that it makes that [illness] abhorrent, as if everything else is working in a certain [non-racist] way.\u201d Research has also long shown that bigotry is not an inborn human trait, but rather something learned from our environments, Byrd says. While racism can influence one\u2019s mental health, describing racism itself\u2014even \u201cextreme racism\u201d\u2014as a mental illness implies that bigotry exists beyond our individual and collective control. \u201cBy medicalizing [extreme racism], making it something curable, a mental-health disorder, it pulls away from having those broader conversations about how society is impacting people,\u201d he says. \u201cWe just try to figure out, \u2018How do we fix this one person?\u2019\u201d This problem, Boucai notes, can already be clearly seen in discussions about gun crime, and mass shootings in particular: \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to understand these crimes and the discourse of insanity provides one way to do it,\u201d says Boucai. \u201cBut I think we can see where that sort of language is irresponsible and potentially undermines a just result.\u201d In other words, if a mass shooter is simply insane, then wholesale gun-law reform can, to some, seem unnecessary, even unwise. When bigotry is involved, that supposed insanity might, some who oppose Poussaint\u2019s ideas believe, undermine systemwide efforts toward equity\u2014or at least toward greater safety for those most likely to be targeted. In 1999, when Poussaint wrote his op-ed advocating for increased research into possible psychiatric treatments for extreme racism, he was the author of acclaimed books about the effects of racism on Black mental health and a veteran of public controversy. Years earlier he\u2019d argued publicly that racial pride among Black Americans could be taken to an unhealthy extreme. By the 1990s, he may have been best known for his work with Bill Cosby, consulting on scripts for The Cosby Show in a massively popular effort to disrupt stereotypes. Poussaint first published his ideas about extreme racism weeks after a man named Buford O. Furrow Jr. shot and seriously injured four children and an adult inside a Jewish Community Center in Los Angeles, then shot and killed a nearby Asian-American postal worker. When captured and ultimately convicted, Furrow told investigators his actions had been motivated by hate. Reporters unearthed information indicating that Furrow had close relationships with known white nationalists, and also that he had been evaluated by Washington State\u2019s mental-health system only months before the attack. He\u2019d even told officials after a previous arrest for assault that he\u2019d \u201cfantasized,\u201d about mass murder. To Poussaint, this story signaled a growing threat posed by a failure to recognize that, while highlighting and combating systemic racism is important in preventing discrimination, so is identifying and helping individuals motivated by bigotry who might go so far as to injure or kill others.

In 1993, a Jamaican immigrant named Colin Ferguson had shot and killed six people and injured 19 aboard a New York commuter train after years of personal struggles that he blamed on white and Asian people, whom he referred to as \u201cdevils.\u201d Ferguson had been pinned down by passengers on the train to stop the shooting but, while defending himself at trial, he argued that someone else committed the crime. (Ferguson\u2019s lawyers had planned to argue that he was insane at the time, suffering from something called \u201cBlack rage,\u201d another condition debated but not officially recognized by the American Psychiatric Association and that was the subject of a Law & Order episode.) After the train shootings, Poussaint\u2014a Haitian-American son of immigrants\u2014had noted Ferguson\u2019s trajectory: racist thinking, delusions that had come to dominate his life, then mass violence. This was a textbook case of extreme racism. Alan Raia\u2014Newsday RM/Getty ImagesTrain passengers are treated on the platform after Colin Ferguson opened fire on the train as it arrived at Garden City, N.Y., on December 7, 1993. \u201cExtreme racism crosses the line and is out of control,\u201d he explains. \u201cJust like somebody can have a little bit of anxiety, but if they have anxiety to the point that it is immobilizing, then it is a mental disorder.\u201d Mass shooters behind hate crimes are, as he sees it, in a similar state: \u201c[They] weren\u2019t functioning individuals. They were impaired by their mental pathology.\u201d When the third edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), the guide that mental-health professionals use to make their diagnoses, was published in 1980, clinicians like Poussaint considered racism\u2014not extreme racism, but what he calls everyday racism\u2014a potential symptom of several conditions, from paranoid personality disorder to generalized anxiety disorder. Racism alone is not sufficient to diagnose a patient with one of those conditions, but an extreme racist, Poussaint says, likely suffers from delusions. Such people live with multiple symptoms including paranoia; they are likely to project negative traits or outcomes onto entire groups and sustain those beliefs even in the face of strong countervailing evidence. Many embrace conspiracy theories. Some may grow violent. In fact, Poussaint argued in a 2002 Western Journal of Medicine article, the extreme racist often begins with \u201cverbal expression of antagonism, progresses to avoidance of members of disliked groups, then to active discrimination against them, to physical attack, and finally to extermination (lynchings, massacres, genocide). That fifth point on the scale, the acting out of extermination fantasies, is readily classifiable as delusional behavior.\u201d Poussaint was not the first person to raise the idea that extreme racism is itself a mental illness. But he was among those leading the call for the American Psychiatric Association, publishers of the DSM, to consider putting it in subsequent editions of the manual, which has a long history of evolving, often slowly, in response to research and norms. When his op-ed ran, it seemed to Poussaint, people pounced. Some of his fellow Black psychiatrists argued that such a diagnosis would unleash a wave of legal excuse-making, helping no one but the violent racists themselves. Poussaint counters that other health diagnoses have yet\u2014nearly 200 years after psychological concerns officially entered American courtrooms\u2014to produce rafts of acquittals. And some clinicians and researchers argued that there are other ways of attacking racism besides treating it as an illness\u2014educational programs, diversity initiatives, policy changes. That\u2019s a point Poussaint says he doesn\u2019t oppose, at least when it comes to everyday racism. Those steps can help racists who embrace repugnant ideas while remaining functional parts of society. But those aren\u2019t the people he\u2019s talking about. \u201cRacism negatively impacts public health,\u201d the American Psychiatric Association told TIME in a statement. \u201cThe American Psychiatric Association has been focusing on this in the DSM by identifying and addressing the impact of structural racism on the over- or underdiagnosis of mental disorders in certain ethno-racial groups. From time to time we have received proposals to create a diagnosis of extreme racism but they have not met the criteria identified for creating new disorders.\u201d To this day, Poussaint believes that extreme racism is very likely its own disorder in need of study, possible diagnostic criteria, and evidence-based treatment, he told me in September from his home in Massachusetts. But after retiring about 2\u00bd years ago at the age of 86, he says he\u2019s too far out of the professional mix to continue to push for an extreme racism diagnosis. I ask Poussaint what he thinks might have happened if extreme racism had become its own diagnosable condition listed in the DSM. Extreme racism might have been a topic on talk shows and a more frequent topic of news coverage, he says. With research and public information campaigns, the need for intervention could have been as clear as it is for heart attacks; the steps to do so as well-known as CPR. \u201cWe\u2019d get away from treating it as if [extreme racism] is normative,\u201d Poussaint says, \u201clike a cultural difference because America is a racist country. We have made it normative by not calling it what it is. Even people in general society, friends and relatives and even the afflicted individual, would recognize it as a disorder and say, \u2018I\u2019m not alright.\u2019 People who get swept up by anxiety and can\u2019t function, they don\u2019t think they are normal. They say, \u2018This is taking over my life. I need some help.\u2019 [A diagnosis] clues the family to say, \u2018This person is really troubled and we have to get them some help.\u2019\u201d \u2014with reporting by Solcyre Burga, Mariah Espada and Simmone Shah",
