    "description": "An interview with the outgoing House Speaker",
    "content": "Ever since the election, Nancy Pelosi says, congressional Democrats have been begging her to remain as their leader. Of course, she knew what they were really doing: currying favor, just in case. \u201cOur members were just exploding my phone to stay,\u201d she says, \u201cwhich is a nice thing, because if I don\u2019t stay, then they\u2019ve gotten the points for saying \u2019stay,\u2019 and if I do\u2014\u201c she trailed off, laughing. No matter what she decided, they knew it would be in their interest to be on her good side going forward. For two decades, it has been in every congressional Democrat\u2019s interest to stay in Pelosi\u2019s good graces. Since winning her first leadership position in 2001, she has ruled the House Democratic caucus with an iron fist and a velvet glove, keeping her fractious party in near-lockstep during historically tumultuous times. From the Iraq War to the financial crisis, through health-care reform and government shutdowns, through two presidential impeachments, a pandemic and an insurrection attempt, she has been a constant force and consummate operator. No national politician of her era can match her combination of legislative prowess, vote-counting savvy, negotiating skill, and fundraising ability. [time-brightcove not-tgx=\u201dtrue\u201d] On Thursday, it was finally time to move on\u2014sort of. Shortly after noon, she gave a brief speech on the House floor, announcing that she would not seek re-election as leader of the House Democrats. It was time, she said, \u201cfor a new generation to lead the Democratic caucus that I so deeply respect.\u201d Yet she couldn\u2019t bring herself to step away completely: she owed it to her constituents in San Francisco, she said, to stay on as a rank-and-file member of Congress and finish her two-year term. Like the man who fakes his own death and then sneaks into the funeral, she would stick around to see how her people tried to get along without her. Chip Somodevilla\u2014Getty ImagesNancy Pelosi waves to colleagues while being nominated as the next Speaker of the House during a swearing in ceremony for the 110th Congress in the House Chamber of the U.S. Capitol in Washington, DC., on Jan. 4, 2007. Just after her speech, the 82-year-old House Speaker sat at a white-clothed table in a small, ornate room off the House floor known as the Board of Education, a hidden chamber where former Democratic Speaker Sam Rayburn used to hole up and relax. Then-vice president Harry Truman was playing cards with Rayburn here in 1945 when he learned that FDR had died and he would become President. One wall Rayburn had painted with a Texas seal; on two others, Pelosi recently added her own touches: a painting of the Golden Gate Bridge, and a tribute to women\u2019s suffrage. Pelosi was contemplating the not-quite-end of the era and struggling to unwrap a package of chocolate-chip cookies. \u201cWhat was important to me was how we did in the election, because we were on a bad path,\u201d she told a small group of reporters. \u201cStorming the Capitol, really? And the reaction of Republicans, not taking a stand? And I knew we could win.\u201d Her party had just lost the House, weeks after a crazed intruder broke into her California home and bludgeoned her husband with a hammer. But it hardly felt as if Pelosi was giving up in defeat. In an election that history and many forecasters predicted would deliver a Republican wave, Democrats surprisingly held their own. The resulting GOP majority will be a narrow one, with the Senate remaining in Democrats\u2019 hands. The Oct. 28 attack on Paul Pelosi, the Speaker\u2019s husband of 59 years, influenced her decision to remain in Congress, but not in the way many people thought. \u201cIt was not, \u2018Oh, well, since they did that, I can\u2019t even think of something else,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cNo, it had the opposite effect. I couldn\u2019t give them that satisfaction.\u201d Read More: Nancy Pelosi Doesn\u2019t Care What You Think Of Her. This steely tenaciousness, this refusal to let others decide her path, is a running theme of my biography of Pelosi. It has been the hallmark of her political career, from forcing her way into the male-dominated ranks of congressional leadership to standing up to former President Donald Trump. As the youngest child and only daughter of three-term Baltimore mayor Thomas D\u2019Alessandro, politics was in Pelosi\u2019s blood; she first set foot on the House floor as a young child, when her father was serving in Congress. But when she finally ran for office herself at the age of 47\u2014after raising five children and serving for decades as a political fundraiser, strategist and volunteer\u2014it was from a different coast, under a different name, with a political identity all her own. Deanne Fitzmaurice\u2014San Francisco Chronicle/Getty ImagesNancy Pelosi at election headquarters on primary election night, on April 7, 1987. Ask Pelosi about her legacy, and the first thing she\u2019ll mention is the Affordable Care Act. However flawed and incomplete the 2010 law\u2019s guarantee of universal access to health care may have proven, it represented the fulfillment of a century of liberal aspirations, and the pinnacle of Pelosi\u2019s legislative craft. She moved mountains to get it through the House, at one point nearly breaking down in tears as she begged a group of liberal feminists to swallow an unsavory compromise on abortion funding. Then, after a special election robbed Democrats of their supermajority in the Senate, she urged then-President Obama not to give up on the historic legislation. \u201cIf the gate\u2019s closed, you go over the fence,\u201d she said at the time. \u201cIf the fence is too high, we\u2019ll pole-vault in. If that doesn\u2019t work, we\u2019ll parachute in. But we\u2019re going to get health-care reform passed for the American people.\u201d Though most of the drama around the bill\u2019s passage revolved around the Senate, it never could have happened without Pelosi\u2019s determination and drive. Win McNamee\u2014Getty ImagesSpeaker of the House Nancy Pelosi stands behind President Barack Obama as he signs the Affordable Health Care for America Act during a ceremony with fellow Democrats in the East Room of the White House on March 23, 2010. She did it knowing there might be a political cost, and indeed there was. Republicans gained 63 seats in the House in the 2010 midterm elections, an election in which Pelosi was a central figure. Republicans made her the subject of millions of dollars\u2019 worth of attack ads across the country, capitalizing on their base\u2019s visceral loathing of her and giving Peosi unusual prominence for a congressional leader. But Pelosi believed in gaining power not for its own sake but in order to do something with it. Obamacare is part of a legacy that includes two decades of liberal policy victories, from allowing gay people to serve openly in the military to the historic climate investments of this year\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act. \u201cThis is a very difficult job,\u201d she told us. \u201cYou have to really know how to be a legislator.\u201d These legislative successes were all the more remarkable for the era in which they came. Faced with unrelenting Republican opposition, she held together the diverse Democratic caucus and drove a hard bargain in negotiations across the aisle. After Donald Trump became president, she led her party back to power, becoming Speaker for the second time in 2019 in the middle of a government shutdown over border-wall funding. Pelosi refused to budge, and Trump soon capitulated. She would go on to impeach him twice while simultaneously negotiating with his Administration to secure trillions in COVID-19 relief funding.

Pelosi rejects the notion that she bears any blame for the toxic state of politics. \u201cI don\u2019t take any responsibility for what the Republicans have done to the Congress. This is not about gridlock,\u201d she says. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about some sort of equivalence between Democrats and Republicans. They are anti-science, anti-government, and that\u2019s where they are.\u201d The GOP\u2019s lack of decency was apparent in many Republicans\u2019 reaction to her husband\u2019s attack, Pelosi says. \u201cJust think if your spouse were in that situation and people would make a joke of it, like it was funny,\u201d she added. \u201cCollecting money for bail for the perpetrator, putting out a conspiracy theory about what it was about. It\u2019s so horrible to think that the Republican Party has come down to this.\u201d This attitude, she says, was part of what voters recoiled from the midterms. Mark Wilson\u2014Getty Images (2); Chip Somodevilla\u2014Getty Images; Jim Watson\u2014Pool/AFP/Getty Images Pelosi never groomed a successor, something for which she was often criticized. Ambitious Democrats languished for decades waiting for an opening in House leadership. She has often expressed the view that power is never given but must be taken by those who seek it. \u201cI didn\u2019t think that was the right approach, to anoint somebody,\u201d she told us Thursday. \u201cIt\u2019s really important for people to have the legitimacy that they were chosen by the members.\u201d A free-for-all appears unlikely. Pelosi\u2019s longtime deputy Steny Hoyer, a fellow Marylander who has known her since they worked for the same Senator in 1963, announced Thursday that he would also stay in Congress but not in leadership. Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York, the 52-year-old chair of the Democratic caucus, appears almost certain to win the minority leader position in the Democratic leadership elections scheduled for Nov. 30, becoming the first Black man to lead a party in Congress. The first woman Speaker, in passing the torch, will make history once again. Pelosi intends to spend the next two years in valedictory mode. \u201cMy life ahead is full of thank-yous,\u201d she says, to her constituents and all the others who have supported her over the years. She does not plan to serve on any committees and she does not want to serve as a sort of shadow speaker from the sidelines. \u201cThanksgiving is coming,\u201d she says. \u201cI have no intention of being the mother-in-law in the kitchen saying, \u2018My son doesn\u2019t like the stuffing that way, this is the way we make it in our family.\u2019 They will have their vision. They will have their plan. It\u2019s up to the caucus to decide which way they want to go.\u201d",

    "content": "The post How are Bitcoin Long-Term Holders Responding to the BTC Price Crash? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The Bitcoin price has continued to shrink in 2022 since Terra Luna initiated a significant crypto crash in Q1. The FTX and Alameda meltdown has stirred fresh selling pressure, which analysts expect to push through 2023. Moreover, confidence in centralized crypto exchanges has significantly slumped, which may push some to the insolvency route. According to our latest crypto price oracles, Bitcoin is trading around $16,500, up from the recent lows of $15,900. The digital asset is trading 76 percent down from its ATH, $69k, set approximately a year ago. Long-term Bitcoin critic Peter Schiff thinks Bitcoin price is yet to bottom per the current sentiments. Shiff highlighted a scenario where long-term Bitcoin holders sell their bags to sustain themselves\u2014adding that sooner than later, only long-term holders with sustainable paychecks will survive the shakeout. It didn't take long for this forecast to come true. The lion's share of the selling has not even started yet. #Bitcoin still has a long way to fall. https://t.co/dvNtGMIQHq\u2014 Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) November 17, 2022 Nonetheless, long-term Bitcoin holders are optimistic about the overall Btc market, which has significant adoption worldwide. Per on-chain data, long-term Bitcoin holders perceive the current bear market as similar to 2018 one. Glassnode explained: \u201cBitcoin Long-Term Holders are currently experiencing acute financial stress, holding an average of -33% in unrealized losses. This is comparable to the lows of the 2018 bear market, which saw a peak unrealized loss of -36% on average.\u201d Notably, Glassnode data shows that crypto exchanges recorded a sharp uptick in withdrawals toward non-custodial platforms. Reportedly, cryptocurrency exchanges have seen one of the most significant net declines in aggregate BTC balance in history, falling by 72.9k BTC in 7 days. Glassnode Further Notes on Bitcoin Market Outlook Bitcoin (BTC) is a legal tender to two countries -El Salvador and the African Central Republic \u2013 and is regulated as a digital asset in many other jurisdictions. With a hard cap of 21 million Bitcoins and a halving to reduce the overall supply over time, market strategists are optimistic about its long-term success.\u00a0 Nevertheless, global geopolitics and the prevailing macroeconomics continue to push Bitcoin prices to higher volatility. For instance, the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine has significantly divided international regulators on using Bitcoin and other crypto assets.\u00a0 Furthermore, western governments argue that Russia has used Bitcoin and other crypto assets to manoeuvre the set sanctions.\u00a0 However, with the rising global inflation rate, which has significantly reduced fiat currencies\u2019 purchasing power, Bitcoin and other digital assets are expected to record significant cash inflows.",

    "content": "The post Toon Finance DogeCoin Shiba Inu Coin Moon After Elon Musk Seals Twitter Purchase appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News In the past few months, there has been a great deal of discussion over so-called \u201cmeme coins\u201d like DOGE, of which Elon Musk claims to be a large admirer. Since his controversial purchase of Twitter, it has rocketed in popularity. What is a meme coin? A cryptocurrency that is based on or gets its inspiration from an online meme is called a meme coin. The most well-known example of a currency based on a meme is the DOGE, which was designed after the viral image of a Shiba Inu dog known as the \u201cDoge\u201d meme. Other examples of meme coins are UBQ and COIN, both of which are based on popular memes such as \u201cUbiquiti\u201d and \u201cBitcoin,\u201d respectively. The realm of virtual currencies is perpetually undergoing change, with new concepts and technology being presented on a consistent basis. The proliferation of meme coins is a relatively recent phenomenon in this sector.\u00a0 The Support of DOGEcoin by Elon Musk and What It Means for Investors in Cryptocurrencies Elon Musk, CEO of both Tesla and SpaceX, has been a prominent booster of DOGEcoin, which has led to a significant increase in the price of the cryptocurrency. It is possible that there is more to Musk\u2019s backing than meets the eye, despite the fact that some people assume he is just trying to capitalise on the current wave of excitement. In this article, we will discuss some of the reasons that Musk may have endorsed DOGEcoin, as well as what this support may represent for those who have invested in cryptocurrencies. There are a few different hypotheses to consider on the reasons why Elon Musk is such a vocal supporter of DOGEcoin. To begin, it is possible that he just really likes the coin, or that he has faith in its potential in the long run. Second, it is possible that he is trying to raise people\u2019s knowledge about cryptocurrencies in general and the potential that they have as an investment. The third possibility is that he is attempting to create a buzz in order to artificially inflate the price of DOGEcoin (and make a profit in the process). It is important to note that Musk is not the only celebrity to endorse DOGEcoin; other celebrities, such as Snoop Dogg and Gene Simmons, have also shown their support for the cryptocurrency. It is possible that the price of DOGEcoin is being driven even higher by the increased attention it is receiving from high-profile personalities. It is impossible to overlook Elon Musk\u2019s impact on the cryptocurrency market, regardless of whether you are an investor in cryptocurrencies or just someone who is inquisitive about the world of digital currencies. The price of the cryptocurrency has skyrocketed as a direct result of his public promotion of DOGEcoin.\u00a0 Some people assume that he is simply trying to capitalise on the buzz around the cryptocurrency; however, there may be more to his endorsement than meets the eye. The impact that Musk\u2019s continuous support will have on DOGEcoin and the cryptocurrency industry as a whole is something that can only be determined with the passage of time; nevertheless, one thing is certain: he is most certainly someone to keep an eye on. Toon Finance Decnetalized coins are beginning to attract media attention from all over the world as more and more celebrities from across the world enter the field of decentralised finance. Toon Finance is a brand new DEX platform that operates similarly to pancake swaps and will include support for the ERC20 blockchain. Toon Finance is a forward-thinking piece of software that has produced a sizable community of seasoned users, and anyone who is interested in joining the team can do so at no cost. Simply joining their Telegram channel and introducing yourself is all that is required of you at this point. Already having raised more than 2 million dollars in USD during the first week of their presale, Toon Finance is poised to become the Meme token of the year. After many months of planning and preparation, the long-delayed project can now be accessed by the general public. The following is a list of the distinguishing characteristics that set Toon Finance apart from other meme coins, such as Tamadoge and Shiba Inu: Uses the DEX Operating System as its base. The primary feature of the Toon Finance Protocol is that it is a decentralized exchange (DEX) platform. This is a unique characteristic because other meme coins on the market operate on centralized platforms. Toon Finance operates on the DEX to offer investors more security and peace of mind. One of the biggest advantages of the DEX system is that it does not have a central failure point that hackers can attack to harm the users. This is why investors can rest assured that their finances are safer. Another advantage of DEX is that it eliminates the need for a third party to act as a middleman in the transactions.

    "content": "ConsenSys, in collaboration with several crypto companies, is co-launching a climate platform for the world built on the Ethereum PoS consensus protocol. Regulatory authorities have constantly expressed their worries over the effects of crypto mining on the environment. The Ethereum-based software firm, ConsenSys, which played a crucial role in the completion of the much-publicized Merge, has teamed up with many other crypto firms to co-launch the Ethereum Climate Platform (ECP) during the ongoing global climate conference, dubbed COP27. The COP27 is a United Nations Climate Change Global Innovation Hub in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, from November 6\u201318. The climate platform is developed for the Ethereum network and aims to reduce the ecosystem\u2019s excess energy demand, which was the norm before the Merge two months ago. According to Joseph Lubin, co-founder of ConsenSys and a developer of the Ethereum blockchain, the motive is to raise some capital and invest it in high-impact technologies. Lubin stated that the team is expected to find funding for new projects that have technological significance and determine how impactful they will become. Upon the completion of the Merge, Ethereum discontinued its use of the energy-intensive proof-of-work (PoW) to the more energy-efficient proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus protocol. Ethereum, during the PoW stage, was powered by miners who completed several challenging puzzles to add more transactions to the ledger. With the PoS, Ethereum utilizes validators to facilitate transactions on the blockchain while using less energy. After the Merge, the network has drastically reduced its energy use by 99.9%. Part of Lubin\u2019s statement read: \u201cThe Ethereum Merge has raised the bar for reducing climate change across the broader sectors of the global economy. It shows that with a collective drive, technological innovations are possible without increasing carbon emissions.\u201d Rising Concerns about Crypto Mining Even before Ethereum\u2019s transition from the PoW to the PoS, digital asset mining has been the subject of increasing backlash from regulators and environmental activists. Accordingly, the European Commission revealed in October that it plans to ban crypto mining if the region faces a severe energy crisis in the coming winter. As expected, regulatory agencies like the European Union (EU) are proposing ways to reduce PoW activities within the bloc. In October, the European Commission told its member states to be ready to stop crypto mining. In addition, the commission proposes load shedding in the region\u2019s electricity supply as winter approaches. China has since taken a more extreme stance by banning Bitcoin mining and other crypto trading activities in 2021. Other PoW protocols, like Dogecoin and Zcash, also consider switching to PoS due to energy concerns. Ethereum has experienced a significant surge in its price after the Merge, with the network seeing close to a 10% increase. However, the gains were short-lived as ETH could not continue its upward trend 24 hours after the historic transition. ETH currently trades at $1,214 at the time of writing, per our data. However, the token is yet to respond to the latest development as the community hopes for a price increase towards the $2,000 level before the year ends.

    "description": "<p>The United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has publicly censured Mohammad Prodhan, the former Chief Executive Officer of Sonali Bank UK (SBUK), for failing to establish and maintain effective anti-money laundering (AML) systems and controls at the bank. </p><p>The financial markets regulator, which <a href=\"https://www.financemagnates.com/institutional-forex/regulation/sonali-bank-uk-ceo-fined-76400-for-money-laundering/\">fined Prodhan \u00a376,400 in 2018</a>, is now opting to several disapprove the ex-CEO as a result of \u201cexceptional circumstances in this case.\u201d</p><p>These situations include \"Mr Prodhan returning to Bangladesh and no longer having income or assets in the UK; the fact he is no longer in employment in Bangladesh; ongoing personal conditions which limit his ability to travel to the UK for the Upper Tribunal; and the length of time since his misconduct which has been impacted by Covid-delays to the litigation,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.financemagnates.com/tag/financial-conduct-authority/\" target=\"_blank\">FCA</a> explained in a statement <a href=\"https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/fca-issues-final-notice-former-ceo-anti-money-laundering-failings\">released</a> on Friday.</p><p>Furthermore, the financial watchdog noted the Bank of England\u2019s Prudential Regulation Authority has canceled the bank\u2019s authorization. The institution has also been renamed to Sonali Bangladesh (UK) Limited, it said. </p><p>SBUK was founded in 2001 to serve the Bangladeshi community in the United Kingdom. The bank is the product of a partnership between the Bangladesh government and Sonali Bank, a state-owned commercial bank in Bangladesh.</p><p>Prodhan's Offence</p><p>In 2018, the FCA penalized Prodhan for failing to take charge of his AML duties at the SBUK, leading to \u201csystemic failures in SBUK\u2019s AML systems and controls throughout the business.\u201d However, the CEO referred the case to the Upper Tribunal, a UK superior appellate court, where the case was delayed. </p><p>\u201cWhile a financial penalty was appropriate in this case, prolonged litigation to enforce a penalty that is unlikely to be paid against a person who may not be able to travel to the UK to explain himself in person to the Upper Tribunal is neither practical nor fair,\" noted Mark Steward, Executive Director of Enforcement and Market Oversight at the FCA. \"In these exceptional circumstances, a public censure is an appropriate resolution of the case,\u201d Steward added.</p><p>Meanwhile, in 2016, <a href=\"https://www.financemagnates.com/tag/bangladesh/\">Bangladesh</a> appointed Pradhan as the Managing Director of Rupali Bank, a state-owned commercial bank. In 2019, the executive was also selected as the MD of Sonali Bank in Bangladesh. However, FCA in the latest statement said Prodhan is no longer in employment in Bangladesh.</p> This article was written by Solomon Oladipupo at www.financemagnates.com.",

    "content": "Dennis Rodman is one of the raunchiest men in NBA history, but even his experiences didn\u2019t work all the time. Especially not the nights before NBA games. The Bulls legend made a name in the NBA for various reasons. He was notably known as the rebounding king of his time. It\u2019s why he earned the nickname, \u2018The Worm.\u2019 His tough brand of defense and hustle stemmed from his time with the Detroit Pistons, known as the \u2018Bad Boy Pistons.\u2019 He helped the Bulls win three straight championships from 1995 to 1998 after Jordan recruited him. Jordan regularly played the Pistons during their peak, so he knew exactly what he would be getting with Rodman on the team. The Pistons routinely harassed Jordan to the point where they coined the \u2018Jordan rules\u2019, a physical style of play meant to neutralize the greatest player in NBA history. \u201cThe Last Dance\u201d turned to Dennis Rodman, the \u201cBad Boys\u201d Pistons of the late 1980s, the Jordan Rules and the continued turbulence early in the 1997-98 Bulls\u2019 campaign.https://t.co/TJcC04CAYr \u2014 Sun-Times Sports (@suntimes_sports) April 27, 2020 Also Read: \u201cLeBron James just mocked his own LeLiar personality\u201d: Lakers star makes fun of his pathological lying while discussing LeRoy Butler\u2019s Lambeau Leap Dennis Rodman discussed how scandalous experiments before games never worked for him Rodman\u2019s career is defined more by his adventures outside the court than those on it, however. He was a wild man. Rodman loved partying, and he loved to have fun with women. However, for all his crazy stories, Rodman found his breaking point. Even the legendary Rodman had his limits. It was surprising for him, but in the end, he did come to a decision. He was talking to Mike Tyson on his show \u2018Hotboxin\u2019, when he said, \u201cI\u2019ve done this twice in my life playing sports and I never knew that this s**t will f**k with you when you\u2019re playing the game.\u201d What exactly was he referring to? \u201cI\u2019m trying to have s*x all night before the game. Doesn\u2019t f****ng work out too well.\u201d The routine affected his gameplay and his coach even had to talk to him to sort out the issues. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you take a night off? I know what you did last night. You got weak knees right?\u201d Rodman recalled his coach saying. Rodman married himself and earned a cool $10 million Dennis Rodman is a generally wild character, but there are some lengths he\u2019ll go to that will amaze people. Once he even married himself, and the entire stunt netted him a massive profit. Dennis Rodman has a net worth of $500,000 right now, and he once tried to increase that immensely.
