    "description": "Few names are as buzzy in Hollywood and beyond as Sydney Sweeney\u2019s. From her rise in the controversial Sam Levinson show Euphoria to her recent roles in rom-com revival Anyone But You and Marvel\u2019s Madame Web with Dakota Johnson, Sweeney seems to be everywhere. However, in her increasing fame, she\u2019s also stirred up controversy. Sweeney has faced rumors of cheating with her Anyone But You co-star Glen Powell, allegedly lied about working as a tour guide at Universal Studios, and become the Ender of Wokeness, per conservatives, after her appearance on Saturday Night Live. A lot of her buzz and controversy has stemmed from discussions, judgments, and consumption of one thing\u2014her body. As Sydney Sweeney noted during her featured speaker session at South By Southwest on March 12, she\u2019s frequently subjected to objectification by people online. \u201cMy DMs are not a safe space,\u201d she said in response to an audience question. \u201cThere is no respect in those.\u201d However, little recognition has been given to her achievements in the industry at only 26 years old. A shining gem outside of the realm of oft-debated nepo babies, Sweeney grew up in a working-class family in the small town of Spokane, Washington. She\u2019s been vocal about her struggles to make enough money as an actor\u2014even though she appears to be highly successful in the public eye. After scoring breakout roles in shows like Sharp Objects and The White Lotus, she\u2019s now turned her attention to producing. Sweeney revealed that she had to convince her parents to let her audition for an indie film being produced in Spokane when she was 10 years old. So naturally, she created a five-year business plan to present to them. She went on to receive a bachelor\u2019s degree in business, something that informs how she navigates Hollywood. \u201cI am a business,\u201d she said. \u201cYou are a business. Every actor is their own company.\u201d A primary intention of Sweeney\u2019s career is to do things that scare her\u2014and her Saturday Night Live performance was one of those frightening experiences. Despite being an actor, Sweeney said she has terrible stage fright. \u201cIt was terrifying, guys. It was so scary,\u201d she said of her guest appearance on March 2. \u201cMy mouth dried up. I\u2019m having panic attacks thinking about it. But it was so fun.\u2019 The fear continues\u2014in more ways than one\u2014with Sweeney\u2019s upcoming role as Cecilia in the nun horror flick Immaculate, which she also produced. Sweeney called the character her most \u201cterrifying\u201d yet, and the film, premiering at SXSW Film and TV Festival on March 12, has been a long time coming. Sweeney initially auditioned for the role at age 16. She didn\u2019t get the part, but soon after the film fell into industry purgatory. Since 2014, however, Sweeney has been launched into stardom and founded her production company Fifty-Fifty Films. Through her effort, the project actually got made. \u201cI got to make it myself, which when I\u2019m sixteen-\u2014I didn\u2019t know,\u201d she said. \u201cNow, I look back, and I\u2019m like, \u2018Syd, you made it.\u201d While producers are often associated only as names on the checks, Sweeney takes a much more personal route, stating that she \u201cparents\u201d her projects. \u201cI\u2019m part of it from the beginning to the end.\u201d Sweeney wants to ensure her work is a space of equality, considering the group effort that the creation of a film or television show requires. \u201cI truly believe that it takes everybody to create something. It\u2019s not just one person,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to be 50-50 with all of my partners. I want to make sure that everyone has equal deals, feels that they are all equally at the table.\u201d Fittingly, she also gave endless thanks to her collaborators, those who taught her important lessons that she\u2019s carrying forward as a leader in the industry. She cites Sharp Objects director Jean-Marc Vall\u00e9e (\u201cHe saw in me what I hoped other people would see in myself.\u201d), casting director David Rubin, and Michael Mohan, the director of Netflix\u2019s short-lived series Everything Sucks!, as empowering collaborators. Mohan and Sweeney reunited to work on Immaculate, which he also directed. She credited her work with Mohan on Everything Sucks! as the moment she found her own voice on set. \u201cI realized I wanted to be part of more than just acting,\u201d she said. And despite the creeps in her DMs, Sweeney is here for the real fans of her craft. As she noted, \u201cBeing able to connect with so many people through my characters is why I do it.\u201d Sign up to receive the Daily Dot\u2019s Internet Insider newsletter for urgent news from the frontline of online.

    "description": "South Korea has remained muted to a new gold rush fueled by various central banks across the world gobbling up the precious metal, raising concerns that Asia\u2019s fourth-largest economy would be one of a handful of nations missing out on the great profit-making opportunity. According to the World Gold Council on Tuesday, total gold holdings by central banks across the globe added 39 tons in January, extending the latest gold run after reaching 1,037.4 tons in 2023 and 1,081.9 tons in 2022. Over the past two years, the total net purchase of gold by foreign central banks exceeded 2,000 tons, with China leading the pack. The world\u2019s second-largest economy has added 300 tons of the precious metal to its foreign reserves since the People\u2019s Bank of China renewed buying it in October 2022. As of the end of 2023, the central bank\u2019s gold reserves amounted to 2,235.3 tons. Its counterpart in India also upped its gold reserves to 803.5 tons in 2023 from 754.1 tons in 2021, while the National Bank of Poland shoveled in 130 tons of the precious metal between April and November last year. Thanks to the revived global appetite for gold, its price hit a new record of $2,195.15 per troy ounce on March 8. Gold prices retreated to the $1,600 level at the end of 2022 from $1,800 earlier that year but started rebounding last year. Considering the latest price hikes, foreign central banks stockpiling gold are estimated to have enjoyed about 30% return from their gold holdings. Korea\u2019s central bank, however, has not joined the new gold race, with its gold reserves unchanged at 104.4 tons since 2013. TOO LATE TO JUMP ON THE BANDWAGON The main reason that the Bank of Korea is hesitant to up its gold stock is the current gold price, which could be at its peak after the recent rally.The Korean central bank bought 90 tons of gold from 2011 to 2013 at an average price of $1,629 per troy ounce. But soon the gold price plummeted, hovering between $1,100 and $1,300 from 2014 to 2018. The BOK was estimated to have logged about 1.8 trillion won ($1.4 billion) loss from its gold holdings in 2015 due to the price drop. The bank also cites the difficulty of cashing out gold because this safe-haven asset is considered a country\u2019s last resort to safeguard against severe national economic meltdown. The sudden disposal of gold is often seen as a red flag for a country\u2019s economy. Another excuse to distance itself from the latest gold run is the lower return of gold investment than other assets. According to the Bank of Korea, the risk-adjusted annual return of gold investment has averaged at 0.26% since 1973, lower than that of US treasury investment at 0.96% and stock investment at 0.44%. MORE ROOM TO GROW Still, some economists argue that the Korean central bank should consider jumping on the latest gold bandwagon as the most precious metal is forecast to extend its rally longer. \u201cThe price of gold, a typical safe-haven asset, is expected to climb higher once the US starts cutting interest rates, and uncertainty over the global economy grows after the US presidential election later this year,\u201d said Seok Byoung-hoon, professor at the Department of Economics of Ewha Womans University. \u201cIt is time for the Bank of Korea to rebalance its asset portfolio.\u201dGold made up only 1.7% of the Asian country\u2019s foreign exchange reserves. But earlier this year, the bank's official said Korea\u2019s central bank does not have an imminent plan to buy more gold for its foreign exchange reserves.

    "description": "U.S. stocks experienced a rise on Tuesday following consecutive losses for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq. What Happened: This positive turn occurred despite a slightly warmer-than-expected February consumer price index. As per CNBC\u2019s Jim Cramer, the market\u2019s gains were largely unrelated to the CPI, but instead tied to \u201ca lot of stocks reacting positively to good earnings per share news.\u201d \"We're getting lucky that the S & P is up like this,\" Cramer said. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon expressed optimism about the U.S. economy on Tuesday, suggesting the Fed should hold off on interest rate cuts until after June. While acknowledging the possibility of a recession, Dimon believes the market is pricing in a soft landing. See Also: This Could Be A Gamechanger For Natural Gas In Europe Cramer echoed Dimon\u2019s optimism, attributing positive equity movements to solid corporate earnings and ongoing interest in artificial intelligence. This was reinforced by Oracle\u2019s (NYSE:ORCL) strong quarter, attributed to AI strength, which boosted shares by approximately 11%.
