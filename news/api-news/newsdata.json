    "description": "Few names are as buzzy in Hollywood and beyond as Sydney Sweeney\u2019s. From her rise in the controversial Sam Levinson show Euphoria to her recent roles in rom-com revival Anyone But You and Marvel\u2019s Madame Web with Dakota Johnson, Sweeney seems to be everywhere. However, in her increasing fame, she\u2019s also stirred up controversy. Sweeney has faced rumors of cheating with her Anyone But You co-star Glen Powell, allegedly lied about working as a tour guide at Universal Studios, and become the Ender of Wokeness, per conservatives, after her appearance on Saturday Night Live. A lot of her buzz and controversy has stemmed from discussions, judgments, and consumption of one thing\u2014her body. As Sydney Sweeney noted during her featured speaker session at South By Southwest on March 12, she\u2019s frequently subjected to objectification by people online. \u201cMy DMs are not a safe space,\u201d she said in response to an audience question. \u201cThere is no respect in those.\u201d However, little recognition has been given to her achievements in the industry at only 26 years old. A shining gem outside of the realm of oft-debated nepo babies, Sweeney grew up in a working-class family in the small town of Spokane, Washington. She\u2019s been vocal about her struggles to make enough money as an actor\u2014even though she appears to be highly successful in the public eye. After scoring breakout roles in shows like Sharp Objects and The White Lotus, she\u2019s now turned her attention to producing. Sweeney revealed that she had to convince her parents to let her audition for an indie film being produced in Spokane when she was 10 years old. So naturally, she created a five-year business plan to present to them. She went on to receive a bachelor\u2019s degree in business, something that informs how she navigates Hollywood. \u201cI am a business,\u201d she said. \u201cYou are a business. Every actor is their own company.\u201d A primary intention of Sweeney\u2019s career is to do things that scare her\u2014and her Saturday Night Live performance was one of those frightening experiences. Despite being an actor, Sweeney said she has terrible stage fright. \u201cIt was terrifying, guys. It was so scary,\u201d she said of her guest appearance on March 2. \u201cMy mouth dried up. I\u2019m having panic attacks thinking about it. But it was so fun.\u2019 The fear continues\u2014in more ways than one\u2014with Sweeney\u2019s upcoming role as Cecilia in the nun horror flick Immaculate, which she also produced. Sweeney called the character her most \u201cterrifying\u201d yet, and the film, premiering at SXSW Film and TV Festival on March 12, has been a long time coming. Sweeney initially auditioned for the role at age 16. She didn\u2019t get the part, but soon after the film fell into industry purgatory. Since 2014, however, Sweeney has been launched into stardom and founded her production company Fifty-Fifty Films. Through her effort, the project actually got made. \u201cI got to make it myself, which when I\u2019m sixteen-\u2014I didn\u2019t know,\u201d she said. \u201cNow, I look back, and I\u2019m like, \u2018Syd, you made it.\u201d While producers are often associated only as names on the checks, Sweeney takes a much more personal route, stating that she \u201cparents\u201d her projects. \u201cI\u2019m part of it from the beginning to the end.\u201d Sweeney wants to ensure her work is a space of equality, considering the group effort that the creation of a film or television show requires. \u201cI truly believe that it takes everybody to create something. It\u2019s not just one person,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to be 50-50 with all of my partners. I want to make sure that everyone has equal deals, feels that they are all equally at the table.\u201d Fittingly, she also gave endless thanks to her collaborators, those who taught her important lessons that she\u2019s carrying forward as a leader in the industry. She cites Sharp Objects director Jean-Marc Vall\u00e9e (\u201cHe saw in me what I hoped other people would see in myself.\u201d), casting director David Rubin, and Michael Mohan, the director of Netflix\u2019s short-lived series Everything Sucks!, as empowering collaborators. Mohan and Sweeney reunited to work on Immaculate, which he also directed. She credited her work with Mohan on Everything Sucks! as the moment she found her own voice on set. \u201cI realized I wanted to be part of more than just acting,\u201d she said. And despite the creeps in her DMs, Sweeney is here for the real fans of her craft. As she noted, \u201cBeing able to connect with so many people through my characters is why I do it.\u201d Sign up to receive the Daily Dot\u2019s Internet Insider newsletter for urgent news from the frontline of online.

    "description": "South Korea has remained muted to a new gold rush fueled by various central banks across the world gobbling up the precious metal, raising concerns that Asia\u2019s fourth-largest economy would be one of a handful of nations missing out on the great profit-making opportunity. According to the World Gold Council on Tuesday, total gold holdings by central banks across the globe added 39 tons in January, extending the latest gold run after reaching 1,037.4 tons in 2023 and 1,081.9 tons in 2022. Over the past two years, the total net purchase of gold by foreign central banks exceeded 2,000 tons, with China leading the pack. The world\u2019s second-largest economy has added 300 tons of the precious metal to its foreign reserves since the People\u2019s Bank of China renewed buying it in October 2022. As of the end of 2023, the central bank\u2019s gold reserves amounted to 2,235.3 tons. Its counterpart in India also upped its gold reserves to 803.5 tons in 2023 from 754.1 tons in 2021, while the National Bank of Poland shoveled in 130 tons of the precious metal between April and November last year. Thanks to the revived global appetite for gold, its price hit a new record of $2,195.15 per troy ounce on March 8. Gold prices retreated to the $1,600 level at the end of 2022 from $1,800 earlier that year but started rebounding last year. Considering the latest price hikes, foreign central banks stockpiling gold are estimated to have enjoyed about 30% return from their gold holdings. Korea\u2019s central bank, however, has not joined the new gold race, with its gold reserves unchanged at 104.4 tons since 2013. TOO LATE TO JUMP ON THE BANDWAGON The main reason that the Bank of Korea is hesitant to up its gold stock is the current gold price, which could be at its peak after the recent rally.The Korean central bank bought 90 tons of gold from 2011 to 2013 at an average price of $1,629 per troy ounce. But soon the gold price plummeted, hovering between $1,100 and $1,300 from 2014 to 2018. The BOK was estimated to have logged about 1.8 trillion won ($1.4 billion) loss from its gold holdings in 2015 due to the price drop. The bank also cites the difficulty of cashing out gold because this safe-haven asset is considered a country\u2019s last resort to safeguard against severe national economic meltdown. The sudden disposal of gold is often seen as a red flag for a country\u2019s economy. Another excuse to distance itself from the latest gold run is the lower return of gold investment than other assets. According to the Bank of Korea, the risk-adjusted annual return of gold investment has averaged at 0.26% since 1973, lower than that of US treasury investment at 0.96% and stock investment at 0.44%. MORE ROOM TO GROW Still, some economists argue that the Korean central bank should consider jumping on the latest gold bandwagon as the most precious metal is forecast to extend its rally longer. \u201cThe price of gold, a typical safe-haven asset, is expected to climb higher once the US starts cutting interest rates, and uncertainty over the global economy grows after the US presidential election later this year,\u201d said Seok Byoung-hoon, professor at the Department of Economics of Ewha Womans University. \u201cIt is time for the Bank of Korea to rebalance its asset portfolio.\u201dGold made up only 1.7% of the Asian country\u2019s foreign exchange reserves. But earlier this year, the bank's official said Korea\u2019s central bank does not have an imminent plan to buy more gold for its foreign exchange reserves.

    "description": "U.S. stocks experienced a rise on Tuesday following consecutive losses for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq. What Happened: This positive turn occurred despite a slightly warmer-than-expected February consumer price index. As per CNBC\u2019s Jim Cramer, the market\u2019s gains were largely unrelated to the CPI, but instead tied to \u201ca lot of stocks reacting positively to good earnings per share news.\u201d \"We're getting lucky that the S & P is up like this,\" Cramer said. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon expressed optimism about the U.S. economy on Tuesday, suggesting the Fed should hold off on interest rate cuts until after June. While acknowledging the possibility of a recession, Dimon believes the market is pricing in a soft landing. See Also: This Could Be A Gamechanger For Natural Gas In Europe Cramer echoed Dimon\u2019s optimism, attributing positive equity movements to solid corporate earnings and ongoing interest in artificial intelligence. This was reinforced by Oracle\u2019s (NYSE:ORCL) strong quarter, attributed to AI strength, which boosted shares by approximately 11%.

The Geoff Keighley-run event has quickly become one of the key events on the games industry's calendar, as several notable projects, big and small, have been announced there. With E3 now completely dead, SGF could be poised to take the expo's place as the anchor for the various gaming events that typically take place in early June.

    "description": "Elden Ring is a huge container of weapons, armor, and all sorts of items. One of the most possibly useful consumable items of the bunch is the Celestial Dew, as it bestows upon the player the power to revive NPCs and thus correct some, ugh, possible \"accidents\" that might occur during the main quest. You might end up never needing Celestial Dew, but this is the Lands Between, a place where it's just best to be prepared for everything at all times, so let's see where to find it. Celestial Dew Locations in Elden Ring You can find Celestial Dew not in one, but in many places in Elden Ring, so I'll just leave you with all of the known locations below in descending order of easier to hardest to get: In my opinion, the easiest Celestial Dew you can get is at Raya Lucaria Academy. Simply teleport or reach the Academy's main gate, then follow the direction below to reach a gate and a corpse holding one Celestial Dew. The map doesn't show it very well, but it's just a simple corridor. Just pay attention to the basic enemy that'll drop from the sky to protect the Dew, and you should be fine. You can also buy Celestial Dew from an NPC named Pidia at Caria Manor. To get there, I recommend you teleport to Ranni's Rise, then move to this position: Screenshot by Destructoid That's the exact location of Pidia, but getting there might be a bit tricky as it requires players to find a specific entrance in a lower position. Luckily, there's this Scarab on the way marking the drop point (really). Screenshot by Destructoid From the Scarab's POV, you'll see: Screenshot by Destructoid You'll need to fall down where marked, then a few more times until you get to the roof with this entrance on it: Screenshot by Destructoid You'll find Pidia, a friendly NPC, right by you as soon as you reach the bottom of the ladder. That's one of the easiest ways to get Celestial Dew in the game. The Ainsel River, despite being an underground area, is a great place for Celestial Dew hunters because you can either buy them from the merchant there or get two additional dews at the Uhl ruins: Screenshot y Destructoid Another great option is Nokron's Eternal City. The Ancestral Woods is a great starting point: Screenshot by Destructoid Once there, just drop down to the roof, move forward, drop down again, and turn right. At the corner, you will be able to see a Dew-carrying corpse. Screenshot by Destructoid Another good place is Leyndell. Get to the site of grace on the Sanctuary, walk up the tree to the upper floor, move to the rooftop, and re-enter the sanctuary through the window. On that floor, you'll find a chest with the Erdtree bow and then, if you keep going past the chest, you'll find a dead guy holding one Celestial Dew. Screenshot by Destructoid I believe this would arguably be the easiest Celestial Dew to get by itself if not for the fact that it's in a late-game area, and thus not immediately ready for players to get. You better start stocking up on Celestial Dew because Elden Ring Shadow Of The Erdtree comes out on June 21, and things are about to get wild.

    "description": "In recent news, Chubb Ltd (NYSE:CB) CEO, Evan Greenberg, has stood by the company\u2019s decision to underwrite the appeal bond of former President Donald Trump in a defamation lawsuit filed by E. Jean Carroll. What Happened: Greenberg, in a customer communication, clarified that Chubb\u2019s role as the surety does not imply support for any party involved in the case. \u201cWe don't take sides, it would be wrong for us to do so and we are in no way supporting the defendant,\u201d he stated, according to a report by The Hill. Last week, Trump signed paperwork for one of Chubb's divisions to underwrite his $91.63 million bond as he appeals the recent civil verdict against him for defaming Carroll, an advice columnist, by denying her sexual assault claims. Greenberg stressed that Chubb\u2019s decision was based on supporting the rule of law and not influenced by personal feelings. He also indicated that Trump\u2019s bond is fully collateralized, although the specifics of the assets put down by Trump remain undisclosed.

    "description": "South Korean rental platforms have become a headache for private equity firms, with their declining profits and dim business outlook making them hard to sell.In 2019, a handful of small-sized homegrown private equity houses snapped up domestic rental service companies each for around 100 billion won ($76 billion) to emulate MBK Partners\u2019 eye-popping exit from the sector leader Coway Co. that produced more than a four-fold return after five years of investment.Five years on, Cactus Private Equity and Daishin Private Equity are struggling to divest of BS On Co. a company that leases office equipment and home appliances. Their consortium put it up for sale in September last year, but has not yet to find its new owner due to a big valuation gap with bidders, according to investment banking industry sources on Wednesday.The two homegrown investment firms jointly acquired BS On for 100 billion won in 2019. Since then, operating profit at BS On has decreased to 11.9 billion won in 2022 and 12.1 billion won in 2021, versus 16.4 billion won in 2019.SV Investment and AJ Capital Partners were another Seoul-based PE houses betting on rental platforms.Thy took over MostX, formerly Modurental, for 100 billion won in 2019. It leases products ranging from household goods to massage devices and pet care products from some 150 brands.Despite its diverse assortment of leasing products, the company\u2019s operating profit more than halved to 4.2 billion won in 2022, compared to 10 billion won in 2020. Sales decreased to 65.6 billion won versus 91.5 billion won over the same period. AJ Capital Partners is a unit of AJ Networks and AJ Rent-A-Car and has no relation to the Tennessee-based investment firm with the same name. In 2019, PS Alliance and Dream Security, a cybersecurity and authentication service company, acquired Korea Rental Corp. for 115.0 billion won. The rental company has been faring poorly since their purchase.Industry observers said domestic rental platforms appear to have reached their growth limit.They are highly dependent on manufacturers, which are now switching to directly leasing their products after building brand awareness on rental platforms.High interest rates have taken a toll as well. Rental companies borrow money from banks or other financial institutions, offering subscription contracts with their customers as collateral. Elevated financing costs have held them back from swiftly responding to the hit product cycle.North Asia-focused MBK Partners reaped more than a fourfold return, or over 1 trillion won, from the exit of its controlling stake in Coway, a rental company of air and water purifiers and bidets, five years after investment.By Jin-Eun Hahazzys@hankyung.com Yeonhee Kim edited this article",

    "description": "Passwords stored in Chrome are convenient, but they can also expose you to risk. Share your device with someone else, and they can log into any website with saved credentials. At least, they can if you haven\u2019t enabled Chrome\u2019s built-in protections. On Windows PCs, you can use Windows Hello to lockdown access to your Chrome passwords. When turned on, you\u2019ll have to enter a PIN or use a biometric authentication method (like a fingerprint or webcam) before Chrome will fill in a login form with your user name and password. Here\u2019s how to enable the feature.

You should be able to skip to Step 2. (However, if you don\u2019t see the option for Windows Hello in Google Password Manager\u2019s settings, return to this step.) The Sign -in options in Windows 10. In the Windows 10 or 11 start menu, type sign-in options \u2014 or open your Settings app and use the search bar to find the sign-in options. Your PC won\u2019t support the biometric methods of Windows Hello authentication without a compatible fingerprint reader or webcam, but a PIN code should be available to set up. Note: Any Windows Hello method you set up will allow you to log into your PC. If you have concerns about the security of the biometric options, you can stick with just a PIN code \u2014 ideally one that\u2019s at least six numbers long. Step 2: Head to Chrome\u2019s settings In a Chrome window, click on the three dot icon in the upper right of the screen. Then choose Settings > Autofill and Passwords > Google Password Manager. In the left navigation bar, select Settings. You can also type chrome://password-manager/settings into the address bar of a Chrome tab and hit enter. Step 3: Turn on Windows Hello protection Flipping that toggle will turn on Windows Hello verification on this PC.PCWorld In the Google Password Manager settings, find Use Windows Hello when filling passwords. Click on the toggle to enable this feature, then enter your PIN code or use an alternate Windows Hello method to authenticate the change. The toggle will then move to the right and turn blue. After you\u2019ve turned on Windows Hello verification, a pop-up window will appear with an authentication check before Chrome will fill in your saved login info.

Why? You\u2019re safer from headaches if that Google account is ever compromised or lost. Plenty of excellent options exist, both free and paid \u2014 but the paid options offer nicer perks, like being able to give emergency access to your passwords, more sophisticated forms of two-factor authentication, and easier password sharing. These options can integrate with your phone and PC, so you can still seamlessly create, store, and use your credentials.

Beyond Windows Hello verification, you can also use antivirus software (like Avast One) to safeguard against malicious apps that try to steal saved browser passwords.

    "description": "Macworld Few computer-related disasters can quickly drain the color from your face quicker than losing a document you\u2019ve been busily working on. Whether your Mac crashed or froze, you forgot to save, or you accidentally clicked on delete, all might not be lost. We\u2019ll show you how you can recover that vanished Word document. If everything is working as it should then it\u2019s quite hard to lose a file in Word. Word has an autosave feature that means that in the event of an accident, you should still have the bulk of your work, except for the last ten minutes. Our top tip would be to save a document as soon as you start working on it to ensure that it autosaves regularly. But that\u2019s not why you\u2019re here. If you\u2019ve opened Word and can\u2019t find that document you were working on don\u2019t panic! There is a good chance that you can get your document back. In this article, we\u2019ll run through the various ways you can recover an unsaved or deleted Word document. How to recover an unsaved Word doc We\u2019ll run through a few scenarios that you might have been confronted with to recover that Word document for you. As we said above, the good news is that Word for Mac has a built-in autosave feature called AutoRecover. This means that Word is quietly saving the document you are working on without you needing to manually tell the software to do so. For this feature to function properly, however, you\u2019ll need to initially save the document with a name, and then Word will make incremental saves every ten minutes. However, even if you haven\u2019t done this Word will still save your document and you should be able to find a version of it in the AutoRecover folder. Below we will run through how to get to the AutoRecover folder and some other steps you can take to recover your document. Scenario 1: You are working on a Word document and you have to restart your Mac without a chance to save first Solution: Open Word again to see an autosaved version of your document. The good news is that if you are using an up-to-date version of Word then just opening up Word again should recover the document\u2014or at least a very recent version of it. This is because Word autosaves your document \u2013 even if you haven\u2019t saved it yet. This is even though at the top of the Window you will see an AutoSave button, which may be off. (Switch that button on and you\u2019ll see a request to save your document.) Scenario 2: Opening Word doesn\u2019t load up the document you were working on Solution: Find it in the AutoRecovery folder. Open the Finder. Click on Go in the menu. Click on Go To Folder. Paste in the following: ~/Library/Containers/com.microsoft.Word/Data/Library/Preferences/AutoRecovery This will open your AutoRecovery folder where you will find the AutoRecovery versions of your documents even though you didn\u2019t save them. Having found the document you may not be able to open it, in which case you may need to try the steps in the next scenario\u2026 Scenario 3: Word won\u2019t open the AutoRecovery version of your document Solution: Drag the file into a different text editor app When you try to open the AutoRecovery file (either by clicking on it or trying to drag it onto the Word icon in the Dock) you may see a message claiming that Word experienced an error trying to open the file. One of the suggestions may be to open the Text Recovery Converter. Here\u2019s what we did: Open TextEdit. Drag the file onto the TextEdit icon in the Dock. Copy the text into a new file in Word. Scenario 4: In a moment of madness you clicked on Don\u2019t Save or Delete Solution: Find the most recent version in the AutoRecovery folder The great news is that even if you didn\u2019t save your Word document \u2013 even the best of us have clicked Don\u2019t Save by accident when we were closing documents \u2013 you can recover it from the AutoRecovery folder. However, it is really difficult to locate as it is locked away in a hidden Library folder. Luckily there is a simple way to view that folder. Just click on Go > Go To Folder in the Finder\u2019s Go menu and paste the following: ~/Library/Containers/com.microsoft.Word/Data/Library/Preferences/AutoRecovery This will open your AutoRecovery folder where you will find the AutoRecovery versions of your documents even though you didn\u2019t save. If you are thinking you might be able to locate that folder directly in the Finder, notice that the ~ symbol means that it is a hidden folder, so it\u2019s easier to cut and paste the above address. Scenario 5: You made a mistake and want to go back to an older version Solution: Browser through recent versions It\u2019s not always the case that you lose the whole document. Sometimes you might lose some of the work you have done, which can be just as traumatic if you\u2019ve spent a lot of time on it. As long as you have made an initial save of the document you should be able to browse the version history: With the Word document open click on File. Select Browse Version History. In the right-hand column, you\u2019ll see the version history. Locate a version of the document from before you made the mistakes you wish to correct. Click on Open Version. This will open a second copy of your document. Either click on Restore (to go back to this version of the document) or Compare (if you don\u2019t want to recover the whole document and just want to copy and paste the bit you need). Other ways to recover a lost Word document If the above doesn\u2019t work, or your version of Word is older than the current one, try the steps we outline below. Check the Trash In some cases, your file might be missing because you deleted it. It\u2019s easily done when you are trying to make room on your Mac and you remove a load of old files only to realize that one of them was crucial. Luckily this isn\u2019t as disastrous as it sounds. The document might still be found in the Trash. Click on the Trash can icon in the Dock to open it. You\u2019ll now see the contents of the Trash. Look for your file. If you click on a file and press Space Bar you may be able to see a preview of it. If you don\u2019t see your file look for a \u2018Recovered Items\u2019 folder in the Trash. It\u2019s possible that your file is located in that. If it\u2019s there you\u2019ll need to right-click on it and choose Put Back. This will place the file back in the folder where it was originally saved and you can continue to work on it. Try data recovery software There are third-party apps that may be able to help you recover your document if the above advice doesn\u2019t help. Disk Drill Disk Drill will scan your storage for free and show you the files that can be recovered using the tool (so you don\u2019t have to pay before you know if it will be able to find your file). To recover the file you\u2019ll need to pay for the full version of Disk Drill here (\u00a383.28/$89). EaseUS EaseUS Data Recovery Wizard will scan the drive or volume where you lost the files. Once the scan is complete you can view Unsaved Documents. Double-click to see a preview of the file and click Recover to recover it. There is a free version that has a 2GB recovery limit, which may well be enough for your needs. Get it here. (Full version costs $69.95 a month, cancel at any time, or $99.95 a year) For details of some other apps that might help you recover your files, check out our round up of the best data recovery apps, which also includes Stellar Data Recovery, RecoverIt, Data Rescue. Find AutoRecovery for older versions of Word Since you might not have the latest bersion of Word we\u2019ll detail the steps below for you to follow to locate that Word AutoRecovery folder. How to find the AutoRecovery folder in Word 2016 Here\u2019s how to find AutoRecover in Word 2016: In Word 2016, the AutoRecovery folder is buried deep in the system and requires your Mac to display hidden files, so the first step is to reveal these secret folders, to do so we recommend following our advice at the link below, although the key combination to use is cmd + shift + . (full stop). Read: How to show hidden files and folders on a Mac. With this done you\u2019ll need to open Finder then click on the Home icon in the left-hand column (it\u2019s usually your name). Now navigate to the following folder: Library/Containers/com.microsoft.Word/Data/Library/Preferences/AutoRecovery/ If you have any AutoRecovery files then they will be in here. One thing to remember is that AutoRecovery files are temporary and only exist if they think that Word shut down unexpectedly. So, if you clicked Don\u2019t Save rather than Save when you were closing the document there won\u2019t be an AutoRecovery file for it. How to find the AutoRecovery folder in Word 2011 If you are using Word 2011 it\u2019s easy to locate the AutoRecovery folder: Click on the File option in the Menu bar then search for Autorecover. If you use Word often then there might be a few different Autorecover files, so check the date to see which one matches your missing item. Once you\u2019ve found the document just click on it to open it up, then remember to save it again under a new name. Even if you don\u2019t find your document in the AutoRecovery folder, it may not be the case that it isn\u2019t there. Files in the AutoRecover folder don\u2019t always show up. We have first-hand experience of this. In the past, our Mac has \u2018helpfully\u2019 saved a Word document in the Office 2011 AutoRecovery folder. This would not be an issue, except for the fact that when we then accessed the folder (just a quick search in Spotlight for Office 2011 AutoRecovery) the files were nowhere to be seen. As you can see from this screen grab, the most recent file in our AutoRecovery folder was from 5 March, but we know that there are more recent files saved there. The problem with the AutoRecovery file is that it is located in a Library folder that isn\u2019t visible by default, and that will have some impact on whether your files are visible or not. Fortunately, there is a way to locate the file. How to view files in Office 2011 AutoRecovery folder Go to the Finder, and press Alt (or Option) while selecting Go from the menu at the top of the page. This will make the Library folder visible (if you don\u2019t press Alt you won\u2019t see it \u2013 and you have to keep Alt pressed or it will vanish). Click on Library to open the Libray folder. Locate the following folder: Application Support > Microsoft > Office > Office 2011 AutoRecovery. When you see the Office 2011 in this view you should be able to locate your file. Recover old versions of documents via Time Machine While Word has its own Version History that only works if you have saved the file at some point. Plus, if you have subsequently deleted the document by accident you can\u2019t open it to open an older version. In that case, you could try Time Machine. If you have a Time Machine backup on an external drive you can roll back to a time when a deleted or corrupted file was still on your system. Go to the folder where you\u2019d hope to see your file, or an earlier version of your file. Open Time machine and flick back through the day, weeks or months to see if your file is there. We\u2019ll keep our fingers crossed for you. Follow our Complete guide to Time Machine for instructions on how to recover your files. If you are unfortunate enough not to have a backup routine then we suggest beginning one immediately. Macs are very reliable machines, but there is always a risk of something going wrong, so it\u2019s best to protect yourself against potential disaster. Try looking at our How to back up a Mac feature that highlights several solutions for this essential practice. What if you never saved your file \u2013 if in a moment of madness, you clicked on Don\u2019t Save rather than Save? It happens! Can you retrieve your file? Recover lost docs from the Temporary folder Your Mac also has a folder where it might temporarily keep files. The Temporary folder isn\u2019t easy to find though. To find the Temporary folder, use Terminal (find it in Applications > Utilities > Terminal, or Spotlight search for Terminal by pressing Command + Space. Open Terminal Type: open $TMPDIR Press Enter. Inside this TMP folder, you should find a folder called Temporaryitems. It\u2019s possible that your document might be inside. Tips to avoid lost Word files Avoid this nightmare happening again \u2013 follow the tips below. Save first, save often It goes without saying that you should save frequently especially if your Mac can be a bit unreliable. You may be able to rely on Word autosaving for you, but remember that you have to save the file first to really benefit from Autosave. Change the autosave frequency A helpful thing to know is that you can reduce the gaps between autosaves on Word for Mac. By default they are set at ten minute intervals, but it\u2019s easy to make them more frequent. In Word go up to the Menu bar at the top of the screen and click on Word. From the dropdown menu select Preferences and then in the Output and Sharing section you\u2019ll see a disk icon named Save. Click this and you\u2019ll now be able to adjust the time between saves by entering a value into the \u2018Save every X minutes\u2019 box at the bottom. While it might be tempting to set it as low as possible, bear in mind that Word\u2019s performance could be be hampered slightly if it\u2019s saving every minute, especially if you are working on a large file. Experiment to see what setting works best for you. You may also find one of these articles helpful: How to recover deleted files. Want to get to know Word better? Read our Top tips for Word for Mac.

    "description": "Another indie title has been released that\u2019s giving players some much-needed relaxation: Summerhouse. There\u2019s no combat, no movement, and nothing to stress you out except the limitations of your own imagination. Plus, there are collectibles, and that\u2019s always a good thing. Summerhouse, a game by independent developer Friederman, is all about building using a limited number of tiles and decor items. You start the game with only a few tiles to build with. As you place them down, you\u2019ll start to get new pieces featuring people and animals that will bring your creations to life--if you're lucky. Screenshot by Destructoid Summerhouse is about building houses and feeling the vibe Summerhouse is reminiscent of playing with building blocks, either as a child myself or with my daughter now. The possibilities are only limited by what you can imagine - you can build a giant castle or a tiny cottage, hang laundry between the windows and put climbing vines all over the walls. Or, if you feel like it, you can build a skyscraper that looks like it would topple over in reality. The limit does not exist. You technically don\u2019t even need walls. You can place windows, doors, and endless decor pieces wherever you like, as long as it's within the building boundaries set out by the level. There\u2019s no limit to how many objects you can place, so you can make incredibly cluttered designs that somehow end up looking as though they were always meant to look that way. At least, that\u2019s the hope. Screenshot by Destructoid Although Summerhouse lacks stress, it doesn\u2019t lack frustrations, though they have more to do with expectations vs reality than with the game itself. I\u2019ve played a lot of hours of Summerhouse, and I have found it difficult to create buildings that live up to the ideas I have in my head when starting a build. That said, I have, at times, begun to play and then somehow lost three hours before I look at the clock again. It\u2019s incredibly easy to get lost in the simple art style, and if you\u2019re not a fan of the default pixelated look, you can turn that off in the settings to give the game a smoother look. The wind blowing through the trees in the background and the quiet, calming music adds to the atmosphere, allowing you to simply relax and wile away the hours. Getting new building blocks in Summerhouse is not only easy but enjoyable, and some of them are absolutely adorable. For instance, by placing some power lines next to some swaying grass, two pieces that you have from the outset, you\u2019ll be rewarded with a new block featuring a little sheet ghost who comes to visit at night time. Screenshot by Destructoid You can make up your own stories for the people who show up, like the dog who sits on the steps waiting for his owner or the mysterious caller who stays on the pay phone all day. Summerhouse is a game of imagination, and it\u2019s got a shocking low base price on Steam of $4.99 USD. At that price, what have you got to lose?
